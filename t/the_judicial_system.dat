5|$|The Indian {{government}} has {{taken steps to}} alleviate some of the current gender inequalities. In 1992, the government of India established the National Commission for Women. The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, {{the slow pace of}} change in <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women.|$|E

5|$|At {{the local}} level, the island's 22 provinces are {{administered}} by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further sub-divided into regions and communes. The judiciary is {{modeled on the}} French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance. The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> of the Orange Free State {{was rather}} amateurish and {{haphazard}} in character, particularly {{because most of}} the judges were legally unqualified. Most of the judicial procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> {{and legal}} codes of the Weimar Republic {{remained}} in use {{during and after}} the Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the {{government}} has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the federal structure, {{the government}} is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a bicameral body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms. <b>The</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> the oldest in America, consists of a hierarchy from the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia to the Circuit Courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts.|$|E

5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E
5|$|The {{council was}} a {{virtually}} full-time institution {{by the late}} fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council {{were some of the}} great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how <b>the</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E
