The sickness swept through eastern Europe as an epidemic causing high mortality rates. It arrived in Switzerland in December, then was carried northwards to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and eastwards to Lithuania, Poland and Russia.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Japanese {{prepared}} to launch their attack, the Allies launched the airborne {{phase of the}} second Chindit expedition on 5 March 1944. Japanese officers such as Major-General Noburo Tazoe, commanding the Japanese Army Air Force units in Burma, urged Mutaguchi to divert troops from his offensive to secure the Japanese rear areas against the Chindits. Mutaguchi dismissed these concerns, claiming <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks he would occupy the air bases from which the Chindits were supplied.|$|E

When Totten’s son, Captain James Totten, then commanding a U.S. Army artillery battery at the arsenal, cast his lot with the Union, following the seizure of the Little Rock Arsenal, the battery promptly changed its name to the Pulaski Light Artillery. Little did they know <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short months they would be facing Totten's guns in battle.|$|E

Civilians {{in the occupied territories}} had to endure many large-scale massacres, including <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Nanking. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians leading to an estimated 200,000 dead. Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the levees of the Yangtze to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, Nanjing. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is a temptation to simply leave a problem without resolving it. If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years somebody will move and the problem will disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse. Studies show that many brats become very adaptable {{as a result of}} the mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of Avoidant Personality Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder.|$|E
25|$|During the honeymoon, Max {{prepares the}} {{children}} to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter, demands to know why they are not flying {{the flag of the}} Third Reich now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of developments, he refuses to allow {{the children to}} sing. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years Liesl will be married ("Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.|$|E
25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and audio-video materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million babies are born every year which means <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years time, more individuals will assert ownership over {{their share of the}} (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, there are too many students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino administration has done in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 has tripled. Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E

25|$|It was {{alarming}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{months after}} the Sandinista revolution, Nicaragua received international acclaim for its rapid progress {{in the fields of}} literacy and health. It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.|$|R
500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome".

2500|$|The {{placement}} of the example species follows a 1990 systematic treatment; it may be outdated. Subfamilies are tentatively sorted in a phylogenetic sequence, from the most basal to the most advanced. Traditionally, the Archiearinae were held {{to be the most}} ancient of the geometer moth lineages, as their caterpillars have well-developed prolegs. However, it now seems that the Larentiinae are actually older, as indicated by their numerous plesiomorphies and DNA sequence data. They are either an extremely basal lineage of the Geometridae [...] together with the Sterrhinae , or might even be considered a separate family of Geometroidea. As regards the Archiearinae, some species that were traditionally placed therein actually seem to belong to other subfamilies; altogether it seems <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases, the prolegs which were originally lost in the ancestral geometer moths re-evolved as an atavism.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{birth is}} the {{beginning}} of the separation between mother and child, breastfeeding slows this process, making the mother and infant connect physically continually, sometimes for years.

Unlike Doihara, who was always very polite and constantly stroked Puyi's ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, addressing Puyi like he was barking out orders to a particularly dim-witted common soldier. Puyi's chief adviser Zheng Xiaoxu had been promised by Itagaki that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity sufficiently enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself, as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644. In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian [...] "Sage King" [...] out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who was going to end the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.|$|E
