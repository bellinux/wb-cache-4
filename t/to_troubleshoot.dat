5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E

25|$|Technical diving {{encompasses}} multiple {{aspects of}} diving, that typically share lack of {{direct access to}} surface, which {{may be caused by}} physical constraints, like an overhead environment, or physiological, like decompression obligation. In case of emergency, therefore, the diver or diving team must be able <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> and solve the problem underwater. This requires planning, situational awareness, and redundancy in critical equipment, and is facilitated by skill and experience in appropriate procedures for managing reasonably foreseeable contingencies.|$|E
25|$|Improving engine {{reliability}} {{and ease of}} maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced {{with a set of}} six common hand tools. The F135's health management system is designed to provide real time data to maintainers on the ground. This allows them <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt & Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{considered}} to be of such high strategic importance that it attracted personal visits from many of the Nazi régime's most elite officers; Heinrich Himmler and SS-Obergruppenführers Hans Kammler and Gottlob Berger visited in September 1943, and Adolf Hitler visited in the spring of 1944. The commander of the site was Major-General Dr Walter Dornberger, leader of Nazi Germany's V-2 rocket program. Wernher von Braun, creator of the V-2, the central figure in Germany's pre-war rocket development program, and post-war director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, worked at the Blizna test site and personally visited the test missile impact areas <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> any problems discovered during trials.|$|E

25|$|On the station, {{the crews}} {{continued}} to work on transfer operations, and continued work on the water reclamation system. During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that a sample {{was taken from the}} Water Processor Assembly that contained 10% urine and 90% condensate, and would be returned to the ground with the shuttle. Kerrick noted that if activation of the system continued on schedule, a sample from the potable water dispenser would be taken on flight day eleven. The ground crew continued <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> the Urine Processor Assembly, looking at whether there is a sensor touching part of the system’s centrifuge as it rotates, which might be causing it to slow down.|$|E
25|$|Mosby {{finally got}} the Department of Justice post he wanted as Philander Knox ended his term as {{attorney}} general. It was not with the trust-busting unit, however, but with the Bureau of Insular and Territorial affairs, where Mosby worked (at a low salary of $2,400/year) under his brother-in-law Charles W. Russell from 1904 to 1910. In 1905 President Roosevelt again sent him to Alabama <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> allegations of irregularities at the Port of Mobile. Next, {{he was sent to}} Oklahoma to investigate charges against U.S. Marshall (and former Rough Rider) Benjamin Colbert. He also secured an indictment of McAlester attorneys George Mansfield, John F. McMurray and Melvin Cornish for misappropriation of Indian Trust funds, but his superior Russell thought the evidence insufficient and ultimately dropped the charges two years later. Meanwhile, Mosby went back to investigate charges of land frauds against Indian minors, and on his return found little to do.|$|E
25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} series of approximations for decision-theoretic {{troubleshooting}} under uncertainty. Our approach generates troubleshooting plans {{in the face of}} uncertainty in the relationships among components and device status, observations, as well as the affect of actions on device status.

There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How {{are we going to get}} to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Like all Progress spacecraft, M1-5 carried two docking systems, Kurs and TORU. The {{automated}} Kurs {{system was}} the primary docking system, with TORU, which required manual input, as the backup. Because Mir was unmanned {{at the time of}} its docking, and a cosmonaut aboard the station would have been required to perform a TORU docking, or <b>to</b> <b>troubleshoot</b> any other problems during the docking, the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft was made ready for a flight to Mir should human intervention be required. The Soyuz may also have been launched if the flight control system aboard Mir failed. Cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov were originally scheduled to have been on standby for this mission, with Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin, the crew who eventually flew TM-32 to the International Space Station, as the backup crew. [...] However, in December 2000, they were replaced by Gennady Padalka and Nikolai Budarin, a crew which became known as Expedition Zero. These cosmonauts were chosen because of their training for a similar emergency mission to the International Space Station the previous year, which would have been launched if the Zvezda module had failed to dock. If a manned flight had been launched, controllers would have waited until after it had landed to begin the deorbit of Mir.|$|E
