500|$|In {{making the}} announcement, Clinton {{said that he}} had {{considered}} men for the post and that [...] "I never felt hamstrung by any commitment, even though I did want to name a woman Attorney General." [...] When asked how he would have handled the selection were he <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again, Clinton responded, [...] "I would have called Janet Reno on November 5th." ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{stories have}} surfaced. About {{to lead his}} men into action, Niven eased their {{nervousness}} by telling them, [...] "Look, you chaps only {{have to do this}} once. But I'll have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again in Hollywood with Errol Flynn!" [...] Asked by suspicious American sentries during the Battle of the Bulge who had won the World Series in 1943, he answered, [...] "Haven't the foggiest idea, but I did co-star with Ginger Rogers in Bachelor Mother!" [...] On another occasion, asked how he felt about serving with the British Army in Europe, he allegedly said, [...] "Well on the whole, I would rather be tickling Ginger Rogers' tits." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{spectacular}} casts I've ever been lucky enough to be a part of," [...] Tobolowsky wrote. When he was shooting the scene where he and McDonnell eat at a Chinese restaurant, Robinson told him he could do anything he wanted to make her laugh. [...] "Dangerous words. It set the tone for the rest of the shoot," [...] he recalls. [...] "I played with my food. I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date)." [...] The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|E

60|$|In the end, Grace did go, {{a little}} puzzled and {{doubtful}} still, but thankful beyond words {{to escape the}} drudgery of the counter and the noise and heat of the city. Bertha went home, feeling a little bit blue in secret, it cannot be denied, but also feeling quite sure {{that if she had}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again, she would do just the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] said Mr. Hyndman; {{unfolded}} {{the slip}} and read out: [...] "Why trouble to agitate or work if the Trusts are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for us?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "An' {{next week}} we got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again," [...] he said sadly. [...] "An' what's {{the good of}} it all, hey? Sometimes I wish I was a hobo. They don't work, an' they get their livin'. Gee! I wish I had a glass of beer; but I can't get up the gumption {{to go down to}} the village an' get it. You'll stay over, an' send your books dawn by express, or else you're a damn fool." ...|$|E
60|$|March 8.--Spent {{the morning}} in reading proofs and {{additions}} to Magnum. I got a note from Cadell, in which Ballantyne, by a letter enclosed, totally condemns Anne of Geierstein--three volumes nearly finished--a pretty thing, truly, for I will be expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again. Great dishonour in this, as Trinculo says,[269] besides an infinite loss. Sent for Cadell to attend me next morning that we may consult about this business. Peel has made his motion on the Catholic question, with a speech of three hours. It is almost a complete surrender to the Catholics, and so it should be, for half measures do but linger out the feud. This will, or rather ought to, satisfy all men who sincerely love peace, and therefore all men of property. But will this satisfy Pat, who, with all his virtues, {{is certainly not the}} most sensible person in the world? Perhaps not; and if not, it is but fighting them at last. I smoked away, and thought of ticklish politics and bad novels. Skene supped with us.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is simply}} because I {{have given him}} a fold of skin between the front and hind leg on each side," [...] {{explained}} Old Mother Nature. [...] "When he jumps he stretches his legs out flat, and that stretches out those two folds of skin until they look almost like wings. This is the reason he can sail so far when he jumps from a high place. You've seen a bird, after flapping its wings to get going, sail along with them outstretched and motionless. Timmy does the same thing, only he gets going by jumping. You may have noticed that he usually goes {{to the top of}} a tree before jumping; then he can sail down a wonderfully long distance. His tail helps him to keep his balance. If there is anything in the way, he can steer himself around it. When he reaches the tree he is jumping for he shoots up a little way and lands on the trunk not far above the ground. Then he scampers up that tree <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and I don't {{want you}} to think that I don't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> my <b>doing</b> now; and if my sister was <b>all</b> against <b>it,</b> I should wish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the same." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Quack {{stopped and}} shivered. [...] "It {{seems to me}} I have heard nothing but the noise of those terrible guns ever since we started," [...] said she. [...] "I haven't had a good square meal for days and days, nor a good rest. That is what makes me so dreadfully nervous. Sometimes, when we had been driven {{from place to place}} until we had caught up with Jack Frost, there would be nothing but ice {{excepting}} in small places in a river where the water runs too swiftly to freeze. We would just have to drop into one of these to rest a little, because we had flown so far that our wings ached as if they would drop off. Then just as we would think we were safe for a little while, there would come the bang of a terrible gun. Then we would have to fly again as long as we could, and finally come back to the same place because there was no other place where we could go. Then we would have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again until night came. Sometimes I think that those men with terrible guns must hate us and want to kill every one of us. If they didn't, they would {{have a little bit of}} pity. They simply haven't any hearts at all." ...|$|E
