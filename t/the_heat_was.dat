5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E
25|$|Electricity output (gross) was 1,735,579 ktoe (20,185 TWh), {{efficiency}} was 39%, and {{the balance}} of 61% was generated heat.

25|$|During the 1970–1974 summers, the Seabees {{constructing}} the dome were housed in Korean War era Jamesway huts.

25|$|Some rectifiable {{shortcomings}} were cylinders with old-fashioned short-travel valves with Z-ported cylinders, plain bearings on {{the inner}} carrying wheels that were inclined to run hot and a cab that was too small and unbearably hot in summer. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> made worse by the steam turret, vacuum-brake ejector and sight-feed lubricator that were placed inside the cab. Since the seats of the driver and stoker were mounted on poles which allowed them to be swung around to outside the cab, crews could often be seen riding outside to escape the heat.|$|E
25|$|The Hawks {{opened the}} series with a 26-point win after leading {{by as much}} as 20 points at halftime. The Hawks also tied a {{franchise}} record for fewest points allowed in a playoff game.

The Heat won Game 3 at home, almost in similar fashion as the Hawks' victory in Game 1. <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>was</b> already leading by 19 points at halftime and ended up winning by 29 points.

25|$|During power operation, {{heavy water}} was {{circulated}} by primary pumps through the U-tubes containing the fuel assemblies which heated the water. The heated water then flowed through an inverted U-tube steam generator where <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred to the}} secondary side light water which turned to steam. The steam flowed to an oil-fired superheater which increased the steam quality before the steam entered the turbine which spun the electrical generator. After passing through the steam generator, the primary loop water was pumped back to the reactor by the primary pumps to repeat the cycle. The primary loop heavy water was pressurized {{to ensure that the}} heavy water remained liquid and did not flash to steam at any point in the loop.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> stultifying and few duties were {{required}} of an officer. Judging from Medwin's description, he {{spent many hours}} enthusiastically hunting wildlife.

He witnessed at least one incident of sati, the ritual burning of a widow, on the Narmuda river in 1818, and enthusiastically toured the classical Hindu temples of: Gaur, Palibothra, Jagganath and Karle, as well as the Elephanta Caves and the Ellora Caves. Medwin may have had an affair with a Hindu woman which ended badly, but through whom he was introduced to the doctrines of Rammohan Roy. He was almost drowned in an accident on the Ganges.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, Van Cise made it well known he was going on a long fishing {{vacation}} to the Rocky Mountains, signaling to the gang members that <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> off their operation. While the con men plied their trade openly {{on the streets of}} Denver, Van Cise and his assistants plotted a huge roundup that required a willing victim to help catch the gang in the act. With incredible good fortune, J. Frank Norfleet showed up in Denver at precisely this moment. Norfleet was a Texas rancher who had previously been scammed twice by other gangs and was on a nationwide manhunt to bring the men who swindled him to justice. Entering the lobby of the Brown Palace Hotel, Norfleet was hooked by unwitting gang members who saw him as an easy mark, and the plan was set in motion.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Menshikov {{began to}} move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong {{garrison}} (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences. By venturing into {{the interior of the}} Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; {{with the rest of his}} army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to look down on the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.|$|E

500|$|On 31 July 1862, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Charles H. McBlair, Atlanta {{conducted}} her sea trials down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski. The ship proved to be difficult to steer, and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft. This latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near Savannah. She also leaked significantly, and her design virtually eliminated air circulation. One report said that [...] "it was almost intolerable on board the Atlanta, there being no method of ventilation, and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> intense."
