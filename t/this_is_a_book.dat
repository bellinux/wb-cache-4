5|$|Doug Kennedy: The Songs and Guitar Solos of Bert Jansch, New Punchbowl Music, 1983. Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of music, it {{contains}} {{a great deal of}} biographical information and photographs of Bert Jansch.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that contradicts {{itself a}} hundred times; {{but that is}} not a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; {{but that is not}} a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that clatters {{around in}} a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

[...] Erhard's foreword notes: [...] "although this book dramatizes the highlights of the training and attempts to give you the vicarious experience of being at a training, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> and the est experience cannot result from reading any book".|$|E
500|$|The book {{continued}} to garner positive reviews and comments. In 1998, Amanda Foreman wrote for The Sunday Times of London, [...] "I want to shout about The Phantom from the rooftops.

500|$|David had {{intended}} to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section {{of the book is}} a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include [...] "Do not Despair over Rice", [...] "Making Ice Cream", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless".

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The School Librarian, Valerie Caless wrote, [...] "Overall, this is a {{thorough}} historical guide to the political parties, and will serve as a very useful reference book for students of both history and politics at all levels. A glossary or 'concepts' guide would have been a bonus for the new or less patient student." [...] N.W. Polsby of the University of California, Berkeley reviewed the book for Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, and wrote, [...] "The total absence of bibliographical aids is a weakness of this book. Its strengths are its plainly factual and accessible writing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> to be consulted, not read straight through. Recommended at all levels." [...] A review in Reference & Research Book News said, [...] "The book is intended as an affordable reference book for the general reader interested in British politics". The History of British Political Parties was also reviewed in Parliamentary Affairs.|$|E
500|$|The Calcutta Review starts {{by noting}} that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that cannot be done justice in a brief notice, that Wallace is a most eminent naturalist, and chiefly known as a Darwinian. the book was the most {{interesting}} to cross the reviewer's desk since Palgrave's Arabia (1865) and Sir Samuel Baker's Explorations of the Nile (1866). By combining geography, geology and ethnology into one narrative, the reader is saved [...] "the monotony of traversing the same regions several times". The review describes in detail Wallace's findings of different birds and mammals {{either side of the}} Wallace line. It notes Wallace's cheerfulness and good temper in the face of [...] "the difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel", such as having to cross [...] "a hundred miles of open sea in a little boat of four tons burthen", which Wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable. The reviewer remarks that Wallace was [...] "set down as a conjuror by these simple people" [...] with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country, but is less admiring about Wallace's moralising tone, especially when he supposes that [...] "wild communities" [...] can be happier than [...] "in a more highly civilised society". The review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little-known the Malay Archipelago is in India, given that they were closely connected with Hindu temples in Java and Bali, and hopes that soon there will be some [...] "productions" [...] of the archipelago in the Indian Museum of Calcutta.|$|E

2500|$|The plot is {{in large}} part focused on the eponymous [...] "boarding house", in fact a brothel. There are three correspondents of the [...] "black notebook", which obsess about the themes other than death: [...] "Book of the Flesh", [...] "Book of the Wine", [...] "Book of the Soul". The sexual act is again {{depicted}} in key moments of the book, showing Sinidis' first sexual experience, with a laundress, or his later intercourse with [...] "a cow-woman" [...] (according to Simuț, these scenes are passionate but not in fact obscene). The needy Lenny Pipersberg and her daydreaming prostitutes reify the feeling of inadequacy—the girl Nora despises the natural green of her hair, and kills herself in desperation. According to Pîrjol, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of [...] "quasi-theatrical melancholy", alternating the [...] "cruel" [...] and the [...] "implausible-bucolic", especially adept at describing [...] "abjection".

2500|$|You Couldn't Make It Up (1995, Heinemann, [...] ) – {{named after}} one of Littlejohn's catchphrases, and {{described}} [...] on the jacket as [...] "a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom", <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate [...] "fat cats", the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said: [...] "...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way – when he is far too intelligent a man really {{to believe that we}} have nothing to learn from any of them – but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement."

2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you are in for a treat. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> to add to every collection of historical fiction.” Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in Library Journal that this is a novel that “fans of Jack Higgins’s thrillers will enjoy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) {{praised the}} novel in the 8 December 1961 issue of The Guardian: [...] "Mrs Agatha Christie is our nearest {{approach}} to perpetual motion. And {{not only does}} she never stop, but she drops {{the ball into the}} cup nearly every time; and if one is sometimes reminded of those automatic machines where one pulls a handle and out pops the finished product, that is a compliment to the automatic machine and not by any means a reflection on Mrs Christie. For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. The Pale Horse is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty. The black magic theme is handled in a masterly and sinister fashion, and to give away what lay behind it would be unforgivable. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss." [...] Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's Critic's choice {{for the end of the}} year, published one week later, writing that [...] "It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items. The best puzzle has certainly been Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse." ...|$|E
