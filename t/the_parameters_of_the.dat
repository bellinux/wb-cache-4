5|$|Significant {{progress}} in Big Bang cosmology {{has been made}} since the late 1990s {{as a result of}} advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP.

5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emission.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
25|$|The {{learning}} rule is an algorithm which modifies <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neural network, {{in order for}} a given input to the network to produce a favored output.
