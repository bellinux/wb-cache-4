25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make a significant contribution <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because {{of the magnitude of}} loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{third most}} {{important}} source for {{this period of}} Munster history are the Annals of the Four Masters, but they were compiled much later and are occasionally of doubtful reliability, suffering in some cases from interpolations, misplaced entries, and so on. They also cover little of Ivar himself and serve mostly for the major sources above to be checked against in places. A few other sources briefly mentioning Ivar survive but altogether these do not contribute much if anything <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> of him. The Annals of Tigernach might have been of assistance but they no longer survive for over two centuries between 766 and 974.|$|E

Since the war he has demonstrated in an exact and controlled field survey the association between cigarette smoking and the incidence of cancer of the lung, and has been the leader in the development in medicine of the precise experimental methods now used nationally and internationally in the evaluation of new therapeutic and prophylactic agents.|$|E

500|$|... "Missing link" [...] {{is still}} a popular term, well {{recognized}} by the public and often used in the popular media. It is, however, avoided in the scientific press, {{as it relates to}} the concept of the great chain of being and to the notion of simple organisms being primitive versions of complex ones, both of which have been discarded in biology. In any case, the term itself is misleading, as any known transitional fossil, like Java Man, is no longer missing. While each find will give rise to new gaps in the evolutionary story on each side, the discovery of more and more transitional fossils continues to add <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> of evolutionary transitions.|$|E
500|$|The Romans contributed {{little to}} the {{foundations}} of botanical science laid by the ancient Greeks, but made a sound contribution <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> of applied botany as agriculture. In works titled [...] four Roman writers contributed to a compendium Scriptores Rei Rusticae, published from the Renaissance on, which set out the principles and practice of agriculture. These authors were Cato (234–149 BC), Varro (116–27 BC) and, in particular, Columella (4–70 AD) and Palladius (4th century AD). Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) deals with plants in Books 12 to 26 of his 37-volume highly influential work [...] in which he frequently quotes Theophrastus but {{with a lack of}} botanical insight although he does, nevertheless, draw a distinction between true botany on the one hand, and farming and medicine on the other.|$|E
