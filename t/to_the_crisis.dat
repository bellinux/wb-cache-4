40|$|<b>The</b> thesis seeks <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> {{motivation}} for New Zealand's response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sociopolitical and economic crises in Africa. New Zealand's response is conceptualised to include 'foreign aid' {{as well as}} the non-traditional forms of international assistance such as peacekeeping and monitoring, political and moral support on issues such as apartheid. Qualitative research methodology is used to critically examine both the official bilateral response and the response of the non governmental organisations (NGOs). In the context of existing theory, New Zealand's response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> in Africa has significant elements of both the functional utility approach (McKinley and Little 1977) and the conventionalist framework (Gordenker 1976). Official policy espouses both, although the balance between the pursuit of foreign policy interests and altruistic response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> is difficult <b>to</b> attain. <b>The</b> thesis concludes that while New Zealand's political and moral response was an important factor in the resolution of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> of apartheid, <b>the</b> overall official response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> socioeconomic and developmental crises is ineffective. Development partnership between New Zealand NGOs and local NGOs and communities in Africa has been a more effective response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> developmental <b>crises.</b> International development partnership with African countries and communities based on longer term commitment to processes which enhance sustainable socioeconomic progress and social justice is recommended as a strategy for maximising the effectiveness of international response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> in Africa...|$|R

5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not known}} as a {{reformer}} before his appointment, Robert returned in 1051 from Rome, where {{he had gone to}} be confirmed by the papacy, and opposed the king's choice for Bishop of London {{on the grounds that the}} candidate was not suitable. Robert's attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king. When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled, following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric. The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand's support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> in 1052. Stigand was the first non-monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of Dunstan (archbishop from 959 to 988).|$|E

As the 2nd Infantry Regiment marched towards the front on the morning of November 26, the PVA 113th Division intercepted the regiment and destroyed its command post, scattering the ROK II Corps' entire reserve in the process. With most the ROK II Corps' units destroyed by November 27, the UN right flank had fallen to the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In July 1957, {{relations}} between Quwatli's ally Saudi Arabia and {{the governments of}} Iraq and Jordan, rivals of Syria, warmed considerably to the protestations of the leftist current in Syria, which viewed the growing ties between the region's conservative monarchies with distress. After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets in Saudi Arabia and withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of some in the Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order {{to shut down the}} communist newspaper Al Sarkha.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, {{and more than}} 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E

5|$|The Sandomierz {{articles}} {{produced by}} the rebels were concerned mostly with placing further limitations on the monarch's power. Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed {{out of it and}} demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's position would remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. Whatever was left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> of authority was arrived at. But the victorious lords of the council had at their disposal no effective political machinery necessary to propagate the well-being of the Commonwealth, still in its Golden Age (or as some prefer Silver Age now), much further.|$|E

They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E
