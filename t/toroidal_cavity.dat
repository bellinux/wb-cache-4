The 6.9 litre 4-cylinder unit gave 85 bhp at 1800rpm, and the 10.35 litre 6-cylinder unit developed 150 bhp at 1800rpm. These were aimed at both vehicle, marine, and stationary markets, {{and there was a}} horizontal version of the 6-cylinder unit for flat underfloor mounting. The same two engines were rated at 60 and 90 bhp for continuous marine use at 1600rpm, and a larger engine of similar design rated at 130 bhp and of 15.5 litres capacity was also listed. One of the unusual features of these engies is the ability to swap the utilities from side to side and from end to end, which also allows for making handed-engines for twin-engined marine craft. For marine use helical reduction gears of different ratios, and epicyclic reversing gears were also available. Many engines were supplied to their neighbour in Fallings Park, Guy Motors for use in their buses and trucks. A small number of diesel engines was supplied for British Rail Railbuses in 1958. They also powered the Fowler Challenger crawler tractors, the 6DC-630 in the Mk III, and the 6DJ-970 in the Mk IV. Meadows adverts show they were also used in plant like rock-crushers, ditch diggers, compressors and other equipment used in road building. They were also used to power military FV2502 27.5kVA generator sets.|$|E

The approach uses concepts from the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Since the mathematics may be unfamiliar to the general reader, before the derivation for toroidal systems is executed, the differential equation for an optical system with radial symmetry will be derived using the general mathematical approach. After some of the theorems and formalisms associated with toroidal systems are presented, a description of general toroidal systems and their actions on electromagnetic fields will be presented. The action of systems on electromagnetic fields will {{be shown to be}} a linear representation of a group (locally). Having established the preliminaries, the differential equation can be derived. The desired differential equation is derived in three steps. In the first step, a set of differential operators that appear in a simplified equation are derived by recognizing them as the basis of a Lie algebra representation associated with the local linear representation on electromagnetic fields. In the second step, coefficients for the reduced problem are derived. Finally, the complete differential equation is presented. Algorithms that allow one to implement the above results will be presented. These algorithms will be used to execute a computation in a numerical example.

Associated with printer array head work, our laboratory used the results of ‘ 12 -petal with hole type flower PQR array’ invention. In particular, SPS analysis and studies of flower PQR thermal properties are described. Next, preliminary work on nano flower PQR laser which is an advanced type of 12 -petal flower PQR laser is introduced. For nano flowers, I created a new design of flower PQR laser which has up to 72 -petal in a circle of 10 μm diameter. We collaborated with NCNT regarding an e-beam lithography and ICP-RIE etching process for nano flower PQR fabrication. The realization of nano flower PQR laser leads us to fabrication of high power and high density PQR array which can be powerful candidates for next generation semiconductor light source...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{the study}} of stress {{concentration}} can be made using experimental, analytical or numerical analysis. Since this matter has been widely studied {{and it is hard}} to make even a short review of it, only key points and particular examples will be covered. It should be mentioned that experiments sometimes cannot be carried out and are usually labor consuming and numerical methods nearly always require software support and great computing resources. It is considered that stress concentration research started with the work (Kirsch 1898) studying hole-weakened infinite plate. Reviews (Sternberg 1958 and Neuber and Hahn 1966) contain a lot of information on this matter. The works (Vorovich and Malkina 1967 and Sternberg et al. 1949) provide solutions from some elementary cases. Stress distribution inside and around spheroidal inclusions and voids has been made (Tandon and Weng 1986). The analytical functions of the Kolosova-Muskhelishvili complex variable (Muskhelishvili 1977) are used to solve problems of plane elasticity theory; power Fourier series are applied for a circle-bounded area and integrals of Cauchy type—for elliptic holes. Method of integral equations is also used to solve spatial elasticity problems; {{the study of}} stress state of piecewise-connected and multiply connected bodies and bodies with cuts is performed {{on the basis of this}} method (Parton and Perlin 1982). With allocation of analytic and generalized analytic function system to spatial problems, some of them such as a space with a <b>toroidal</b> <b>cavity</b> and a non-axisymmetric problem for a space with a spherical cavity can be solved (Aleksandrov and Solovyev 1978). Circular and elliptical gaps in an elastic medium, a small spherical cavity in a twisted cylindrical rod, and some other problems are considered in the research (Lurie and Belyaev 2010). Some axisymmetric problems are usually solved either in displacements using the Lame equations or with the help of the Love function (Love 1944; Edwards 1951; Noda et al. 2003; Noda and Moriyama 2004). It should be mentioned that when solving specific problems it is difficult to provide solution subjection to boundary conditions because of the complex boundary values. Thus, when using the Love function in boundary conditions for the given displacements, second derivatives appear and with stresses given the third derivatives of the Love function. When using two harmonic functions, order of their derivatives in stress and displacement expressions is lower, but the boundary value problems for these functions’ determination are not independent. In both cases, solution can be represented as Legendre polynomials series. Moreover, existing analytical methods have cavity shape limits, for example, when considering a cubic cavity or cavity with a sharp boundary between the faces, singularities of the stress-strain state are likely to appear or they are limited by the problem symmetry. Despite a great number of works published, researchers still keep interest in problems of stress concentration around various cavities, inclusions, inhomogeneities, reentrant corners, and the like. In quite new works (Yang et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2008; Paskaramoorthy et al. 2011), (Mi & Kouris 2013; Lukić et al. 2009) different aspects of the stress concentration problem are considered.|$|E
