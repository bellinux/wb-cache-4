40|$|International audienceObjectives: Transmitted drug {{resistance}} (TDR) can impair {{the response to}} first-line antiretroviral therapy. In treatment-naïve patients chronically infected with HIV type 1 (HIV- 1), it was previously shown through Sanger sequencing that TDR was more common in {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) than in other <b>transmission</b> risk <b>groups.</b> We aimed to compare two HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of the presence of TDR mutations. Methods: We investigated, through Sanger sequencing and ultradeep sequencing (UDS), the presence of resistance mutations, both in majority (> 20 %) and in minority (1 − 20 %) proportions, in 70 treatment-naïve MSM and 70 treatment-naïve heterosexual patients who recently screened positive for HIV- 1. Results: The global prevalence of TDR was not significantly different between the two groups, either by Sanger or by UDS. Nevertheless, a higher frequency of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor TDR was observed among heterosexual patients (P = 0. 04). There was also a trend for a higher frequency of TDR among MSM infected with HIV- 1 subtype B compared with MSM infected with HIV- 1 non-B subtypes (P = 0. 06). Conclusions:Ultradeep sequencing UDS allowed sensitive monitoring of TDR, and highlighted some disparities between <b>transmission</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

In some cases they might even have their own generation assets as well.

40|$|Abstract — To {{save the}} {{precious}} wireless network resources, the mobile wireless networks demand high bandwidth efficiency of error-control schemes for mobile multicast services, which {{is defined as}} the average fraction of data packets among all the packets (including redundancy packets) transmitted. We derive an upper-bound of bandwidth efficiency and its supremum for hybrid ARQ-FEC schemes applied in mobile multicast with diverse reliability Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, which suggests that a large <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size is necessary and effective to achieve high bandwidth efficiency. By introducing the concept of effective packet-loss probability for mobile multicast, we explain the obtained upper-bound and develop a method to provide guidance for selection of the <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size. To achieve high bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast, we propose an efficient correlated random mapping structure for the adaptive graph-code-based error-control scheme, which can closely approaching the least upper-bound of bandwidth efficiency with the increasing of <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size. Furthermore, by analyzing the effective packet-loss probability under burst losses, which frequently occur in mobile wireless networks, we apply the block interleaving scheme to improve the bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results which evaluate the performance of our proposed schemes. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve high bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast under various reliability-QoS requirements and channel conditions.

The model offers us a significant insight into loss characteristics of <b>group</b> <b>transmission,</b> which is essential to design reliable wireless protocols.

30|$|In China, CRF 01 _AE was {{the most}} {{predominant}} strains circulating in the sexual <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> (including heterosexuals and homosexuals), and CRF 07 _BC and CRF 08 _BC were major circulating among injection drug users (IDUs) (Yang et al. 2002; Su et al. 2000; Piyasirisilp et al. 2000). We investigated the potential association between HIV- 1 genotypes and the risk behaviors. In the heterosexuals, the most predominant strains were CRF 01 _AE (58.8  %), followed by CRF 07 _BC (23.5  %). Similarly, in the homosexuals, the most predominant stains were also CRF 01 _AE (61.5  %), followed by CRF 07 _BC (23.1  %). In addition, among the only two IDUs, one was CRF 01 _AE and another was B/C recombinant. The emergences of relatively high proportions of CRF 07 _BC in the sexual <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> and of CRF 01 _AE among IDUs might suggest an increasing trend of HIV- 1 transmission between different risk groups.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{public health}} efforts often use {{molecular}} technologies {{to identify and}} contain communicable disease networks, but not for HIV. Here, we investigate how molecular epidemiology {{can be used to}} identify highly related HIV networks within a population and how voluntary contact tracing of sexual partners can be used to selectively target these networks. METHODS: We evaluated the use of HIV- 1 pol sequences obtained from participants of a community-recruited cohort (n = 268) and a primary infection research cohort (n = 369) to define highly related transmission clusters and the use of contact tracing to link other individuals (n = 36) within these clusters. The presence of transmitted drug resistance was interpreted from the pol sequences (Calibrated Population Resistance v 3. 0). RESULTS: Phylogenetic clustering was conservatively defined when the genetic distance between any two pol sequences was less than 1 %, which identified 34 distinct transmission clusters within the combined community-recruited and primary infection research cohorts containing 160 individuals. Although sequences from the epidemiologically linked partners represented approximately 5 % of the total sequences, they clustered with 60 % of the sequences that clustered from the combined cohorts (odds ratio 21. 7; P < or = 0. 01). Major resistance to at least one class of antiretroviral medication was found in 19 % of clustering sequences. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic methods can be used to identify individuals who are within highly related <b>transmission</b> <b>groups,</b> and contact tracing of epidemiologically linked partners of recently infected individuals can be used to link into previously defined <b>transmission</b> <b>groups.</b> These methods could be used to implement selectively targeted prevention interventions...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} new quantum-mechanical {{approach}} to scattering a particle on a one-dimensional (1 D) system of two identical rectangular potential barriers, which implies modelling the dynamics of its subprocesses [...] transmission and reflection [...] at all stages of scattering. On its basis we define, for each subprocess, the dwell {{time as well as}} the local (exact) and asymptotic (extrapolated) group times. Our concept of the asymptotic <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> time confirms the validity of the Wigner phase time in the opaque limit, as well as the existence of the usual and generalized Hartman effects predicted on its basis. On the energy scale, this concept is valid everywhere in the high energy region {{as well as in the}} low energy region, excepting resonance points and their neighborhoods. On the contrary, the Buttiker dwell time is valid, as the transmission time, just only at the resonance points. Our concept of the transmission dwell time predicts monotonous growth of the tunneling time when the distance between the opaque barriers increases. By our approach only this time scale yields the true time spent, on average, by transmitted particles in the region occupied by the system. We explain why the asymptotic and local <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> times cannot play this role and why the concept of <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> velocity lies beyond the scope of special relativity. And else, all the transmission times admit only indirect measurements. Hence the unambiguous interpretation of all tunneling-time experiments is impossible when the transmission dynamics at all stages of scattering is unknown.
