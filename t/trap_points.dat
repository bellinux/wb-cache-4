40|$|We {{develop a}} Lagrangian {{approach}} {{based on the}} influence functional method so as to derive self-consistently the Langevin equation for the inflaton field {{in the presence of}} <b>trapping</b> <b>points</b> along the inflaton trajectory. The Langevin equation exhibits the backreaction and the fluctuation-dissipation relation of the trapping. The fluctuation is induced by a multiplicative colored noise that can be identified as the the particle number density fluctuations and the dissipation is a new effect that {{may play a role in}} the trapping with a strong coupling. In the weak coupling regime, we calculate the power spectrum of the noise-driven inflaton fluctuations for a single <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> and studied its variation with the trapping location. We also consider a case with closely spaced <b>trapping</b> <b>points</b> and find that the resulting power spectrum is blue. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
30|$|Two {{community}} diversity statistics (species {{richness and}} the Shannon-Wiener Index (H’)) were calculated at two scales based on <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> totals nested within units (alpha diversity) {{and for each}} experimental unit (beta diversity). The effect of treatment on alpha diversity measures was evaluated using a nested ANOVA (<b>trapping</b> <b>points</b> as subsamples within units). Treatment effects on beta diversity were analyzed as a completely randomized design with ANOVA. Comparisons among treatment and control means of species richness and H’ at both diversity scales were made using Tukey’s HSD.|$|R
40|$|Billiard trajectories (broken {{generalised}} geodesics) {{are considered}} in the exterior of an obstacle $K$ with smooth boundary on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold. We prove a generalisation of the well-known Santalo's formula. As a consequence, it is established that if the set of <b>trapped</b> <b>points</b> has positive measure, then for all sufficiently small smooth perturbations of the boundary of $K$ the set of <b>trapped</b> <b>points</b> for the new obstacle obtained in this way also has positive measure. More generally {{the measure of the}} set of <b>trapped</b> <b>points</b> depends continuously on perturbations of the obstacle $K$. Some consequences of the generalised Santalo's formula are derived in the case of scattering by an obstacle $K$ in an Euclidean space. For example, it is shown that, for a large class of obstacles $K$, the volume of $K$ is uniquely determined by the average travelling times of scattering rays in the exterior of $K$...|$|R

This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed.

40|$|A novel {{mechanism}} for the transport of microscale particles in viscous fluids is demonstrated. The mechanism exploits the trapping of such particles by rotational streaming cells established {{in the vicinity of}} an oscillating cylinder, recently analyzed in previous work. The present work explores a strategy of transporting particles between the <b>trapping</b> <b>points</b> established by multiple cylinders undergoing oscillations in sequential intervals. It is demonstrated that, by controlling the sequence of oscillation intervals, an inertial particle is effectively and predictably transported between the stable <b>trapping</b> <b>points.</b> Arrays of cylinders in various arrangements are investigated, revealing a quite general technique for constructing arbitrary particle trajectories. The timescales for transport are also discussed. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures. Under review in Appl. Phys. Let...|$|R
25|$|The hazard of {{the short}} section of single line with the single lead {{junction}} would be reduced if there were two red signals protecting it. British practice mostly has one protecting signal. New South Wales practice mostly has two red signals protecting such a junction, albeit {{at the cost of}} some reduction in train headway. Alternatively, <b>trap</b> <b>points</b> could be installed to protect the single line. Two signal protection is a relatively easy way to reduce these risks, and would have been helpful at the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. A comprehensive ATP system would also help.|$|E

40|$|Our model {{consists}} of a Brownian particle X moving in R, where a Poissonian field of moving traps is present. Each trap is a ball with constant radius, centered at a <b>trap</b> <b>point,</b> and each <b>trap</b> <b>point</b> moves under a Brownian motion independently of others and of the motion of X. Here, we investigate the 'speed' of X on the time interval [0,t] and on 'microscopic' time scales given that X avoids the trap field up to time t. Firstly, following the earlier work of Athreya et al. [Math. Phys. Anal. Geom. 20 : 1 (2017) ], we obtain bounds on the maximal displacement of X from the origin. Our upper bound is an improvement of the corresponding bound therein. Then, we prove a result showing how the speed on microscopic time scales affect the overall macroscopic subdiffusivity on [0,t]. Finally, we show that X moves subdiffusively even on certain microscopic time scales, in the bulk of [0,t]. The results are stated so that each gives an 'optimal survival strategy' for the system. We conclude by giving several related open problems...|$|R

40|$|JMP {{was funded}} by Disney's Animal Programs, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and University of St Andrews. The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) is an {{endangered}} rodent with a restricted geographic range and small population size. Establishing an efficient monitoring program of its abundance has been problematic; previous trapping designs have not worked well because the species is sparsely distributed. We compared Key Largo woodrat abundance estimates in Key Largo, Florida, USA, obtained using <b>trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects (TPT) and spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) based on statistical properties, survey effort, practicality, and cost. Both methods combine aspects of distance sampling with capture–recapture, but TPT relies on radiotracking individuals to estimate detectability and SECR relies on repeat capture information to estimate densities of home ranges. Abundance estimates using TPT {{in the spring of}} 2007 and 2008 were 333 woodrats (CV[*]=[*] 0. 46) and 696 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 43), respectively. Abundance estimates using SECR in the spring, summer, and winter of 2007 were 97 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 31), 334 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 26), and 433 (CV[*]=[*] 0. 20) animals, respectively. <b>Trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects used approximately 960 person-hours and 1, 010 [*]trap-nights/season. Spatially explicit capture–recapture used approximately 500 [*]person-hours and 6, 468 [*]trap-nights/season. Significant time was saved in the SECR survey by setting large numbers of traps close together, minimizing time walking between <b>traps.</b> <b>Trapping</b> <b>point</b> transects were practical to implement in the field, and valuable auxiliary information on Key Largo woodrat behavior was obtained via radiocollaring. In this particular study, detectability of the woodrat using TPT was very low and consequently the SECR method was more efficient. Both methods require a substantial investment in survey effort to detect any change in abundance because of large uncertainty in estimates. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
