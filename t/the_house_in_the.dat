5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E
5|$|Henry Strachey, the {{grandson}} of the geologist and a senior civil servant, was created a baronet in 1801. When he inherited <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century {{the house had been}} mortgaged, however the mortgage was paid by Strachey's employer Clive of India.|$|E

5|$|Shaw had {{prepared}} preliminary designs of Woodland House by August 1875, and building began early in 1876, with construction being undertaken by W. H. Lascelles. The initial {{cost of building}} the house was £4,500. Fildes and his family moved into <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Autumn of 1877. Fildes house was larger than Marcus Stone's, and costlier to build. Shortly after Fildes had commissioned Shaw to design his house, Fildes' grandmother, Mary, had died, leaving him her property.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage leased <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1915, {{and made}} the {{building}} its headquarters for two years. The group rented the house in order to emphasize their importance {{in the fight for}} women's suffrage.|$|E

When Alison asks what he did with Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse is wrapped in the trunk of their car.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the 2008 campaign, Hunter had served in Congress since 1981; {{representing}} California's 42nd (1981–83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for the construction of an additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 mid-term election.|$|E
5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E

5|$|Both of {{the country}} club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were {{constructed}} along with <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea in materials and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable roofs and a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have stone and brick pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower-level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved stone and ironwork.|$|E
5|$|José Antonio Estudillo died in 1852, and {{his family}} stayed until 1887, when they moved to Los Angeles, leaving <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of a caretaker. Meanwhile, the 1884 {{publication}} of Ramona, a novel set in Southern California which painted a romanticized portrait of Californio life, generated a nationwide interest in the region. This, combined {{with the opening of}} the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railway lines (and the ensuing rate war, which drove prices down to as low as $1 from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles), meant that hordes of tourists made their way to Southern California to see the locations in the novel. Unfortunately, Jackson died in 1885 without ever having disclosed what the actual locations in the novel were, which caused a great deal of speculation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from {{inside one of the}} houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next election.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The de Clevedon family line {{ended in}} 1376, and the manor {{eventually}} passed, by marriage, to the Northamptonshire family of Wake, who were Lords of the Manor until 1630. John Wake made major additions to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 16th century, {{including a new}} west wing. The manor was sold by Sir John Wake to Sir John Digby in 1630. Digby's estates were confiscated during the English Civil War, but were recovered after the Restoration by his heir. In 1709 the house was bought by Abraham Elton, a merchant from Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} also {{close to the}} {{original}} entrance gate to Sloatsburg's Cappamore Farm. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby mountainside was built around 1900 as an estate for Nicholas T. Brown, a local alderman from Paterson, New Jersey. This estate and farm gave {{a panoramic view of}} the countryside around Sloatsburg. The house was demolished during the construction of the New York State Thruway in 1956. The steel bridge over the Ramapo River and the wooden bridge over Sloat's Millrace were removed as they had become hazardous. Today, all that remains are the stone pillar entranceway, and a walking trail to the nearby Sloat's Dam. The gateposts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the remaining mill and dam structures since they used the same stonework.|$|E
