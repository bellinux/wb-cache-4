Meanwhile, Bart befriends the now jobless Principal Skinner, as <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> about anecdotes of Ned's failure that Bart relates. Feeling lonely, Principal Skinner eventually decides to re-enlist in the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. <b>They</b> <b>laugh</b> loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
25|$|Back in town, at {{the local}} tavern, Gaston sulks at his loss of a bride. LeFou and the patrons attempt to cheer him up ("Gaston"), when Maurice rushes in {{claiming}} a Beast has Belle locked away, <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> at him but Gaston formulates a plan ("Gaston (Reprise)"). Back at the castle, the Beast grows impatient as Belle has yet to join him for dinner. Cogsworth informs him she refuses to come, after a shouting match between Belle and the Beast (which ends in a victory for Belle) he tells her if she cannot eat with him then she will not eat at all. In his quarters, he sulks and notes his fate should the spell not break ("How Long Must This Go On?"). Eventually, Belle does become hungry and ventures into the kitchen where the servants offer her dinner despite their master's orders. They treat her to an amazing cabaret show ("Be Our Guest").|$|E
6000|$|The two {{partners}} {{looked at each}} other, and then, to Barker's infinite perplexity, the same extraordinary convulsion that had seized Miss Kitty fell upon them. <b>They</b> <b>laughed,</b> holding on each other's shoulders; <b>they</b> <b>laughed,</b> clinging to Barker's struggling figure; {{they went out and}} laughed with their backs against a tree. <b>They</b> <b>laughed</b> separately and in different corners. And then they came up to Barker with tears in their eyes, dropped their heads on his shoulder, and murmured exhaustedly: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was their}} turn to laugh, now, {{at the notion of}} his shaking Scrooge. But, being {{thoroughly}} good-natured, and not much caring what <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at, so that <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.|$|R
60|$|The poem closed there, and the providential {{appearance}} of their donkeys gave the ladies {{an excuse for}} retiring to their room, where <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> till <b>they</b> could <b>laugh</b> no more.|$|R
500|$|Horse symbols {{permeate}} the text. [...] Rennie, an accomplished rider, {{and her husband}} whip their heads back and forth horse-like when <b>they</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] Joe is fond of the epithet horseshit when pointing out nonsense. [...] His surname, Morgan, {{is the name of}} an American breed of horse. [...] Joe's consistent sureness, his [...] "rationality and absence of 'craft or guile'", according to Thomas Schaub, seem to echo the Houyhnhnms, the race of rational horses in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.|$|E
500|$|Later, Scully {{is sitting}} by Mulder's bedside when he regains consciousness. He stares blankly at Scully, and asks [...] "Who are you?" [...] At first, Scully thinks that Mulder does not {{remember}} her. However, she quickly {{realizes that he}} is actually playing a practical joke. <b>They</b> <b>laugh,</b> and Mulder asks, [...] "Did anybody miss me?" [...] Scully responds with tears. Later at the FBI, Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder's case and rescinds his offer to promote him. He indicates that {{he will continue to}} work on The X-Files with Scully and Mulder.|$|E
500|$|Rand {{scholars}} Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while {{stressing the}} importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as [...] "literary, hyperbolic and emotional". Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite [...] "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rand's ethics are [...] "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful {{than any other in}} contemporary thought". In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that [...] "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation". In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, [...] "I know <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.|$|E

2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>laugh</b> as if {{they mean}} it. They are not mean. This attracts amiable {{listeners}} [...] How cheering to have some signals from a radio world beyond celebs, Olympics and the new football season.' – Gillian Reynolds, The Daily Telegraph ...|$|E
2500|$|The age of {{an adult}} human is {{commonly}} measured in whole years since the day of birth. Fractional years, months or even weeks {{may be used to}} describe the age of children and infants for finer resolution. The time of day the birth occurred is not commonly considered. In some cultures {{there are other ways to}} express age. For example, some cultures measure age by counting years including the current year, while others count years without including it. It could be said for the same person that he is twenty years old or that he is in the twenty-first year of his life. In Russian the former expression is generally used, the latter one has restricted usage: it is used for age of a deceased person in obituaries and for the age {{of an adult}} when it is desired to show him/her older than he/she is. (Psychologically, a woman in her 20th year seems older than one who is 19 years old.) [...] Other cultures that express age differently may not use years elapsed since birth at all. [...] Inuit culture is an example in which birthdays are not celebrated because maturity is not signified in terms of years. [...] The Navajo culture is another in which age is not counted through years elapsed from birth. [...] In this case, age is measured through certain milestones in a person's life, such as the first time <b>they</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The European {{roots of}} the {{community}} are predominantly from small German states which are comprised by the Germany of today and from the region known as Montbéliard in eastern France. [...] Waterloo Settlement's first settlers were {{sons and daughters of}} second and third-generation German and Montbéliardian immigrants brought to Nova Scotia as loyal citizens to the British crown in 1750–52. The French-speaking Montbéliardians were considered good candidates to emigrate since they were known to be [...] "very frugal, as well as strong independent laborers" [...] (Withrow, 2002). [...] As for the Germans (and likely the Swiss), Judge Debrisay quotes a number of stereotypes and impressions that developed and existed of the first German immigrants up to 1895, at least 140 years after their arrival. [...] "They are a big, square-shouldered, deep-chested race. [...] They do not talk much, but look as though they thought—easy going, and good tempered... they are hearty eaters, but they are not fussy and finikin over their food... so long as the dish is wholesome, and there is sufficient of it, they are satisfied... in the sensuous arts of painting and sculpture, the Germans are poor. [...] In the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great, and this fact provides a key to their character. [...] They are simple, earnest, homely, genuine people. [...] They do not laugh much, but when they do <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> deep down. [...] They are slow, but so is a deep river... The Germans believe in themselves, and respect themselves".|$|E

His face is {{bleeding}} and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> again. They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, {{and up to the}} prison; all the village sees the prison gate open {{in the darkness of the}} night, and swallow him--like this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{begin by}} clodding him; and <b>they</b> <b>laugh</b> {{themselves}} to pieces {{to see him}} try to dodge one clod and get hit with another?" ...|$|E

60|$|People who {{consider}} themselves Gods, as the Children of the Zodiac did, {{find it hard}} to laugh, because the Immortals know nothing worth laughter or tears. Leo rose up with a very heavy heart, and he and the girl together went to and fro among men; their new fear of death behind them. First <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at a naked baby attempting to thrust its fat toes into its foolish pink mouth; next <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at a kitten chasing her own tail; and then <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at a boy trying to steal a kiss from a girl, and getting his ears boxed. Lastly, <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> because the wind blew in their faces as they ran down a hill-side together, and broke panting and breathless into a knot of villagers at the bottom. The villagers laughed, too, at their flying clothes and wind-reddened faces; and in the evening gave them food and invited them to a dance on the grass, where everybody laughed through the mere joy of being able to dance.|$|R
