2500|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost {{the spirit of}} their forefathers, copying each other in design and sound, becoming all the same. As far back as 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands [...] "after X" [...] makeup and outrageous looks became [...] "more important than music". Several older musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said [...] "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way {{because they want to}} be visual kei or look visual kei. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> to look like others instead of doing it to look different.

2500|$|After {{absorbing}} all {{the souls}} from Purgatory and declaring himself God, Castiel goes forth to punish all the wrongdoers in the world. Very quickly, though, he discovers that he absorbed the Leviathans, who {{are attempting to}} break free of his vessel. Sam and Dean manage to return most of the souls to Purgatory but fail to return the Leviathans, who seemingly kill Castiel before vanishing. The Leviathans inhabit the bodies of many different people around the world. Sam and Dean learn that their weakness is Sodium Borate (aka Borax), though it has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of a facility they are building, {{only to discover that}} it is a facility to cure cancer. As one Leviathan states, [...] "We're only here to help". The spirit of Bobby later confirms that while they are curing disease, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as part of their grand plan to turn humanity into the perfect food source. With the help of Castiel, and Kevin, a prophet of the lord, the brothers learn {{that the only way to}} kill the Leviathans is with the [...] "bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen" [...] and set out to find the three bloods. Kevin can read the word of God and helps Sam and Dean decipher the word to stop the Leviathans. Eventually, Dean and Castiel kill Dick but are dragged into Purgatory as a result, while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are disorganized.|$|E

Then he had to climb the fence and chase his hat through the garden. They would let him almost {{get his hands on}} it and then, just as he thought that he surely had it, they would snatch it away.

60|$|It {{was almost}} a relief to turn back to that other outlook and watch the village life that was now {{beginning}} to wake in earnest. The procession of water-fetchers had formed itself in a long chattering line that stretched river-wards.

These companions, these Seyffert women and so forth, were all very well in their way; there wasn't much they kept from you if you got them cornered and asked them intently.

[...] "V.V., I'm going to make a man of you," [...] the phrase ran through his brain. The deep instinctive jealousy of the primordial father was still strong in old Grammont's blood.

60|$|I {{was ashamed}} of him. And yet that was not fair, for {{how could he be}} {{expected}} to know this marvelous child in these few weeks, when we who thought we had known her all her life were daily seeing the clouds uncover some new altitudes of her character whose existence was not suspected by us before? But we are all that way: when we know a thing we have only scorn for other people who don't happen to know it. And I {{was ashamed of}} these courtiers, too, for the way they licked their chops, so to speak, as envying Joan her great chance, they not knowing her any better than the King did. A blush began to rise in Joan's cheeks at the thought that she was working for her country for pay, and she dropped her head and tried to hide her face, as girls always do when they find themselves blushing; no one knows why they do, but they do, and the more they blush the more they fail to get reconciled to it, and the more they can't bear to have people look at them when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> The King made it a great deal worse by calling attention to it, which is the unkindest thing a person can do when a girl is blushing; sometimes, when there is a big crowd of strangers, it is even likely to make her cry if she is as young as Joan was. God knows the reason for this, it is hidden from men. As for me, I would as soon blush as sneeze; in fact, I would rather. However, these meditations are not of consequence: I will go on with what I was saying. The King rallied her for blushing, and this brought {{up the rest of the}} blood and turned her face to fire. Then he was sorry, seeing what he had done, and tried to make her comfortable by saying the blush was exceeding becoming to her and not to mind itwhich caused even the dog to notice it now, so of course the red in Joan's face turned to purple, and the tears overflowed and ran downI could have told anybody that that would happen. The King was distressed, and saw that the best thing to do would be to get away from this subject, so he began to say the finest kind of things about Joan's capture of the Tourelles, and presently when she was more composed he mentioned the reward again and pressed her to name it. Everybody listened with anxious interest to hear what her claim was going to be, but when her answer came their faces showed that the thing she asked for was not what they had been expecting.|$|E
