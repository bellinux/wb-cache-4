5|$|Both Mulder and Joan follow Jeraldine to Hong Kong, where Mulder {{learns that}} she is a {{middleman}} selling government secrets. Mulder tracks down Jeraldine and handcuffs himself to her. Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the digital tape. Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming down the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks down <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> encounters the men, creating a flash that causes them all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E

5|$|Chadderton Hall Park is {{a public}} park by the River Irk {{in the north of}} Chadderton, {{spanning}} an area of over , in what were once the gardens of the manorial Chadderton Hall. At the end of the 19th century they were leased to Joseph Ball, who transformed <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> grounds into a pleasure garden, complete with a boating lake and a menagerie. The hall was demolished in 1939. The park is now owned by Oldham Council, the local authority, and was opened to the public in 1956. It was awarded Green Flag status in 2006.|$|E
5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Association {{would set}} up a {{charitable}} fund {{for the use of}} Manor Hall and its residents. The aim of this fund being to provide financial support to either the Hall or any of its student run committees. The fund is operated on an application basis with the Association reviewing legitimate applications for finance from those currently involved {{in the life of the}} Hall for the acquisition of assets that will provide some tangible benefit to <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>and</b> future generations of students who reside there. Fundraising activities are conducted throughout the year, usually in the form of prize raffles at hall events.|$|E

5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, the Earl of Craven. This was a {{deliberate}} attempt at conserving the existing building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund asks Odin why {{he would}} expect Eric {{more than any other}} king, to which Odin {{responds}} that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.|$|E
5|$|The King's Champion {{would then}} throw down the gauntlet; the {{ceremony}} would be repeated at {{the centre of}} <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> at the High Table (where the sovereign would be seated). The sovereign would then drink to the champion from a gold cup, which he would then present to the latter. This ritual was dropped from the coronation of Queen Victoria and was never revived. The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms. The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new front wall in the 16th century. The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} Grade II* listed, and is {{surrounded}} by parkland and formal gardens, which are included as GradeII on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. On the site are a grotto, an ice house, and an ornamental obelisk, all Grade II listed structures. Rode Hall is still owned and occupied by the Wilbrahams, currently by the 8th Baronet, Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham, and his wife, Lady Anne Baker Wilbraham. <b>The</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> gardens {{are open to the}} public from April to September.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} laid out around a large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room to the right of <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> the buttery and kitchen to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E

The stables quadrangle is contemporary with <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> is listed at grade II*.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

5|$|When Newark, New Jersey, {{hosted the}} 21st National Sängerfest, held on 1–4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 {{people showed up}} to hear the music, many {{arriving}} on chartered trains.

Five thousand singers from more than a hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel.|$|E
5|$|When in 1415 Sir Piers Legh II {{was wounded}} in the Battle of Agincourt, his mastiff stood over and {{protected}} him for many hours through the battle. The mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. They were bred at <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> kept separate from other strains, figuring prominently in founding the modern breed. The strain died out around the beginning of the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
