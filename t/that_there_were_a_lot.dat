500|$|Of the album's {{personal}} nature, Bono said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of [...] "blood and guts" [...] in it. His {{lyrics to}} the ballad [...] "One" [...] {{were inspired by}} the band members' struggling relationships and the German reunification. The Edge described the song on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". Similarly, [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] describes a strained relationship and unease over obligations, and on [...] "Acrobat", Bono sings about weakness, hypocrisy, and inadequacy. The torch songs of Roy Orbison, Scott Walker, and Jacques Brel were major influences, evidenced by tracks such as: [...] "Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses", {{a description of a}} couple's argument; [...] "So Cruel", about unrequited love, obsession, and possessiveness; and the closing track, [...] "Love Is Blindness", a bleak account of a failing romance.|$|E

Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in Greenwich Village in 1953 called [...] "Make it New", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front. Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used {{as a vehicle for}} his tracts about economic reform. Wilhelm writes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer Guy Davenport, but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out and delayed his release from St Elizabeths.|$|E

The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75%. We could have made the system so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, but we wanted to make each upgrade feel like this giant thing.

In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script made me laugh out loud when I read it. [...] I also like the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're {{not going to be}} restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.'

The song was digitally released on August 9, 2011 exclusively on the iTunes Store, and to all other digital retailers on August 16. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on August 21, and a CD single of the song was released on September 9, 2011 in Germany. The band revealed during an interview <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of songs they were planning to release as the album's first single, but it was a [...] "natural choice" [...] to release [...] "What You Want". To promote the single, the band partnered with SoundTracking and GetGlue.

6000|$|Mr. Dosson that afternoon, {{sitting by}} his younger daughter's bedside, read the dreadful [...] "piece" [...] out to both his {{children}} from the copy of the Reverberator he had secured on the boulevard. It is a remarkable fact that as a family they were rather disappointed in this composition, in which their curiosity found less to repay it than it had expected, their resentment against Mr. Flack less to stimulate it, their fluttering effort to take {{the point of view}} of the Proberts less to sustain it, and their acceptance of the promulgation of Francie's innocent remarks as a natural incident of the life of the day less to make them reconsider it. The letter from Paris appeared lively, [...] "chatty," [...] highly calculated to please, and so far as the personalities contained in it were concerned Mr. Dosson wanted to know if they weren't aware over here of the charges brought every day against the most prominent men in Boston. [...] "If there was anything in that style they might talk," [...] he said; and he scanned the effusion afresh with a certain surprise at not finding in it some imputation of pecuniary malversation. The effect of an acquaintance with the text was to depress Delia, who didn't exactly see what there was in it to take back or explain away. However, she was aware there were some points they didn't understand, and doubtless these were the scandalous places--the things that had so worked up the Proberts. But why should they have minded if other people didn't understand the allusions (these were peculiar, but peculiarly incomprehensible) any better than she did? The whole thing struck Francie herself as infinitely less lurid than Mme. de Brecourt's account of it, and the part about her own situation and her beautiful picture seemed to make even less of the subject than it easily might have done. It was scanty, it was [...] "skimpy," [...] and if Mr. Waterlow was offended it wouldn't be because they had published too much about him. It was nevertheless clear to her <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things SHE hadn't told Mr. Flack, as well as a great many she had: perhaps those were the things that lady had put in--Florine or Dorine--the one she had mentioned at Mme. de Brecourt's.|$|E
