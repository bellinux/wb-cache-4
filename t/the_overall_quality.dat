The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music sequencer program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking {{only a few minutes}} to complete, compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero.|$|E

A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>quality</b> of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

The Windows 10 version was criticized for its technical issues. As a result, the game was released for Steam on 29 September 2016.

25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review {{published by the}} Cochrane Collaboration, compared Rifamycins (monotheraphy and combination therapy) to INH monotheraphy as an alternative in preventing active TB in HIV negative populations.

However, <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>quality</b> of evidence as per GRADE criteria was low to moderate. Another meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion, namely that rifamycin-containing regimens taken for 3 months or longer had a better profile in preventing TB reactivation.|$|E

The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated cities. There is no consistent evidence that crime rates rise when standards for hiring women are changed, and this raises questions about whether norming tests or altering their content to create equal pass rates is preferable. The paper examines how the changing composition of police departments affects such measures as the murder of and assaults against police officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} on human translators {{to enhance the}} quality of the translation is not free of problems. Besides syntactic and semantic factors there are factors of style and aesthetics of the target language. While many so-called professional translators could produce comprehensible text of higher quality than machine translation, the quality of the text in the target language is difficult to assess. Awkward or unfluent texts, when admitted in the system, may establish norms and frame of reference that don't serve the purpose of enhancing <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>quality</b> of translation, and an example for translators, or aspiring translators to imitate. This, however, is arguably outside of the scope of the project.|$|E
