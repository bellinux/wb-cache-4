By synthesising interlocked analogues of previously studied porphyrin–corrole conjugates, we demonstrate that this approach gives access to rotaxanes in which the detailed electronic properties of the axle component are unchanged but whose steric properties are transformed by the mechanical “picket fence” provided by the <b>threaded</b> <b>rings.</b> Our results suggest that interlocked functionalised porphyrins, readily available using the AT-CuAAC approach, are sterically hindered scaffolds for the development of new catalysts and materials...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two most}} {{commonly}} used methods for calibration of <b>thread</b> <b>rings,</b> with different measuring uncertainty. The method of mechanical sensing with two balls is mostly used on one-axial measuring machines and on coordinate measuring machines. However, the method of calculating the core diameter of the <b>thread</b> <b>ring</b> combined with the technique of adaptation (in accordance with the method of the smallest squares) is used on the profile scanner. The required tolerances, which are very narrow for adjustable and laboratory <b>thread</b> <b>ring,</b> so the measuring uncertainty may be too high when using the method of mechanical sensing with two balls, and the low quality of some control rings, are the decisive factors for choosing an appropriate method in the industry.

5000|$|In [...] "template {{threading}} approach", {{unlike the}} statistical approach, {{the interactions between}} rings and strings need to be attractive, such as metal chelations or charge transfer interactions which have been mentioned in the synthesis route 1. Because of this, the equilibrium is enthalpically driven, where the enthalpy is negative. In this method, high numbers of <b>threading</b> <b>rings</b> can be achieved, thus it is a useful way to stoichiometrically control the rings ratio of polyrotaxanes.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{approach}} is the simplest method to synthesize polyrotaxanes. Through mixing the main chain polymers and the rings in the solution, polyrotaxanes can be obtained after adding bulky stoppers to prevent the rings from dethreading from the chains. The number of rings on each chain depends on the threading equilibrium. Kinetic limitations due to the low concentration of chain ends and entropic effects also need further consideration. To overcome these obstacles, template threading (see below) is also a feasible alternative that can improve dynamically the number of <b>threading</b> <b>rings</b> by changing the equilibrium constant.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} and interaction of coaxial vortex rings in the FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable medium. We find that <b>threading</b> vortex <b>rings</b> with a vortex string results in significant qualitative {{differences in their}} evolution and interaction. In particular, threading prevents the annihilation of rings in a head-on collision, allows generic ring overtaking, and can even reverse the direction of motion of a ring. We identify that an important mechanism for producing this new behaviour is that <b>threaded</b> vortex <b>rings</b> interact indirectly via induced twisting of the threading vortex string.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a [2]catenane with 87 -membered rings was improved and extended to [2]catenanes with 63 - and 147 -membered rings. One {{of the key}} features is the carbonate linkage between phenols with tolane substituents in the 2 -and 6 -positions, {{which serves as a}} covalent template for the geometrical arrangement of a macrocycle and a ring precursor. Subsequent cyclization of the <b>threaded</b> <b>ring</b> precursor gives the precatenane as the main product, and this is converted into the catenane by carbonate hydrolysis. As well as the precatenane, its dumbbell shaped isomer is formed in the cyclization step. From the known conformation of the templating carbonate moiety and the strong dependence of the ratio of precatenane and dumbbell on the ring size, the dumbbell's origin is attributed to the conformational flexibility of the large rings and not to geometrical ambiguity of the carbonate moiety.

40|$|Absence of {{localization}} {{is demonstrated}} analytically to leading order in weak disorder in a one-dimensional Anderson {{model of a}} <b>ring</b> <b>threaded</b> by an Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) flux.

The absence of localization in the <b>ring</b> <b>threaded</b> by an A-B flux for sufficiently weak disorder is compatible with large free electron type persistent current obtained in recent studies of the above model...|$|R
50|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in rapid tuning came around 1815 when Johann Stumpff, a musician and inventor from Amsterdam invented {{a way for}} a drum's pitch to be changed by physically rotating the instrument. Similar to Cramer's design, rods attached the counter hoop to a metal ring below the bowl. Unlike Cramer's design, Stumpff added a second metal ring that {{was attached to the}} legs supporting the kettle. The bottom <b>ring</b> was <b>threaded</b> and a long bolt extended {{from the base of the}} drum up through the <b>threaded</b> <b>ring</b> and attached to the second ring. As the bowl and counter hoop rotated, the counter hoop would move up and down but the bowl would remain stationary. This allowed for different levels of tension to be placed on the counter hoop and, as a result, produced different pitches. This invention was popular because it was cheap to manufacture, worked well, and was easy to transport, which made these drums ideal for traveling orchestras. However, the fact that players had to put down the mallets before rotating the drums was a major drawback.|$|R

In both, the equations are solved numerically on discitized lattice and the nonlinearity and the self-consistency are fully taken into account. First, we study the superconducting states on the Möbius strip {{in the presence of}} the Aharonov-Bohm flux <b>threading</b> the <b>ring</b> by employing the Ginzburg-Landau theory, and confirm the phase diagram previously proposed by Hayashi and Ebisawa [J.

The metastable states as well as the equilibrium energy state are studied and the nonequiriblium processes when the magnetic field is varied at a fixed temperature are discussed. Next, we study the microscopic superconducting states on the Möbius strip based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, especially focusing on the state with a real-space node in the superconducting gap, which is expected to appear when the flux <b>threading</b> the <b>ring</b> is half the superconducting flux quantum.
