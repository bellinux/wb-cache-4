500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] {{were said to}} have a {{universal}} appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an [...] "everyman breeziness" [...] because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: [...] "a loping, sunny tune <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> has the opposite sentiment of its title". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a [...] "reassuring, comforting" [...] tone, Powter said the song [...] "mak fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe". He also affirmed: [...] "It's not literally about having a bad day, it's more about not taking yourself too seriously and complaining about trivial things".|$|E

5000|$|In a nutshell, Domestic Noir {{takes place}} {{primarily}} in homes and workplaces, concerns itself largely (but not exclusively) {{with the female}} experience, is based around relationships and takes as its base a broadly feminist view that the domestic sphere is a challenging and sometimes dangerous prospect for its inhabitants. <b>Thatâ€™s</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all of my work described there.|$|R
500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> lets you draw your own conclusions [...] or keep the ones you have already reached." [...] A reviewer in [...] stated he was [...] "enthusiastic about this book", praising the [...] "personal quality [...] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed."

500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way it all works {{together}} in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although Worley {{maintained}} that [...] "there {{is a connection}} there" [...] between Iraq and al-Qaeda, he denied that the song endorsed the war in Iraq and suggested that the lyrics should be taken at face value: [...] "The song is posing a question: Have you forgotten what happened to our country on 9/11? <b>That's</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the size of it." ...|$|R

2500|$|DeRogatis {{compared}} the album's repeated listening value to a heightened psychedelic awareness, that its melodies [...] "continue to reveal themselves after dozens of listens, just as previously unnoticed {{corners of the}} world reveal themselves during the psychedelic experience". On the subject of psychedelic records in the 1960s, Sean Lennon stated that [...] "psychedelic music is a term <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> refers to these sort of epic, ambitious long-form records... the reason Pet Sounds is considered a psychedelic journey or whatever is because it's like opening a door and stepping through and entering another world and you're in that other world {{for a period of time}} and then you come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|We all enjoyed ourselves--I think I {{can safely}} say that, {{but it was}} in a rather quiet way. We very, very seldom played the piano; we played the flute and the {{clarinet}} together, and made good music, too, what there was of it, but we always played the same old tune; it was a very pretty tune --how well I remember it--I wonder when I shall ever get rid of it. We never played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotions--but I am too fast: young Albert did know part of a tune something about [...] "O Something-Or-Other How Sweet It Is to Know That He's His What's-his-Name" [...] (I do not remember the exact title of it, but it was very plaintive and full of sentiment); Albert played <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all the time until we contracted with him to restrain himself. But nobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck, and the congregational singing at church and prayers was not of a superior order of architecture. I put up with it as long as I could and then joined in and tried to improve it, but this encouraged young George to join in too, and that made a failure of it; because George's voice was just [...] "turning," [...] and when he was singing a dismal sort of bass it was apt to fly off the handle and startle everybody with a most discordant cackle on the upper notes. George didn't know the tunes, either, which was also a drawback to his performances. I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|On various {{accounts}} it will behoove {{us to look}} a {{good deal}} more strictly into this Voltaire; and, as his relations to Friedrich and to the world are so multiplex, endeavor to disengage the real likeness of the man from the circumambient noise and confusion which in his instance continue very great. [...] "Voltaire was the spiritual complement of Friedrich," [...] says Sauerteig once: [...] "what little of lasting their poor Century produced lies mainly in these Two. A very somnambulating Century! But what little it DID, we must call Friedrich; what little it THOUGHT, Voltaire. Other fruit we have not from it to speak of, at this day. Voltaire, and what CAN be faithfully done on the Voltaire Creed; 'Realized Voltairism;'--admit it, reader, not in a too triumphant humor,--is not <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the net historical product of the Eighteenth Century? The rest of its history either pure somnambulism; or a mere Controversy, to the effect, 'Realized Voltairism? How soon shall it be realized, then? Not at once, surely!' So that Friedrich and Voltaire are related, not by accident only. They are, they for want of better, the two Original Men of their Century; the chief and in a sense the sole products of their Century. They alone remain to us as still living results from it,--such as they are. And the rest, truly, OUGHT to depart and vanish (as they are now doing); being mere ephemera; contemporary eaters, scramblers for provender, talkers of acceptable hearsay; and related merely to the butteries and wiggeries of their time, and not related to the Perennialities at all, as these Two were."--With more of the like sort from Sauerteig.|$|E
