5|$|The first Springbok colours {{were created}} in 1906 during the 1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been {{provided}} for them and the captain Paul Roos decided that the team need {{to create their own}} emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold piping and a Springbok emblem on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> would be made for the team in Richmond. Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time. Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.|$|E
5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6.

25|$|The Pockets: {{the pockets}} of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> is called “a barchetta”, which means “little boat”, due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it {{the shape of a}} stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name “a pignata”. Neither of these {{features}} have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed look of a jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand finished stitching runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this rocky start, CAP became an {{official}} [...] "hearts and minds" [...] civic action program, and a school of sorts was eventually established near Da Nang. Training was brief (ten days) and covered a few bare essentials – some Vietnamese phrases, customs, and culture, some civic action precepts, and some military topics – far too short to be of much real good, though {{a step in the}} right direction. Upon graduation, you were posted to your unit. Eventually they began issuing certificates showing you had graduated. Initially, CAP Marines were issued a special cloth and leather insignia to be worn from the button on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket</b> of the uniform jacket. These were later replaced by handsome enameled metal pins, also made to be worn on <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>pocket.</b> These, however, were easily lost, and also made a good aiming point for the enemy. They were usually dispensed with on patrols.|$|E
