5|$|Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Norfolk Regiment, {{had become}} {{isolated}} from their regiment. They occupied and defended a farmhouse against {{an attack by}} Waffen-SS forces {{in the village of}} Le Paradis. After running out of ammunition, the defenders surrendered to the German troops. The Germans led them across the road <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> and machine-gunned them. Ninety-seven British troops died. Two survived, with injuries, and hid until they were captured by German forces several days later.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> of Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} gatehouse, which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south gatehouse has two drum towers {{on either side of}} a gateway, protected by a portcullis, and would have had three floors, linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> walk around the castle. It would originally have been faced with dressed stonework, which has since been removed. The north gatehouse on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The first floor of the building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E

5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|After a few {{setbacks}} Max and Steph finally tie {{the knot}} {{in a ceremony}} initiated by Kieron Hobbs (Jake Hendriks). After the ceremony Max and O.B. leave everyone to enjoy the party while they slip away with Tom. When they are alone Max gives O.B. an engraved watch to say thanks for being his best man and his best mate, but when Niall drives away at speed he doesn't see Tom {{in the way of}} the car and Max jumps out in front of him to grab Tom, Niall did not put the brakes and carried on and crashed in <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> after running over Max. O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom. Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz and his {{men were}} {{questioned}} by a French captain and accused of being spies and saboteurs. They {{were taken to the}} prison at Châlons the next day where they were separated. Strachwitz, as an officer, was placed in solitary confinement. Early in the morning they were all lined up for the firing squad, but a French captain arrived just in time to stop the execution. Strachwitz {{and his men}} were then tried before a French military court on 14 October 1914. The court sentenced them all to five years of forced labour on the prison island of Cayenne. At the same time they were deprived of rank, thus losing the status of prisoners of war. Strachwitz was then taken to the prisons at Lyon and Montpellier, and then to the Île de Ré, from where the prison ship would depart for Cayenne. It is unclear what circumstances prevented his departure, but he was imprisoned at Riom and Avignon instead. At Avignon prison he was physically and mentally tortured by both the guards and the other prisoners. This included being chained naked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> deprivation of food and severe beatings. After one year at Avignon he was given a German uniform and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Barraux.|$|E
