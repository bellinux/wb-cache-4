5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen their position in <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E

5|$|Although Watership Down is a {{peaceful}} habitat, Hazel realizes {{there are no}} does (female rabbits), thus making {{the future of the}} warren certain to end with <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> death of the rabbits present. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request for does.|$|E

5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to <b>the</b> <b>inevitable.</b> On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Tătărescu became {{involved}} in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Beneš, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England. Beneš, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of Tătărescu's designs.|$|E
5|$|Less {{successful}} at first were {{the efforts of}} the American battleships to match their British counterparts in excellence of gunnery. Having provided numerous veteran gun-crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in the previous months, the gunnery complements of Division Nine were badly depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits. <b>The</b> <b>inevitable</b> effect of this loss of talent became apparent when, on 17 December 1917, Battleship Division Nine conducted its first full-caliber target practice in nearby Pentland Firth.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{consequence}} of demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase.

Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E

Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E
5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his right knee, and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required him to have yet another operation on his right knee. After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E

The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies for <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> war against Muscovy.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} of action that {{forfeited}} the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E
