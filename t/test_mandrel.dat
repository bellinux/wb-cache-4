40|$|It {{is common}} to {{investigate}} the thermo-elastic behavior of machine tools by measuring the 3 D-dislocation of the Tool Center Point (TCP) under several loading conditions. According to the ISO 230 - 3 standard, this can be achieved with extensive measurement procedures and expensive equipment (e. g. invar steel for the <b>test</b> <b>mandrel).</b> Based on the investigation framework stipulated by this standard and the R-Test measuring equipment, a novel method is applied that enables a holistic investigation of the thermal effects in an automated manner. This method automates the setup of the measuring instrument and simplifies the measurement in different positions in the workspace. The investigation of temporal and spatial dependencies of the TCP-dislocation is carried out on a 3 -axis machine tool. Additionally, various loading modes are applied in accordance to the aforementioned standard. The strong influence of the tool position in the working space leads {{to the conclusion that}} zero offset and distortion are two different error types that should be discriminated from each other. This error separation enables a holistic as well as more intuitive understanding of the thermal effects on the machine tool. The possible sources of thermal-induced errors could thus be deduced for the investigated 3 -axis machine tool and lead to anticipated conclusions for the particular construction...|$|E

In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the boring bar insert on continued boring operation. After every ten components being machined, the boring bar insert must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} <b>test</b> <b>mandrel</b> and a boring bar tool insert setting Vee-block. Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of tool insert setting Vee-block, though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting Vee-block is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the Vee-Block are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} methodology for accelerated {{testing in the}} area of high-temperature creep and oxidation resistance for thin-gauge superalloy materials. Traditional long-term creep (stress-relaxation) and oxidation tests are completed to establish a baseline. The temperature range used in this study is between 1200 and 1700 °F. The alloys investigated are Incoloy MA 956, Waspaloy, Haynes 214, Haynes 242, Haynes 230, and Incoloy 718. The traditional creep test involves loading the specimens to a constant <b>test</b> <b>mandrel</b> radius of curvature, and measuring the retained radius of curvature as a function of time. The accelerated creep test uses a servohydraulic test machine to conduct single specimen, variable strain-rate load relaxation experiments. Standard metallographic evaluations are used to determine extent and morphology of attack in the traditional oxidation tests, while the accelerated oxidation test utilizes thermogravimetric analysis to obtain oxidation rate data. The traditional long-term creep testing indicates that the mechanically-alloyed material Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes alloy 214 may be suitable for long-term, high-temperature (above 1400 °F) structural applications. The accelerated creep test produced a continuous linear function of log stress versus strain rate which can be used to calculate creep rate. The long-term and traditional oxidation tests indicate that Al 2 O 3 scale formers such as Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes 214 are much more resistant to high-temperature oxidation than Cr 2 O 3 scale formers such as Waspaloy. Both accelerated tests can be completed within roughly one day, and can evaluate multiple test temperatures using standardized single specimens. These simple experiments can be correlated with traditional long-term tests which require years to complete. ...|$|E

40|$|Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is used as}} {{a design}} tool within {{engineering}} industries due to the capability for rapid summative analysis accompanied by the visual aid. However, to represent realistic behaviour, FEA relies heavily on input parameters which must ideally be based on true figures such as data from experimental testing which sometimes requires time-consuming testing regimes. In the case of machine tool assemblies where complex structural joints and linkages are present, access to those areas can be a primary constraint to obtaining related boundary parameters such as heat flow across joints, for which, assumptions are incorporated to the FEA model which in effect increase the uncertainty in the FEA predictions. Similarly, in the case of thermal error modelling, simplifications are made when representing thermal boundary conditions such as the application of a uniform convection parameter to an assembly with parts assembled in both horizontal and vertical orientations. This research work aims {{to reduce the number of}} assumptions by providing experimentally obtained thermal boundary condition parameters. This work acknowledges experimental regimes that focus on obtaining thermal parameters related to the conduction across assembly joints (Thermal Contact Conductance-TCC) and measures the convection around areas such as belt drives and rotating parts to obtain convection parameters as inputs to the FEA. It provides TCC parameters for variable interfacial behaviour based on the varying contact pressure and the heat flow through dry and oiled contacts such as the conduction from spindle bearings to the surrounding housing and conduction from guideways into the associated assembly through carriages and contact bearings. It provides convection parameters across the <b>test</b> <b>mandrel</b> rotating at different speeds and around stationary structures such as convection parameters observed during TCC tests. It also provide details on the methods used to obtain all these parameters such as the use of thermal imaging, sensors placements and methods to obtain these boundary condition parameters. The significance of this work is to improve dramatically FEA thermal predictions, which are a critical part of engineering design.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{development of}} hard x-ray focusing optics telescopes at the National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC). High resolution grazing incidence optics has revolutionized {{our understanding of}} the universe at soft x-ray energies (< 10 keV) as illustrated by the exciting results from the Chandra Observatory (Weisskopf et al 2002). The hard x-ray energy band still remains relatively unexplored at fine angular scales with high sensitivities {{due to the lack of}} such technology.

40|$|A {{criterion}} for selecting a coating for an energy pipeline {{is that the}} coating should have a suitable flexibility to meet the high strain demand during hydrostatic testing and during field bending. This requires knowledge {{of the level of}} strain demand for the pipeline, and also the maximum strain that could be tolerated by the coating system. Whereas average strains imposed during manufacturing and construction are reasonably well predicted, there is insufficient understanding on the factors leading to localised deformation of the pipe. Significant work has been carried out in the past to develop tests for assessing the coatings’ ability to handle a certain amount of strain based on bend testing, tensile testing and burst testing. However, there is a concern as to whether these tests properly represent localised micro-strains associated with construction activities including field bending and pressure testing, particularly pressure testing of pipelines designed for operation at 80 % of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). Consequently coatings considered "suitable" for modern pipelines may fail. The first issue discussed in this paper is main factors affecting strain localisation. The non-deterministic distributions of heterogeneities over the pipe provide a ground to consider the mechanisms of localisation as a stochastic process. An approach is proposed to quantify the maximum localised strain demand through cold field bending and hydrostatic experiments. Another issue discussed in this paper is the experimental assessment of coating flexibility under the effects of localised strains. Preliminary <b>mandrel</b> <b>tests</b> have been carried out to assess the uniformity of the imposed strain. Although <b>mandrel</b> <b>testing</b> {{has been shown to be}} a useful method for relative comparison of coating flexibility, it has several weaknesses that could significantly affect the reliability and reproducibility of the results...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the fabrication process for producing high-resolution conical mirrors for hard x-ray astronomy. When flown aboard stratospheric balloons, these high-resolution reflective mirrors focus hard x-rays (10 - 70 keV) emitted from cosmic {{sources such as}} supernovae, neutron stars, and quasars onto imaging focal plane detectors. Focused hard x-ray images allow scientists to determine the elemental compositions, temperatures, magnetic fields, velocities, and gravitational fields of these celestial bodies. The fabrication process involves generating super-polished mandrels, mandrel metrology, mirror shell nickel electroforming, and mirror <b>testing.</b> Each <b>mandrel</b> is a cylinder consisting of two conical segments; each segment is approximately 305 -mm long. Through precision grinding these mandrels before super polishing, we have achieved 30 arc seconds, half power diameter replicated mirrors. During a May 2001 high atmosphere balloon flight, these mirrors focused high energy x-rays from three different celestial sources. However, we seek to improve the angular resolutions of future mirror shells {{by a factor of}} two. To achieve this goal, we have begun single point diamond turning the mandrels before super polishing. This has allowed greater precision tolerances on mandrel surface roughness and axial figure errors before super polishing. Surface roughnesses before polishing have been reduced from approximately 60 nm to approximately 15 nm. The peak to valley axial figure profile errors have been reduced from approximately 1. 0 micrometers to approximately 0. 4 micrometers. We are currently in Phase 2 of the HERO (high energy replicated optics) program which entails the production of sixteen 6 -m-focal-length mirror modules, each containing a nested array of 15 mirror shells of diameters ranging from 50 -mm to 94 -mm.

A chamfered specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter {{for the purpose of}} creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 32 S’C show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 88, chamfered specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require diametral strains of 2 % or greater for failure. Calculations made with a two-dimensional, finite elements code show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 84, the local strains in the clad ID over the segment interfaces are nearly identical for the regular and chamfered samples while the local stress in the chamfered sample is 1. 5 % greater. Results suggest that the smaller diametral failure strain of the chamfered specimen at low measured diametral strains is mainly due to its near plane strain condition and the higher hoop stresses resulting therefrom. 1...|$|R

When flown aboard stratospheric balloons, these mirrors are used to image cosmic sources such as supernovae, neutron stars, and quasars. The fabrication process involves generating super-polished mandrels, mirror shell electroforming, and mirror <b>testing.</b> The cylindrical <b>mandrels</b> consist of two conical segments; each segment is approximately 305 mm long. These mandrels are first, precision ground to within approx. 1. 0 micron straightness along each conical segment and then lapped and polished to less than 0. 5 micron straightness. Each mandrel segment is the super-polished to an average surface roughness of approx. 3. 25 angstrom rms. By mirror shell replication, this combination of good figure and low surface roughness has enabled us to achieve 15 arcsec, confirmed by X-ray measurements in the Marshall Space Flight Center 102 meter test facility. To image the focused X-rays requires a focal plane detector with appropriate spatial resolution. For 15 arcsec optics of 6 meter focal length, this resolution must be around 200 microns. In addition, the detector must have a high efficiency, relatively high energy resolution, and low background. We are currently developing Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride fine-pixel detectors for this purpose.

40|$|The ion {{figuring}} {{system at}} the Marshall Space Flight Center has been successfully used {{for at least three}} previous investigations into the ion milling of metals. The research was directed toward improving the surface quality of X-ray directing optics. These studies were performed on surfaces that were already hand polished to an excellent surface quality and were intended to remove the residual unwanted figure left by those techniques. The ion milling was typically carried out on <b>test</b> surfaces or <b>mandrels</b> that were several centimeters in width and length. The good thermal conductivity of the metal samples allowed the ion beam to be directed onto the sample for an indefinite period of time. This is not true of sapphire or most electrical insulators and problems have arisen in recent attempts to ion mill thin samples of sapphire. The failure and fracture of the material was likely due to thermal stresses and the relatively low thermal conductivity of sapphire (compared to most metals), These assumed stresses actually provided the key as to how they might be monitored. A thermal gradient in the sapphire sample will induce an effective index of refraction change and because of the shape constraint and the crystal structure and simple thermal expansion, this index change will be nonuniform across the sample. In all but simple cubic crystal structures, this leads to a spatially nonuniform optical retardance induced on any polarized optical beam traversing the sample, and it is this retardance that can be monitored using standard polarimetric procedures...|$|R
40|$|Tube {{drawing is}} a well known process {{involving}} at room temperature the reduction of diameter and wall thickness to obtain specified values. The initial tube is drawn into a die of a smaller opening and its thickness achieved by use of a mandrel. Usually, the mandrel has a land area which diameter defines by sizing the inside diameter of the final tube. Some structural components found in cars, aircrafts and other vehicles require bent or hydroformed tubes of lower weight. It is of interest to have tubes of varying axial or circumferential thickness so that to reduce overweight in low stressed areas and reinforce it otherwise. However, the production of tubes of varying thickness is more difficult in reason notably of higher metal flow stresses in the deformation zone {{and the need to}} control precisely the mandrel position during drawing. Axial thickness variation is obtained using a mandrel with stepped lands or with a slight taper while circumferential variation is achieved with a mandrel of desired internal or external shape (e. g. oval). In this paper, two techniques for axial tube wall thickness variation and one technique for circumferential variations are introduced and tested. First, the techniques to produce drawn tubes with thickness variations are presented. For testing, a small (335 kN) instrumented tube drawing machine is used. Details on this machine, process lubrication, monitored data and on the tooling implemented are also presented. Initial tubes are mainly AA 6063 extrusions of 63. 5 mm O. D. and 2. 6 mm thick and the final outside diameter, i. e. the inside diameter of the die, is about 47. 5 mm. AA 6061 tubes are also drawn. Starting with drawing <b>tests</b> without <b>mandrel,</b> the natural flow of the tube and the drawing force involved are measured. Secondly, tubes of 4 different thicknesses are produced with a stepped mandrel and the strain hardening effect on mechanical properties established. Using a tapered mandrel, tubes of continuously varying wall thickness are tested. Higher local pressure in the die corner radius restricts proper lubrication in certain conditions but results are promising in most cases. We also study the effect of thickness rate of change along the tube. Finally, tests with a stepped oval mandrel provided good results for circumferential thickness variations. The dimensional quality is measured using a coordinate measuring machine and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests in both initial and drawn tubes. Finally, despite some minor problems, the techniques proposed can efficiently produce tubes with thickness variations and have a very strong potential for industrial use.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the work of the European Structural Integrity Society Technical Committee 4 (ESIS TC 4) and its {{activities}} in the development of test protocols for peel fracture. Thirteen laboratories have been working on peel test methods in ESIS TC 4 since 1997 and their activities are ongoing. The aim of the work is to develop robust and credible test methods for the determination of adhesive fracture toughness by peel tests. Several geometric configurations have been used, namely, multi-angle fixed arm peel, T-peel, and roller assisted peel {{in the form of a}} <b>mandrel</b> <b>test.</b> The starting point of their work is an established analysis of a peel method that is often developed from a global energy approach. The adopted analysis is combined with an experimental approach in order to resolve ambiguities in the determination of adhesive fracture toughness (G A). The test methods involve the measurement of peel strength in order to calculate the total input energy for peel (G) and the calculation of the plastic bending energy (G P) during peel. The latter is often obtained from a measurement of the tensile behaviour of the peel arm. Adhesive fracture toughness is then G – G P. Four ESIS TC 4 projects are described. The first relates to fixed arm peel whilst the second and third involve both fixed arm and T-peel. The fourth project combines mandrel peel and fixed arm peel. Each project uses different types of polymeric adhesives in the form of quite different laminate systems. The selection of the laminate system enables all characteristics of laminate property to be embraced, for example, thin and thick adhesive layers, polymeric, and metallic peel arms and a range of flexibility in the laminates.
