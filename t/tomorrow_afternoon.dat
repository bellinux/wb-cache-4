2500|$|A snow {{emergency}} {{was declared}} for Washington, D.C., meaning that residents {{would not be}} allowed to park on snow emergency routes after 9:30p.m. local time on January22. Mayor Bowser urged people to remain home during the storm, [...] "nless you absolutely have to be out <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> , residents should get home as soon as possible". Across Maryland, 2,700pieces of snow equipment were mobilized and crews planned to distribute 365,000tons of road salt. In Virginia, 500vehicles were deployed to treat roads and 500members of the Virginia National Guard were placed on standby. Schools across the D.C. area were scheduled to end classes early on January22, before the storm's arrival. Stores across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. reported a substantial uptick in sales, with groceries, heaters, shovels, and similar items sold out in numerous locations. West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin mobilized the state's National Guard on January21.|$|E
2500|$|A MEETING {{of those}} {{favourable}} to the [...] "Association" [...] game of football as {{played in the}} home countries {{was held at the}} Australian Hotel last night ... The chair was occupied by Mr. W. McLauchlan. Among those present were a number of Scottish Association footballers who had recently arrived in the colony ... t was resolved that it was desirable to form an Anglo-Queensland Football Association, and as a beginning the meeting formed the first club, the name selected being [...] "St. Andrew's Football Club."

Mr. D. McCreadie and Mr. W.Hardgrave undertook to captain the teams.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to drive over to Loon Lake <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> to look into affairs there," [...] said Spencer. [...] "Will you go with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you want}} to play with poor Istra <b>tomorrow</b> Sat. <b>{{afternoon}}</b> and perhaps evening, Mouse? You have Saturday afternoon off, don't you? Leave me a note if you can call for me at 1.30. [...] I. N.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Harry bade me tell you, sir, that a gipsy boy he {{had never}} seen before has brought him a little note from his father. He will not return at present, but, if Mr. Harry can manage to slip away unnoticed in the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> he is to come here. He is not to come direct, but to make a circuit, lest he should be watched and followed, {{and it may be that}} the master will meet him here." ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{have sent}} Mealey [2] to day to you, before William [...] came, but now I shall write myself. I promise you, upon my honour, [...] I will come over <b>tomorrow</b> in the <b>Afternoon.</b> I was {{not wishing to}} [...] resist your Commands, and really seriously {{intended}} coming over [...] tomorrow, ever since I received your last Letter; {{you know as well}} as [...] I do that it is not your Company I dislike, but the place you reside [...] in. I know it is time to go to Harrow. It will make me unhappy; but [...] I will obey. I only desire, entreat, this one day, and on my [...] honour I will be over tomorrow in the evening or afternoon. I am [...] sorry you disapprove my Companions, who, however, are the first this [...] County affords, and my equals in most respects; but I will be [...] permitted to chuse for myself. I shall never interfere in your's and I [...] desire you will not molest me in mine. If you grant me this favour, [...] and allow me this one day unmolested, you will eternally oblige your ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, perhaps," [...] the Prince replied, [...] "would {{seem the}} hardest part of all. You would be {{required}} to start <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> from Southampton at four o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I suppose it's {{just your}} way. Only don't turn the poor fellow's head. By the way, Ned {{is coming up}} with his camera <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> to take us all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Trevor; [...] "as {{a matter}} of fact, I came {{to tell you to}} turn out for running and passing with the first <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> You're playing against Ripton on Saturday." ...|$|E
40|$|It is midnight, and {{the public}} high school in Springfield is silent and dark. A mile or two away, one of its students, call him Aaron, is seated in a dimly lit room facing the {{electronic}} glow of a computer monitor. Words, letter by letter, form themselves upon the screen. A young woman in Thailand, or someone who claims to be such, is describing the view of Bangkok from her office window. It is <b>tomorrow</b> there, early <b>afternoon,</b> and as Aaron glances out at the blackness beyond his bedroom window he tries to imagine that strange, distant city awash in sunlight. In a nearby room his younger sister, call her Beth, is sleeping. She is a student at Springfield Middle School, and {{on the floor beside}} her bed is the soft hulk of her bookbag, which holds, among other things, the homework she did earlier on the World Wide Web. Not having a computer of her own, as Aaron does, Beth uses the computer downstairs that {{is referred to as the}} "family computer. " In fact, the family has three computers, but only one of them is available to all family members. Beth had a science assignment that required her to gather information and pictures about endangered animal species in South America. At one time a student in Beth's situation would have ha...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Willard. [...] "I'll come up <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{and you and}} I {{will take}} a prowl about Eden and see what must be done. I'm ever so much obliged, Miss Sally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess," [...] {{she whispered}} anxiously, [...] "you'd better call a special {{meeting of the}} Aids at my house <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> If we're to get that social over before haying begins we've got to do some smart scurrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the man replied, [...] "there {{are three}} hundred more men coming. They will march in <b>{{tomorrow}}</b> <b>afternoon.</b> They {{will be getting}} the room on the first floor, below here, cleared out tomorrow morning for the officer who commands them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Susan, darling, I am not {{the happy}} bride. Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> while her father is away in town. A war-wedding, Susan--isn't that thrilling and romantic? I never was so excited in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have too}} much to do indoors," [...] he said. [...] "It would do you good to get a bit of {{exercise}} out of doors. Come down to the Coach Road <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and {{let me give you a}} lesson. Go on--" ...|$|E
60|$|This evening I sparkled and scintillated {{with unusual}} brilliancy, for Jack's visit and my {{consequent}} crossing of swords with Alicia had produced a certain elation of spirits. When Gus Sinclair was leaving {{he asked if}} he might see me alone <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him alone," [...] the Prince answered. [...] "Refuse {{this man}} Jacks {{permission}} to search my house during my absence. Tell him that I shall {{be there at}} three o'clock <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> and that at that hour he is welcome to return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so; {{he asked}} me to wait until <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> before going out with a flag of truce, and said that by that time he would get the other Zemindars to stand by him, and would make terms whether the Sepoys liked it or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk {{that out}} with the girl. I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh woman into giving you dates. This won't be a tithe as difficult. You had better not be here <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> because the Nilghai and I will be in possession. It is an order. Obey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let Marmee {{think we}} are getting things for ourselves, and then {{surprise}} her. We must go shopping <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Meg. There {{is so much to}} do about the play for Christmas night," [...] said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{a letter}} from Ella Kimball today, Anne, and she wants us {{to go over to}} tea <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> to meet her cousin, Irene Trent, from town. But we can't get one of our horses to go, for they'll all be in use tomorrow, and your pony is lame [...] . so I suppose we can't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two's {{quite a good}} {{allowance}} for that small bunch, but if you keep north among the scrub poplar, you won't be bothered by many fences. It's pretty dry in summer, but you'll get good water in Baxter's well, if you head for the big bluff you'll see <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> We'll let them out when you're ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she answered, smiling quite naturally. [...] "I {{will come}} and see Sir Wingrave Seton at four o'clock <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> You can tell him that I think it rather an {{extraordinary}} request, but under the circumstances I will do as he suggests. He is staying at the Clarence, I presume, under his own name? I shall have no difficulty in finding him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Marilla, but oh, {{what do you}} think? I am {{invited to}} tea at the manse <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon!</b> Mrs. Allan left the letter {{for me at the}} post office. Just look at it, Marilla. 'Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.' That is the first time I was ever called 'Miss.' Such a thrill as it gave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the mission}} that I intend to confide to you. I {{believe that it}} could not be in better hands. If you will call, <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> your written {{instructions}} and powers to act for me, and to enter into engagements in my name, will be ready for you; and I should wish you to start the next morning. You will have an escort of twenty troopers. These Indian princes have little respect for persons who travel unattended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. He implored me in {{his letter}} to run away and be married. But I cannot do that, Rilla, not even for Joe. My only comfort is that I {{will be able to see}} him for a little while <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Father has to go to Charlottetown on business. At least we will have one good {{farewell}} talk. But oh--afterwards--why, Rilla, I know father won't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't hear, either. Now {{mind what}} I tell you--I have reasons {{of my own}} for getting a little nearer to that window. Sit down under the paling, so that you can't {{be seen from the}} house. If you hear a row, you may take it for granted that I am found out. In that case, go back to London by the next train, and meet me at the {{terminus}} at two o'clock <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> If nothing happens, wait where you are till you hear from me or see me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, {{trying to}} speak lightly. [...] "My boy Larry {{has been trying to}} scare me about the rapparees, and, {{although}} I do not think that there is any danger to be apprehended from them, I do {{think that it would be}} just as well to hurry on your preparations, as much as possible, and for you and Claire to go in to Limerick <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> We can finish the packing up of the goods you wish to take, and any we cannot get off tomorrow can be sent in the next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will get}} my wire tonight. I'm hoping {{we shall see}} the dear old fellow <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> some time. How {{surprised}} old Eddie will be to hear that I'm engaged. He's such a confirmed bachelor himself. He {{told me once that}} he considered the wisest thing ever said by human tongue was the Swahili proverb--'Whoso taketh a woman into his kraal depositeth himself straightway in the wongo.' Wongo, he tells me, is a sort of broth composed of herbs and meat-bones, corresponding to our soup. You must get Eddie to give it you in the original Swahili. It sounds even better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{promised to}} meet the Youngest Twin Sailor down at the striped rocks <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> but the day after will do just as well. That is {{the beauty of the}} rock people, you know. You can always depend on them to be there just when you want them. The Youngest Twin Sailor won't mind--he's very good-tempered. If it was the Oldest Twin I dare say he'd be cross. I have my suspicions about that Oldest Twin sometimes. I b'lieve he'd be a pirate if he dared. You don't know how fierce he can look at times. There's really {{something}} very mysterious about him." ...|$|E
60|$|He wandered {{out into}} the house dining-room. Somehow, though Kay's was only next door, {{he could not get}} rid of the feeling {{that he was about to}} start on a long journey, and would never see his old house again. And in a sense this was so. He would {{probably}} visit Blackburn's <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> but it would not be the same. Jimmy Silver would greet him like a brother, and he would brew in the same study in which he had always brewed, and sit in the same chair; but it would not be the same. He would be an outsider, a visitor, a stranger within the gates, and--worst of all--a Kayite. Nothing could alter that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he didn't say a great deal--he isn't {{much of a}} talker, you know, {{but what}} he did say was to the point. It seems that your man, Prescott, doesn't come from Brampton, in the first place, and Grant says that while he likes soldiers, he hasn't any use for the kind that want to lie down and make the {{government}} support 'em. I'll tell you what I found out. Worthington and Duncan wired the President this morning, and they've gone up to the White House now. They've got a lot of railroad interests back of them, and they've taken your friend Sutton into camp; but I managed to get the President to promise not to do anything until he saw you <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> at two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} he would do very well, Bastow. Yes, he reads well, which I own I care for that {{a good deal more}} than for the preaching; not that I have {{anything}} to say against that. He gives sound and practical sermons, and they have the advantage of being short, which is a great thing. In the first place, it is good in itself, and in the second, specially important in a village congregation, where you know very well every woman present is fidgeting to get home to see that the pot is not boiling over, and the meat in the oven is not burnt. Yes, I will go down <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon</b> and ask him if he would like the living. You were talking of selling the furniture; how much do you suppose it is worth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{this case}} {{there is no}} {{necessity}} {{to enter into the}} question," [...] the doctor answered. [...] "The boy's lapse of memory refers, as I told you, to his past life--that is to say, his life when his intellect was deranged. During the extraordinary interval of sanity that has now declared itself, he is putting his mental powers to their first free use; and none of them fail him, so far as I can see. His new memory (if I may call it so) preserves the knowledge of what has happened since his illness. You may imagine how this problem in brain disease interests me; and you will not wonder that I am going back to Sandsworth <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when I have done with my professional visits. But you may be reasonably surprised at my troubling you with details which are mainly interesting to a medical man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{each place}} you will, if possible, see the syndic himself, and such of his council {{as can be}} got quickly together. The moment you have done all you can at Genoa sail for the Island of Madalena, which lies off the northeastern point of the island. There you will either find us, or a boat with a message where to direct your course. I think perhaps it will be best to omit Naples--it will save you fully a day, if not two, to do so. Pray them at Ostia to send off news down the coast, or to request the papal {{authorities}} to despatch mounted messengers. 'Tis likely that, at first, at any rate, the corsairs will try the narrower waters to the north. From here to Ostia is nigh two hundred miles, and if the wind is brisk you may arrive there <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and start again at night, arriving at Pisa before noon on the following day; while, allowing {{for four or five}} hours to ascend the river there, you may be at Genoa next morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will please deposit the boxes, fifty in number, {{which form}} the consignment, in the {{partially}} ruined building forming {{part of the}} house and marked 'A' on rough diagrams enclosed. Your agent will easily recognize the locality, as it is the ancient chapel of the mansion. The goods leave by the train at 9:30 tonight, and will be due at King's Cross at 4:30 <b>tomorrow</b> <b>afternoon.</b> As our client wishes the delivery made as soon as possible, we shall be obliged by your having teams ready at King's Cross at the time named and forthwith conveying the goods to destination. In order to obviate any delays possible through any routine requirements as to payment in your departments, we enclose cheque herewith for ten pounds, receipt of which please acknowledge. Should the charge be less than this amount, you can return balance, if greater, we shall at once send cheque for difference on hearing from you. You are to leave the keys on coming away in the main hall of the house, where the proprietor may get them on his entering the house by means of his duplicate key.|$|E
