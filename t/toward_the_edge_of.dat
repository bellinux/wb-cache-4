5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

The police and National Guard largely deployed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as they put out blazes.|$|E

The cap is [...] in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion-shaped (pulvinate). The {{surface of the}} cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's flesh is [...] thick, white when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens.|$|E

500|$|In 1952, Nurmi {{was persuaded}} by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former {{chairman}} of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and Sports Illustrated wrote that [...] "his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the track." [...] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower. In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the ship}} was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey {{was one of several}} ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's {{aircraft}} tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the deck. The two-inch steel ridge {{around the edge of the}} carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, [...] "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard." ...|$|E

At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, [...] "ANNUIT COEPTIS," [...] meaning [...] "He favors our undertaking." [...] At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming [...] "NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM" [...] meaning [...] "New Order of the Ages" [...] that is a reference to the new American era.

2500|$|The obverse of {{the seal}} {{on the right}} {{features}} a bald eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States. Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle's breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, {{the stars and stripes}} stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM," [...] a Latin phrase meaning [...] "Out of many , one ," [...] a de facto motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bill.

2500|$|On February 26, the searchers {{found the}} group's {{abandoned}} and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, {{the student who}} found the tent, said [...] "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind." [...] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a nearby woods, {{on the opposite side}} of the pass, [...] to the north-east. [...] However, after [...] these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest's edge, under a large cedar, the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire, along with the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the cedar and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent. They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the optical}} {{transfer}} function depends on {{factors such as the}} spectrum and polarization of the emitted light and the position of the point source.
