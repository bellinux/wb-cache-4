5|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the movie}} {{is set in the}} fashion world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the film, {{making it one of the}} most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E
5|$|Variations, corruptions, and vulgarized {{versions}} <b>were</b> noted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> {{long before}} the earliest printed publications. One such variation <b>was</b> dated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> Connecticut in the 1840s.|$|R
25|$|To {{represent}} tones, numbers 1 <b>to</b> 9 <b>are</b> usually <b>used</b> <b>in</b> Cantonese Pinyin, although to use 1, 3, 6 {{to replace}} 7, 8, 9 is acceptable. However, only numbers 1 <b>to</b> 6 <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> Jyutping.|$|R

5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> {{conjunction}} with other markers {{rather than as}} an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|As Christianity {{became the}} {{dominant}} religion, Attic began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> Christian writings {{in addition to}} and often interspersed with koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th {{at least until the}} 12th century, Attic remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods.|$|E
5|$|As {{for every}} match in the 2010–11 FA Cup, {{the ball for}} the final was {{provided}} by Nike-owned, Manchester-based sports equipment company Umbro. The Umbro Neo Pro features a 14-panel design, and is patterned in blue and red. The majority of the balls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the game arrived on the previous Wednesday, while the ball to be used at kick-off was delivered to the stadium {{on the day of}} the game.|$|E

Beep is also aimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> lieu of cash in some convenience stores and other businesses. The Beep system is implemented and operated by AF Payments Incorporated, which is primarily owned by Ayala Corporation and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century CE, {{literature}} {{written in}} Sinhalese script had emerged and the script began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> other contexts. For instance, the Buddhist {{literature of the}} Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used the Sinhalese alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) {{and put the}} lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word elf began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> English {{as a term}} loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E

5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Rolls-Royce {{started work}} on modifying some Merlins which were later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> British MTBs, MGBs, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were {{modified}} single-stage units {{and the engine}} was re-engineered {{for use in a}} marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.|$|E
5|$|In Career mode, players {{create a}} band name and select a guitarist {{from among the}} {{available}} characters. Eight characters, each representing a unique genre of rock music - {{are available from the}} start of the game: Eddie Knox, Axel Steel, Casey Lynch, Lars Ümlaüt, Izzy Sparks, Judy Nails, Johnny Napalm, and Pandora. Additional characters can also be purchased, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> later sessions.|$|E

5|$|In {{nitric acid}} {{treatment}} of lead-containing wastes, e.g., in {{the processing of}} lead–bismuth wastes from lead refineries, impure solutions of lead(II) nitrate are formed as by-product.

5|$|Individual {{and team}} sports {{developed}} in Britain — particularly golf, football, cricket, rugby, netball, lawn bowls, hockey and lawn tennis — were also exported. The British choice of system of measurement, the imperial system, continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> some countries in various ways. The convention of {{driving on the}} left hand {{side of the road}} has been retained in much of the former empire.|$|E
5|$|Many clubs provide {{training}} for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically {{from the back}} seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo. Simulators are also beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> training, especially during poor weather.|$|E

Some of the materials being <b>use</b> <b>in</b> this processed can include copper, aluminium, stainless steel, toll steel, cobalt chrome, titanium and tungsten.
