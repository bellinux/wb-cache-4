40|$|It is {{generally}} regarded that magnetic fabrics can effectively reveal strain in rocks. In order {{to investigate the}} relationship between different magnetic fabric types and different stages of strain, we conducted a combined analysis of rock magnetics, magnetic fabrics and mesoscopic deformation features for Early Triassic limestones from two areas in the South China Block. Samples from the Tongshan county, Hubei province underwent three stages of deformation, which provided an ideal opportunity to test the relationship between magnetic fabric and multiple deformations. The minimum axes of AMS and AAR ellipsoids are normal to the bedding and the intermediate and maximum axes tie within the bedding, indicating deposition and compaction fabrics having not been affected by tectonic strain. Samples from the Lian county, Guangdong province experienced tectonic strain as evidenced by pervasive pressure solution seams and calcite veins. The principal directions of AMS are scattered, but those of AAR are well clustered showing a <b>triaxial</b> <b>fabric.</b> The maximum axes of AAR are distributed around the maximum stress direction indicated by the geometry of calcite veins. The initial compaction fabric was replaced by tectonic strain. These results suggest: (1) AAR can better reflect pervasive strain than AMS; (2) Only {{under the condition that}} the scope of strain is less than that of the sample call magnetic fabric effectively reveal strain...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{elaborate}} {{finite element}} formulation {{was developed for}} the <b>triaxial</b> woven <b>fabric</b> (TWF) composites and this is presented in a parallel publication [Zhao, Q. and Hoa, S.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Single {{layers of}} <b>triaxial</b> woven <b>fabric</b> {{composites}} {{have been used}} to make communication satellite reflectors due to their extremely light weight with good stiffness and strength property. Special superfinite elements have been developed for the analysis of these lightweight materials. These superfinite elements are used for the deflection and stress analysis of a membrane sector of the satellite reflector subjected to lateral pressure. Due to the significant difference {{in the size of the}} satellite structure (order of meters) and the size of the superfinite elements (order of millimeters) it is not possible to model the satellite structure using the superfinite elements and computer facilities available in most labs (personal computers). In the process of finding a solution to this problem, a special similitude behavior for the deflection of the curved panels made of <b>triaxial</b> <b>fabrics</b> was discovered. Using this behavior, the deflection of a large-size reflector panel (order of meters) can be analyzed using models in the millimeters size range. Stresses in the triax reflector model were also calculated. However, no special similitude behavior was obtained for the stresses...|$|R

The triaxial yarns in three directions of 0 ° and ± 60 ° in micromechanical unit cell (UC) are idealized as the curved beams with a path depicted by using sinusoidal shape functions. The tensile and in-plane shear strengths of TWF composites are derived {{by means of the}} minimum total complementary potential energy principle founded on micromechanics. In order to validate the new model, the predictions are compared with experimental data in prior literatures. It is shown that the predictions from the new model agree well with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} the hyperelastic strain energy density function for <b>triaxial</b> weave <b>fabric</b> composites. The energy function, which comprises three components: matrix, tow, and interaction, demonstrates a nonlinear stress–strain response. The model constitutes the material expressions, initial straightening and elastic recovery coefficients, which carry mechanical meaning, properly defined {{on the basis of}} micromechanics and elementary structural theory. In the solution, existing widely used but highly iterative fitting procedure that can be cumbersome and computationally expensive is circumvented. It is found that this model captures the experimental response with exceptional agreement in both longitudinal and transverse stretching. During in-plane uniaxial tension, affected invariants are those aligned along the load direction and those off-axis, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse stretching, respectively. Mechanical isotropy has been found valid only in low strain regime. Regardless of load direction, matrix and interaction energies are found to be of isotropic nature...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} resistance and mechanisms of biaxial and <b>triaxial</b> non-crimp <b>fabrics</b> under bias extension loading is experimentally investigated. The bias {{deformation resistance}} of multiaxial non-crimp fabrics {{is found to}} be substantially lower than conventional single layer woven fabric due to the unique deformation mechanisms of rotation, sliding and compaction of the fibre tows. It is shown that the amount, line-tension and location of the warp-knitted stitches used to bind non-crimp fabrics have a major influence on the bias deformation resistance. It is found that lowering the amount and line-tension of the stitches facilities the tow sliding mechanism that reduces the deformation resistance of non-crimp fabrics. Fabric deformation is also affected by the location of the stitches, with stitches that pass between, rather than through, the tows reducing the resistance to bias deformation, again due to increasing ease of the tow sliding process. The warp knitting conditions needed to maximise the deformation limits of non-crimp fabrics are determined...|$|R
40|$|Impregnation of {{very fragile}} {{pyroclastic}} rocks using a low viscosity, non-magnetic resin enables large oriented samples to be consolidated and drilled to provide standard sized specimens. Samples from surge and pyroclastic flow deposits from Italy and Mexico have different magnetic fabrics. The surge deposits have the maximum and intermediate susceptibility axes forming a girdle distribution while the minimum susceptibility axes are well grouped with flow parallel or flow perpendicular declinations. The pyroclastic flow deposits have <b>triaxial</b> susceptibility <b>fabrics</b> {{in which the}} maximum axes are generally flow parallel or flow perpendicular, although more complex situations also occur. Measuremens of the anisotropics of isothermal remanent magnetization, low temperature susceptibilities and hysteresis loop properties suggest that the surge deposits can have an inverse fabric probably because of a dominant presence of fine grain size magnetite within titanomagnetite mixtures. The {{two different types of}} fabrics are associated with different mechanisms of emplacement. An increase downward of the magnetic lineation (L), foliation (F) and degree of anisotropy (Pj) within pyroclastic flow deposits are probably related to the increase downward of the shear stresses within the flow during movement...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{computationally}} the buckling {{of simply}} supported sandwich columns constructed using elastic cores reinforced by skin-sheets of <b>triaxial</b> weave <b>fabric</b> (TWF) composites. A novel computationally cheap volume segmentation based thin plate {{model for the}} elastic properties of TWF is first developed. The predicted elastic properties of TWF exhibit quasi-isotropic behavior and correlate well with published numerical and measured results. Having demonstrated strong agreement with established results, these properties are then employed {{in the use of}} a plate on elastic foundation concept to study the stability of sandwich columns under a uniaxially compressed load environment. The parametric study comprises the effects of thickness, aspect ratio, and modulus of the sandwich core (treated as an elastic foundation), as well as the inclusion {{of the effects of the}} initial in-plane and out-of-plane imperfections of the skin-sheets on the critical buckling load. Remarkable dependencies of the critical buckling load on these parameters are demonstrated, due to both independent and wedding actions, noting that a perturbation due to out-of-plane imperfections has been observed to be the most significant contributor to reduction in compressive resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study performed at E. S. A. -ESTEC {{was to create a}} faithfull finite element model of <b>Triaxial</b> Woven <b>Fabric</b> and to investigate the mechanical behavior of it. <b>Triaxial</b> Woven <b>Fabric</b> (TWF) is composed of three set of yarns that interlace at 00 – 60 + 60 degrees. The ability of TWF to maintain structural integrity even with a very open construction is unique among textile structures; a particular attraction of this material is that it is almost mechanically quasi-isotropic on a macroscopic scale, and so {{it can be used to}} construct ultra-thin structural elements from a single ply. This feature makes it particularly attractive to designers of spacecraft antennas and the next generation of low cost deployable structures. However the strong influence of the geometrical parameters on the mechanical behavior and the difficulties one has to implement this material in analysis codes is a drawback. The starting finite element model considered as starting point is a detailed one; it accounts for all the geometrical parameters of the yarn but it is made up of straight elements so it does not account for the real curved slopes that characterize the free parts of the yarn because of the cross regions of the fabric. Moreover the material definition is linked to Coordinate Systems whose orientation is fixed, so the material properties cannot follow the shape of the yarn itself. Starting from this, a new finite element model was created introducing improvements in the definition of the yarn geometry, the material properties and the number of Solid elements used for meshing the surfaces of the yarn. It will be shown in detail how the model is built. Validation was performed by comparing the prediction of the homogenized E 1 modulus of the fabric using different models and test results available from literature. A comparison between old and new results showed an unclear behavior which needed to be explained through additional tests. It was concluded that solid element model could have to be even more refined to obtain accurate results. Since such a refinement was not possible in the scope of this work, a new Shell element model was introduced instead. Simulation of mechanical test showed good agreement with models and test results found in literature. Finally an attempt was made to reduce the degrees of freedom of a complex TWF model with the use of superelement theory. Mechanical tests were simulated using the superelement TWF models in order to verify this technique. The results will be shown in detail and suggestions for future work will be made...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a few {{research}} {{studies have been}} published on the blending of unsaturated polyester and phenolic resins {{for the purpose of}} improving the fire properties of unsaturated polyester resins. However, there has been no published study on the cure and strain monitoring of unsaturated polyester/phenolic blends during composite manufacturing. In this study, non-crimp <b>triaxial</b> glass <b>fabric</b> preforms were infused with the unsaturated polyester/phenolic blends, and the strain developments inside the composites were monitored using fibre Bragg grating sensors, as the long and complex curing stages were progressing at different temperatures. Strain-free fibre Bragg grating sensors and also thermocouples were utilised for temperature monitoring and compensation in order to obtain true strain developments and residual strains. The results were associated with a study presenting the cure analyses of unsaturated polyester/phenolic blends. The unsaturated polyester and the phenolics were found to be incompatible and exhibited different curing mechanisms in the blends, which were also observable in the strain development results. This paper has been the first attempt to (i) process these novel resin systems in the vacuum infusion process and (ii) monitor the long, complex and high-temperature cure cycles and the strain developments in the vacuum infusion process using fibre Bragg gratings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceField {{studies in}} the Palaeoproterozoïc Daléma basin, Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier, reveal that the main tectonic feature {{comprises}} alternating large shear zones relatively well-separated by weakly deformed surrounding rock domains. Analysis of the various structures in relation to this major D 2 phase of Eburnean deformation indicates partitioning of sinistral transpressive deformation between domains of dominant transcurrent and dominant compressive deformation. Foliation is mostly oblique to subvertical and trending 0 - 30 ◦ N, but locally is subhorizontal in some thrust-motion shear zones. Foliation planes of shear zones contain a superimposed subhorizontal stretching lineation which in places cross-cuts a steeply plunging stretching lineation which is clearly expressed in the metasedimentary rocks of weakly deformed surrounding domains. In the weakly deformed domains, the subhorizontal lineation is absent, whereas the oblique to subvertical lineation is more fully developed. Finite strain analyses of samples from surrounding both weakly deformed and shearing domains, using finite strain ratio and the Fry method, indicate flattened ellipsoid fabrics. However, {{the orientation of the}} long axis (X) of the finite strain ellipsoid is horizontal in the shear zones and oblique within the weakly deformed domains. Exceptionally, samples from some thrust zones indicate a finite strain ellipsoid in <b>triaxial</b> constriction <b>fabrics</b> with a subhorizontal long axis (X). In addition, the analysis of the strain orientation starting from semi-ductile and brittle structures indicates that a WNE-ESE (130 ◦ N to 110 ◦ N) orientation of strain shortening axis occurred during the Eburnean D 2 deformation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} numerically the uniaxial stability of <b>triaxial</b> weave <b>fabric</b> (TWF) composites employing finite element (FE) model with homogenized constitutive relation. TWF, which presents high specific-strength and stiffness {{due to its}} porous and lightweight properties, was previously modelled using solid elements or plybased approach, and thus making computation considerably complex and timeconsuming. To circumvent these issues, the current FE formulation is of geometrical nonlinearity employing Newton-Rhapson method where TWF unit cell is treated as a standalone non-conforming composite plate element making use of the homogenized ABD stiffness matrix, where Aij, Bij, and Dij indicate the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness, respectively in which degree of freedom has been greatly reduced. By means of Matlab program, the currently formulated model has demonstrated good agreement with existing numerical and experimental results from literature in terms of elastic properties. For the buckling analysis, four types of boundary conditions are explored: fully simply supported, fully-clamped, free-simply supported and freeclamped. High dependencies of post-buckling patterns of compression load against both maximum and minimum deflections on numerous aspect ratios from 0. 25 to 5 are observed in TWF, from which a characteristic equation has been defined for practical convenience before the occurrence of post-buckling. Such equation is described {{on the basis of}} the critical buckling load, Nmax, and stiffness factor, S, the best characterization of which is expressed in a logarithmic manner. The study has recognized that the buckling characteristics correlate directly to TWF’s aspect ratios and level of rigidity imposed through the boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} {{slope of the}} northern Gulf of Mexico seaward of the Mississippi Delta is characterized by very rapid Quaternary sedimentation. Thick sequences of underconsolidated muds and mudstones are present, which are severely overpressured. In the Ursa Basin, Site U 1322 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) provided an excellent coring record of interleaved fine-grained turbidites and hemipelagic sediments, in part severely affected by submarine slumping and sliding after deposition. Cores were continuously sampled and analyzed for anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), to elucidate the effects of different transport mechanisms and degree of settling and consolidation on magnetic fabric properties. Generally AMS ellipticity increases with depth irrespective of transport mode, due to loss of porosity. Samples from slumped mass transport deposits (MTD), however, have higher AMS if compared to immediately overlying nonslumped material. MTD samples dominantly show <b>triaxial</b> magnetic <b>fabrics</b> whereas those found in nonslumped sediments are much more oblate. Long axes of the fabric ellipsoid reflect the direction of eastward to southward suspension transport in samples not overprinted by sliding or slumping. Short ellipsoid axes in non-slumped material are vertical, and thus parallel to the axis of maximum uniaxial shortening. In the MTD samples, many short ellipsoid axes are inclined, reflecting an overprint of the uniaxial shortening by bedparallel shearing induced by the slumping. Shear and MTD transport direction deduced from the fabrics is top to- SE, downslope along the morphological axis of Ursa Basin. Generally we show that magnetic fabrics of muds and mudstones are sensitive recorders of sedimentary and tectonic processes, {{and can be used}} to reconstruct essentia...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Low Wind Speed Turbine program, Global Energy Concepts LLC (GEC) 1 {{has studied}} {{alternative}} composite materials for wind turbine blades in the multi-megawatt size range. This work {{in one of the}} Blade System Design Studies (BSDS) funded through Sandia National Laboratories. The BSDS program was conducted in two phases. In the Part I BSDS, GEC assessed candidate innovations in composite materials, manufacturing processes, and structural configurations. GEC also made recommendations for testing composite coupons, details, assemblies, and blade substructures to be carried out in the Part II study (BSDS-II). The BSDS-II contract period began in May 2003, and testing was initiated in June 2004. The current report summarizes the results from the BSDS-II test program. Composite materials evaluated include carbon fiber in both pre-impregnated and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) forms. Initial thin-coupon static testing included a wide range of parameters, including variation in manufacturer, fiber tow size, fabric architecture, and resin type. A smaller set of these materials and process types was also evaluated in thin-coupon fatigue testing, and in ply-drop and ply-transition panels. The majority of materials used epoxy resin, with vinyl ester (VE) resin also used for selected cases. Late in the project, testing of unidirectional fiberglass was added to provide an updated baseline against which to evaluate the carbon material performance. Numerous unidirectional carbon fabrics were considered for evaluation with VARTM infusion. All but one fabric style considered suffered either from poor infusibility or waviness of fibers combined with poor compaction. The exception was a <b>triaxial</b> carbon-fiberglass <b>fabric</b> produced by SAERTEX. This fabric became the primary choice for infused articles throughout the test program.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the formulation and numerical computation of the buckling behaviour of <b>triaxial</b> weave <b>fabric</b> (TWF) composites subjected to mechanical and thermal loads. The formulation was constructed by adopting {{two types of}} numerical method, namely the finite element method (FEM) and the meshfree (MFree) method, based on the classical plate theory. A combination of Lagrange and Hermite interpolation functions was adopted in the FEM formulation whereas the Multi-Quadrics radial basis function was employed in the MFree formulation. The formulation complexities, high time-consumption and tedious computation attributed to previous studies, which considered a variety of modelling techniques for {{the description of the}} complex tow geometry, were identified as the primary disadvantages, preventing them from widespread use. Therefore, simplification of modelling the TWF is vital for convenience and practicality. Such simplification was provided from the literature by describing the constitutive relation of the TWF using the contemporary 6 × 6 ABD matrix, adopting the homogenized and segmentation methods. The former employs the periodic boundary condition while the latter considers the volume segment of a unit cell. These material expressions were employed in both FEM and MFree methods in order to study the behaviour, especially the stability of the TWF composite when subjected to uniaxial compressive mechanical and uniform thermal loads, focusing on the cases of all edges clamped and simply supported. The source codes for the mechanical buckling and thermal buckling for both FEM and MFree were developed in this study. Authentication and verification of the source codes were done by making comparison with selected problems from the literature. As aspect ratio increases, the TWF plate was found to be less resistant towards mechanical buckling, which was in contrast to the thermal buckling behaviour. Overall, good agreement has been found in models adopting the homogenized and segmentation methods especially for the plates that were fully clamped for both thermal and mechanical bucklings using the FEM and MFree methods. The plates with fully clamped edges were identified to have higher resistance towards mechanical and thermal loads in comparison with those of simply supported edges...|$|R

In the present study, composites prepared from four types of directionally oriented warp knit glass preforms with three different thermoset resins have been considered for the tribological characterisation. The tribological tests have been conducted on a reciprocating sliding test rig with ball-on-plate configuration.

Within the upper Weber Sandstone at Split Mountain, Utah, 430 cores from 31 sites were collected for magnetic characterization. The magnetic susceptibility ranges from - 10 to 10 μSI, indicating a mostly diamagnetic matrix, with degree of anisotropy up to 1. 6. Specific treatment of magnetic susceptibility allows using diamagnetic data. The fabrics are fairly clustered and <b>triaxial.</b> Sedimentary magnetic <b>fabrics</b> show a foliation plane {{parallel to the}} lamina of the sand dunes, without defined lineation.

40|$|AbstractFiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (FRP) {{are often}} used in sporting goods to increase their lightweight degree. Symmetric laminate are mostly used because of the complex deformation effects of asymmetric multi-layer Structures (MLS), which are also hard to handle in the complete production process. In the board sports industry almost all products are made out of symmetric biaxial or <b>triaxial</b> glass fiber <b>fabrics</b> to increase the stiffness and strength of the sandwich composites. Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) are used to reduce the high performance products’ weight. FRP are also well suited to integrate additional functions. An uncommon way for such integration {{is the use of}} the material intrinsic anisotropic coupling effects of asymmetric MLS. Based on these deformation effects of FRP an all-new snowboard with the so-called anisotropic layer design technology (A. L. D. -tech) was developed at the Institute for Structure Lightweight, Technische Universität Chemnitz. In this product the anisotropic coupling effects are used for implementing a riding specific deformation of the snowboard to increase the customer value. At present, the spin-off silbaerg TM Snowboards uses three different levels of the A. L. D. -tech for the worldwide first serial products with such coupling effects; snowboards made of glass and carbon fiber reinforced sandwich structures. By varying the fabric material and the lay-up of the A. L. D. -tech MLS, different characteristics of the riding specific deformation are adjustable. For developing and computing this all-new type of board sport product the researchers used a numerical approach using a Finite Element Method (FEM) software solution provided by ANSYS. The model based on the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) and focuses also the failure assessment by using Cuntze's failure criteria [1].
