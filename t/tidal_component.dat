To date, two commonly used data sources for such tidal studies in the ionosphere are the FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC (F 3 /C) satellite constellation and ground-based GPS-derived Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs).

We find that the zonal mean and <b>tidal</b> TEC <b>components</b> in F 3 /C and ground-based GIM data show qualitatively similar seasonal variability and spatial structure. However, the maximum amplitudes of the zonal mean and migrating <b>tidal</b> <b>components</b> computed from F 3 /C are consistently smaller than those from the ground-based GIMs, revealing a systematic difference between the two datasets. Conversely, the DE 3 amplitudes are generally larger in F 3 /C compared to GIM, potentially due to the higher zonal wavenumber of that component...|$|R

30|$|Most of {{the tidal}} {{dissipation}} {{that causes the}} recession of the Moon occurs in the oceans. The pattern of each <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> is complicated; see Coughenur et al. [15] and Poliakow [16] for examples. Each <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> has an individual period, and for each the pattern of local tide heights and phases depends on location. The combination of tidal components also depends on location, a complication {{for the analysis of}} rhythmites. The pattern for each <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> can be combined into a global series of spherical harmonic functions. In a global sense, energy dissipation causes each <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> to shift orientation with respect to the Moon’s attraction. This phase-shifted part of each <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> causes lunar tidal acceleration, semimajor axis rate, and eccentricity rate. Plate motion changes the shapes and locations of the oceans, and this causes substantial variations in the tidal acceleration over ~ 108  yr time scales [16]. Although the tidal acceleration varies over these long time scales, the Moon continues to move outward.|$|E

40|$|The sea-level is the {{composition}} of astronomical tidal and meteorological surge processes. It exhibits temporal non-stationarity due {{to a combination of}} long-term trend in the mean level, the deterministic <b>tidal</b> <b>component,</b> surge seasonality and interactions between the tide and surge. We assess the effect of these non-stationarities on the estimation of the distribution of extreme sea-levels. This is important for coastal flood assessment as the traditional method of analysis assumes that, once the trend has been removed, extreme sea-levels are from a stationary sequence. We compare the traditional approach with a recently proposed alternative that incorporates the knowledge of the <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> and its associated interactions, by applying them to 22 UK data sites and through a simulation study. Our main finding is that if the tidal non-stationarity is ignored then a substantial underestimation of extreme sea-levels results for most sites. In contrast, if surge seasonality and the tide–surge interaction are not modelled the traditional approach produces little additional bias. The alternative method is found to perform well but requires substantially more statistical modelling and better data quality...|$|E

A comparison of the results indicates that there is good quantitative agreement between TIDI and the model predictions during equinox, but the latter tend to underestimate the westward 2 diurnal tide and standing diurnal tide during solstice. For westward 2 and standing diurnal tidal forcing, both latent heating and planetary wave/migrating tidal nonlinear interactions are equally important. As a linear tidal mode, the GSWM cannot account for nonlinear processes, such as planetary wave/migrating tidal interaction forcing.|$|R

40|$|A time-period {{analysis}} tool {{based on}} stacking is introduced in this paper. The original idea {{comes from the}} classical tidal analysis method. It is assumed that the period of each major <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> is precisely determined based on the astronomical constants and it is unchangeable with time at a given point in the Earth. We sum the tidal records at a fixed <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> center period T then take the mean of it.

The stacking results were fitted using a sinusoidal function, the amplitude and phase of the fitting curve is computed by the least squares methods. The advantage of the method is that: (1) an individual periodical signal could be isolated by stacking: (2) one can construct a linear Stacking-Spectrum (SSP) by changing the stacking period T(s); (3) the time-period distribution of the singularity component could be approximated by a Sliding-Stacking approach. The shortcoming of the method is that in order to isolate a low energy frequency or separate the nearby frequencies, we need a long enough series with high sampling rate. The method was tested with a numeric series and then it was applied to 1788 days Lanzarote tide gauge records as an example...|$|E

GSWM- 02 is used in TIEGCM model (Hagan and Forbes 2002, 2003). GSWM- 00 includes monthly variable migrating tidal results in response to solar radiation. GSWM- 02 includes both GSWM- 00 results and the migrating and non-migrating diurnal and semidiurnal tides that are excited by latent heat release due to tropical deep convection, and offers monthly outputs. GSWM- 02 provides 13 diurnal and semidiurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>components,</b> such as standing diurnal and semidiurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>components</b> as well as eastward and westward propagating harmonics with wave numbers from 1 to 6 (W 6 -E 6).|$|R
30|$|A related {{question}} is ‘What is the non-migrating tidal spectrum {{in the upper}} thermosphere, {{and how does it}} relate to that at 110 km?’ The answer is not so direct, as the former is not simply related to the latter vis-à-vis vertical propagation. There are other mechanisms that produce non-migrating tides in the IT system. For instance, as shown by Hagan et al. (2009) and to some degree verified by Oberheide et al. (2011 a), the nonlinear interaction between DE 3 and DW 1 produces SE 2 and a stationary planetary wave with s = 4 (SPW 4). We might expect, therefore, that additional <b>tidal</b> <b>components</b> are produced by other nonlinear wave-wave interactions. In addition, Jones et al. (2013) demonstrate that the longitudinally varying ionosphere can, through ion drag interactions involving the DW 1 (migrating or Sun-synchronous) wind field excited in situ in the thermosphere, produce significant D 0 and DW 2 <b>tidal</b> <b>components</b> during non-solar-minimum conditions. The in situ generation of these waves was in fact suggested by Oberheide et al. (2011 b) based on CHAMP accelerometer measurements, and observational evidence for an in situ driven D 0 is provided by Lieberman et al. (2013). Jones et al.

The M 2 <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> contributes ~ 80 % {{of the current}} total tidal acceleration. Although the M 2 tide does not cause the total recession rate, the lunar anomaly paper [1] cites the M 2 calculation of a current + 29  mm/yr contribution [16] as though the M 2 rate was the total recession rate. For comparison, the DE 430 lunar ephemeris has a 31  mm/yr recession rate caused by the M 2 component. Other DE 430 rates are + 33.5  mm/yr from all semidiurnal tides, + 5.1  mm/yr from all diurnal tides, and − 0.5  mm/yr from zonal tides on the Earth and tides on the Moon [11]. Although [1] cites Poliakow [16] for support for a 29  mm/yr recession rate, it contradicts his calculations for large variation in the past M 2 -caused rate by saying “For the Moon’s recession to vary so greatly, tidal heights would have to increase enormously over time.” In addition to contradicting the cited paper, this statement seems to confuse the roles of local tide heights that influence rhythmites and phase-shifted components of global tides that cause the lunar recession rate. Any claim of steady tide heights based on rhythmites must be viewed with skepticism.|$|E

One of our objectives was to separate out the tidal from the nontidal components of the currents and to determine the most important tidal constituents. Tides in the Porsanger fjord are substantial, with tidal range on the order of about 3 m. Tidal analysis attributes to tides about 99 % of variance in sea level time series recorded in Honningsvaag.

The most important <b>tidal</b> <b>component</b> in analyzed surface currents records is the M 2 component. The second most important component is the S 2.
