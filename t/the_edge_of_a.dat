5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong 64 {{features}} a separate multiplayer mode with six minigames {{for two to}} four players. Monkey Smash is an open arena, deathmatch-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all of their own lives. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> platform. Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.|$|E

5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace. The United States agrees to stop Volgin's renegade faction, destroy the stolen Shagohod and eliminate the American defector, The Boss.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Homer {{decides to}} {{purchase}} an RV and the Simpsons set off for a vacation in the wilderness. After accidentally driving it off <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff, the family find themselves trapped in the woods. As Homer and Bart {{try to find a}} way back to civilization, Homer gets himself covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears.|$|E

5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} first {{recorded}} in 1002 as strondway, then in 1185 as Stronde and in 1220 as la Stranda. It is formed from the Old English word 'strond', meaning <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> river. Initially it {{referred to the}} shallow bank of the once much wider Thames, before {{the construction of the}} Victoria Embankment. The name was later applied to the road itself. In the 13th century it was known as 'Densemanestret' or 'street of the Danes', referring to the community of Danes in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), non-amyloid (meaning {{they do not}} absorb iodine from Melzer's reagent), and {{typically}} measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack clamp connections at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with sterigmata (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4μm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia that occur on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10μm.|$|E

5|$|When Cate {{traveled}} {{down the}} mountain via Gondola, defeating the H.A.R.M. helicopters in the process, she encounters Volkov and a gun duel ensues. During their duel, an explosion causes an avalanche to send Volkov over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff. Later, Cate is confronted by the Baroness, and another gun duel ensues. After defeating the Baroness, she reveals that she has also infected herself {{and is about to}} detonate. Cate hurries to clear the civilians off the streets, and hides inside a building as the Baroness explodes.|$|E
5|$|When {{exploiting}} distant {{food sources}} found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black spruce forest in interior Alaska. This allowed {{a high rate}} of caching in the short term and reduced the jay's risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. It slowly strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving near <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter {{under the influence of}} wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction around <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. At the time of peak intensity, the hurricane hunters recorded flight-level winds of 155mph (250km/h) and unofficial pressure of 949mbar (hPa; 28.02inHg).|$|E

Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car {{at the start of the}} game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E
5|$|However, Denmark was not keen on peace {{after their}} recent successes and {{witnessing}} {{the weakness of}} the Swedish efforts. The Netherlands withdrew their blockade, but were soon convinced by Denmark to support them again. France and England intervened for Sweden and the situation was again teetering on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E
