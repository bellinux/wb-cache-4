5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal.

5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) on top of <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and in practice often results in players only striking <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> {{in combination with other}} point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> and an aerator screen. Once <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

500|$|After packaging, <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> {{were stored}} {{from three to}} five weeks at [...] {{in a dark room}} as the yeast {{continued}} to ferment the remaining sugars in the beer. [...] The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of carbonation. [...] During this period, an average of four to five percent of <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> would burst due to carbonation levels exceeding the strength of <b>the</b> <b>bottles.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bottles</b> were {{regularly}} produced for many decades, but gradually declined in usage.

Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. The idea behind this was that <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.|$|E

Betrayed by scientists and Madeline, MB telepathically commanded the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board. Samus and Madeline are confronted by MB; as a group of Federation troopers rushes into the room, MB summons <b>the</b> <b>Bottle</b> Ship's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone.
