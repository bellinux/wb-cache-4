However, {{it was not until}} January 21, 1859, when the New York Legislature passed an Act, actually authorizing Hungerford to transfer his interest in the bank to Patterson; both would be jointly and severally liable for all bank debts incurred prior to the date of passage.|$|E
25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the host device had selected it.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin's December 1992 {{compromise}} with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over {{the language of the}} referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late 1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, began <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for April11.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Qiu and {{the other}} eunuchs were at the Left Jinwu headquarters. Han, however, had become fearful and was nervous and sweating. Qiu began <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} was wrong. Suddenly, {{a gust of wind}} blew up a screen, and Qiu saw many armed soldiers and heard the sounds of clanging weapons. Qiu {{and the other}} eunuchs were surprised and quickly ran outside. The guards at the Left Jinwu headquarters were about to close the gate to close them in, but Qiu yelled at them, and they, surprised, were unable to close the gates. Qiu and the other eunuchs ran back to Hanyuan Hall, preparing to report to Wenzong what was happening.|$|E
500|$|The Iraqi {{capture of}} Khafji {{was a major}} {{propaganda}} victory for Iraq: on 30 January Iraqi radio claimed that they had [...] "expelled Americans from the Arab territory". For many in the Arab world, the battle of Khafji {{was seen as an}} Iraqi victory, and Hussein made every possible effort to turn the battle into a political victory. On the other side, confidence within the United States Armed Forces in the abilities of the Saudi and Kuwaiti armies increased as the battle progressed. After Khafji, the Coalition's leadership began <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the Iraqi Army was a [...] "hollow force" [...] and it provided them with an impression of the degree of resistance they would face during the Coalition's ground offensive that would begin later that month. The battle was also a major propaganda victory for Saudi Arabia, which had successfully defended its territory.|$|E
500|$|The Midwest was {{the crucial}} battleground, and both parties poured in their resources, with Bryan {{spending}} {{most of his time}} there, as did Hanna. McKinley and Hanna began <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the flood of materials and speakers on the silver question had had their effect in the Midwest. Dawes began to slow the flow of pamphlets against silver, and set loose a flood of material favoring McKinley's tariff policies. Events favored the Republicans: wheat prices rose considerably in the final weeks of the campaign, lessening the enthusiasm of farmers for free silver. The Democrats alleged that Republicans were coercing workers into voting for McKinley on threat of losing their jobs; Hanna denied it, and offered a reward for evidence, that was not claimed. To Bryan's outrage, Hanna called for a [...] "Flag Day" [...] for the final Saturday, October 31, as the campaign again sought to link support for McKinley to patriotism, a theme echoed by the candidate as he addressed his final delegations. Hundreds of thousands marched through the streets of the nation's cities in honor of the flag; New York City saw its largest parade since 1865. Election day was November 3; on its eve Hanna and Dawes predicted overwhelming victory.|$|E

500|$|West Ham {{began the}} second half as the {{stronger}} team, and Vic Watson received the ball in a good goalscoring position but mis-hit his shot. Eight minutes into {{the second half}}, Bolton added a second goal in controversial circumstances. Outside-forward Ted Vizard played the ball into a central position and Jack Smith hit the ball past Hufton. West Ham's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost, but referee D. H. Asson overruled them, stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator. West Ham also claimed that Bolton had received an unfair advantage, as a Bolton fan at pitchside had kicked the ball towards Vizard, but Asson disregarded these claims as well and confirmed Bolton's second goal. At this point the crowd began <b>to</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Bolton would emerge victorious and many began heading towards the exits. Neither team had any more serious chances to score, and {{the remainder of the}} match was largely a stalemate with little inspired play. Late in the game, West Ham captain George Kay attempted to persuade Asson to abandon the match, but Bolton captain Joe Smith reportedly replied [...] "We're doing fine, ref, we'll play until dark to finish the match if necessary". The score remained 2–0 to Bolton until the final whistle. [...] The King presented the FA Cup trophy to Joe Smith and then left the stadium to cheers from the crowd. West Ham trainer Charlie Paynter attributed his team's defeat to the damage the pitch had suffered before kick-off, saying [...] "It was that white horse thumping its big feet into the pitch that made it hopeless. Our wingers were tumbling all over the place, tripping up in great ruts and holes".|$|E
