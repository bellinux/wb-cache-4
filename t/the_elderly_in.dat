The diet of <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area is characterized by a high intake of dietary fiber. Total numbers of anaerobic bacteria were significantly smaller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area than those in the Tokyo area. A significantly large number of bifidobacteria, but not of lecithinase-negative clostridia, was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area. Large numbers and high incidences of bacilli and lecithinase-positive clostridia (mainly Clostridium perfringens) were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area. Twenty-five genera and over 81 species were isolated from <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area, and 25 genera and over 92 species were isolated from <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area.

A significantly higher isolation rate of Bacillus subtilis was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area.

5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> <b>in</b> people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> <b>In</b> 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

Methods: The subjects were 1, 208 elderly women over 65 years who were enrolled in the Public Health Care Center from Apr. 2008 to Jun. 2008. Data were collected using questionnaires including general characteristics, health related behaviors and health status by nurses at the time of enrollment. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, χ 2 -test, Pearson correlation coefficients and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The major findings of this study are as follows: <b>The</b> <b>elderly</b> women <b>in</b> poverty show a tendency to have lower level in income, education, self-rated health, cognitive function compared with ordinary women in old age. The predictors of depression of <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> women <b>in</b> poverty were spouse's existence or nonexistence, type of insurance, cognitive function, and self-rated health.

40|$|Abstract Sheltered {{housing for}} <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> is an {{intermediate}} type of housing, between living in ones own home {{and living in}} an institution. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the changes in physical, cognitive and psychological abilities among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing during a two-year follow-up period. In this study psychological abilities were represented by depressive symptoms. The changes in the abilities of <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> people living <b>in</b> sheltered housing were compared with the corresponding changes among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> their own homes. Furthermore, the associated factors and the predictors of the decline in physical and cognitive abilities, as well as the depressive symptoms were examined. The control group consisted of elderly people who were matched with those living in sheltered housing in regard to age, sex, coping with activities of daily living and depressive symptoms. The data of this study were collected among <b>elderly</b> people living <b>in</b> 20 units of sheltered housing in Finland in 1994 and 1996. 725 residents were interviewed and 340 re-interviewed after two years. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the help of the Mini-Mental Examination test (MMSE). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the shortened version of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing were widows or widowers and lived alone more often than <b>the</b> home-dwelling <b>elderly.</b> They perceived their health as poorer, had less contacts with other people and had fewer hobbies than <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living at home. Nevertheless, they felt less lonely and were more satisfied with their lives than those living at home. During the two-year follow-up period the decline in the functional capacity of <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing did not essentially differ from the corresponding change among <b>the</b> home-dwelling <b>elderly.</b> <b>The</b> decline <b>in</b> physical and psychological abilities among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing was similar to the decline among those living at home. Even if the decline in cognitive abilities among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing was more rapid than the change among <b>the</b> home-dwelling <b>elderly,</b> <b>the</b> difference between the groups was slight. Living in sheltered housing appeared to have neither a negative nor a positive effect on the functional capacity of <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> <b>The</b> predictors of the physical decline among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing were a high age, poor physical abilities at baseline, a high number of depressive symptoms, the use of medication and a low number of hobbies. The predictors of the physical decline among <b>the</b> home-dwelling <b>elderly</b> were <b>the</b> female sex, a high age, poor physical abilities at baseline, a high number of depressive symptoms, health perceived as poor and low social participation. The predictors of the decline in cognitive abilities among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing included a high age, poor cognitive abilities at baseline, poor education, dissatisfaction with life and health perceived as good. Among <b>the</b> home-dwelling <b>elderly</b> <b>the</b> predictors of the decline in cognitive abilities were poor cognitive abilities at baseline and a low number of hobbies. Among <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> living <b>in</b> sheltered housing the predictors of depressive symptoms included a high number of depressive symptoms at baseline, poor cognitive abilities, health perceived as poor, a high number of feelings of loneliness, a low number of visits paid to other people and high education.
