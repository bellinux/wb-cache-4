5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism {{in the hope that}} they could still be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Air Force had two {{heavy bomber}} groups. The 43rd Bombardment Group was {{equipped}} with about 55 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low. The recently arrived 90th Bombardment Group {{was equipped with}} Consolidated B-24 Liberators, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the 38th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the 22nd Bombardment Group, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders, {{but two of the}} former’s four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area, and the latter had <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is <b>taken,</b> <b>so</b> bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E

25|$|Rumors {{and demands}} for a remake of VII existed for many years, but {{multiple}} reasons were given for why the project was not being developed. Three key original staff members returned to help with Remake: original character designer Tetsuya Nomura returned to both direct and handle character redesigns, original director Yoshinori Kitase acted as producer, while Kazushige Nojima returned to write the script. The decision to release Remake in multiple parts was <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> the team {{did not have to}} cut any of the original content. They also decided to add new content, and adjusted the original character designs to balance between realism and stylization.|$|E

The GCC has already approved Yemen's accession to the GCC Standardization Authority, Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC), GCC Auditing and Accounting Authority, Gulf Radio and TV Authority, GCC Council of Health Ministers, GCC Education and Training Bureau, GCC Council of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers, and Gulf Cup Football Tournament. The Council issued directives that all the necessary legal measures be <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> that Yemen would have the same rights and obligations of GCC member states in those institutions.|$|E

25|$|Captains of House are {{slightly}} different though {{in that they}} play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains {{have a lot more}} pupils to be responsible for. This difference is more evident in their original title of 'Helper'. They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present and minutes are <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> that they can be passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).|$|E
25|$|In 1846 {{the potato}} crop failed {{and there was}} a bad harvest, {{resulting}} in the price of bread going up steeply and causing 'a great distress among the poor', especially in Ireland where famine followed. But while affluent Torquinians collected over £4,000 for the relief of the Irish, many Devonians were less than happy about their own situation and decided to do something about it. Rumours of disturbances had spread around the town but no heed had been <b>taken,</b> <b>so</b> when at 7.30 p.m. on 17 May a crowd assembled in Lower Union Street the authorities were caught off guard as attacks were made on bakers' shops and women carried off the spoils in their aprons. As night drew on the rioters took advantage of the dark.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{accounts}} of direct compulsion, some evidence exists that precautions, at times, were <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> that the widow {{could not escape}} the flames once they were lit. Anant S. Altekar, for example, points {{out that it is}} much more difficult to escape a fiery pit you've jumped in, than descending from a pyre you have entered on. He mentions the custom of the fiery pit as particularly prevalent in the Deccan and western India. From Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, where the widow typically was placed in a hut along with her husband, her leg was tied to one of the hut's pillars. Finally, from Bengal, where the tradition of the pyre held sway, the widow's feet could be tied to posts fixed to the ground, she was asked three times if she wished to ascend to heaven, before the flames were lit.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} twelve weeks Emden and Müller achieved {{a reputation for}} daring and chivalry unequalled by any other German ship or captain. Müller was highly scrupulous about trying to avoid inflicting non-combatant and civilian casualties. While taking fourteen prizes, the only merchant sailors killed by the Emdens guns were five victims of a bombardment of British oil tanks and a merchant ship {{at the port of}} Madras, India, despite the precautions Müller had <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> that the line of fire would miss civilian areas of the city. Emden also sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet during a daring raid on Penang, Malaya. Thirty-six French survivors from Mousquet were rescued by Emden, and when three men died of their injuries they were buried at sea with full honours. The remaining Frenchmen were transferred to a British steamer, Newburn, which had been stopped by the German ship, but not attacked, so as to enable them to be transported to Sabang, Sumatra, in the neutral Dutch East Indies.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} two years, except for two visits to Italy during periods of {{political}} unrest, Verdi was based in Paris. Within a week of returning to Paris in July 1847, he received his first commission from the Paris Opéra. Verdi agreed to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto; the result was Jérusalem, which contained significant changes to the music {{and structure of the}} work (including an extensive ballet scene) to meet Parisian expectations. Verdi was awarded the Order of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. To satisfy his contracts with the publisher , Verdi dashed off Il Corsaro. Budden comments [...] "In no other opera of his does Verdi appear to have <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> little interest before it was staged." ...|$|E
