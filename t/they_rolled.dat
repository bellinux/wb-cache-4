5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{incidence of}} hooping was in ancient Egypt {{as early as}} 1000 BC, where children used large hoops made of grape vines, which <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> along the ground propelled by sticks, or swung around their waists a la the modern hoop. In {{other parts of the}} ancient world, hoops were made of stiff grasses as opposed to vine.|$|E
25|$|The Cornish {{infantry}} {{attacked in}} three columns. <b>They</b> <b>rolled</b> carts and wagons {{into the ditch}} {{in front of the}} wall to fill it and allow them to cross. The ditch was too deep for this to succeed, but the Cornish used faggots and scaling ladders to continue the attack. They nevertheless suffered heavy casualties, with all three attacking column commanders being killed, and were eventually driven back.|$|E
50|$|However, if {{the player}} can stack or kill, <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> and move again. If they again stack or kill, <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> again, {{and so on}} until they can only place or cannot move. So with {{the luck of the}} dice, game-changing {{sequences}} of moves can be achieved.|$|R

5000|$|If a {{character}} {{has a particular}} advantage, they may add a bonus die [...] - [...] <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> one more die, and discard the lowest <b>roll.</b> If <b>they</b> have a particular disadvantage (such as their flaw), they must add a penalty die [...] - [...] <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> one more die, and discard the highest roll.|$|R
25|$|The air {{had gone}} out of the Danish balloon, as <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> over to Sarel Burger – one of Namibia's four players named Burger. Having elected to bat, Namibia made 230 for 9, while Danish spinner Bobby Chawla took three for 42. After an opening {{partnership}} of 49 between Baljit Singh and Frederik Klokker, Sarel Burger took five wickets for 23 runs, as the Danes crumbled to 127 all out.|$|E
25|$|On senior day Penn State {{scored on}} offense, defense, and special teams, as <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> over the Hoosiers 52–7. After the Hoosiers jumped to a 7–0 lead, Penn State piled on 52 {{unanswered}} points. Zack Mills was 12 of 19 for 173yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Michael Robinson started at tailback and rushed for 85yards and a touchdown. Robinson was also 2 of 3 passing for 87yards and a touchdown. Senior Tony Johnson had three receptions, all for touchdowns, totaling 47yards.|$|E
25|$|When {{the forces}} of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos {{strengthened}} the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch {{their way to the}} Church.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{initially}} {{washed out}} of the Navy Officer's Candidacy School, but the Navy realized he had training skills, and Wood {{was made into a}} chief petty officer. He trained new recruits and traveled around the nation escorting men to training facilities. Wood was able to coach while in the Navy. In 1942, while he was waiting to be called up for duty, the Abilene school district hired Coach Wood on a day-to-day basis, {{and he was able to}} coach spring training for seventh and eighth graders. The following fall, while on furlough for a few weeks, Wood was asked to fill in as head football coach at Haskell High School where he is credited with one win. Wood also coached basketball in the Navy using new recruits to form teams. He would often convince men to play for him as <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> in for training.|$|E
25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> bandages, knitted socks, mitts, sweaters, and scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised money to send cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic feeling to Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days for these women consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E

50|$|The nanocar is a {{molecule}} designed in 2005 at Rice University {{by a group}} headed by Professor James Tour. Despite the name, the original nanocar does not contain a molecular motor, hence, {{it is not really}} a car. Rather, it was designed to answer the question of how fullerenes move about on metal surfaces; specifically, whether <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> or slide (<b>they</b> <b>roll).</b>|$|R

The monitors were fitted with three iron pole masts, probably fore-and-aft rigged, and used to steady the ship rather than for propulsion.|$|E

In service the ships proved to be buoyant and seaworthy although <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> heavily which meant that their decks were often awash. Their flat bottom and small rudder, however, caused steering problems before the wind. Because of their seaworthiness and powerful guns they have been judged superior to any monitor built by the United States Navy.|$|E

However, he had mixed feelings about her going to Tokyo, because that would mean that they would be separated. Hence, when Sae managed to get into Waseda University, Kouhei at first refused to see her off. However, at his friends' urging, they got onto a boat and chased after Sae, and when they saw her, <b>they</b> <b>rolled</b> out a banner reading, [...] "Good Luck Sae!".|$|E
