Although aerospace managers and nonmanagers were found to have different <b>technical</b> <b>communications</b> practices, the evidence was neither conclusive nor compelling that the presumption of difference in practices could be attributed to the duties performed by aerospace managers and nonmanagers...|$|R

40|$|Aerospace {{engineers}} and scientists from Western Europe, Japan, and the United States were surveyed {{as part of}} the NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project. Questionnaires were used to solicit their opinions regarding the following: (1) the importance of <b>technical</b> <b>communications</b> to their profession; (2) the use and production of technical communications; and (3) their views about the appropriate content of an undergraduate course in <b>technical</b> <b>communications.</b> The ability to communicate technical information effectively was very important to the aerospace {{engineers and}} scientists who participated in the study. A considerable portion of their working week is devoted to using and producing technical information. The types of <b>technical</b> <b>communications</b> used and produced varied within and among the three groups.
