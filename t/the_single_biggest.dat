5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been turned}} down by several {{professional}} clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce {{was about to start}} work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> influence on his career.|$|E
5|$|The November 1959 {{uprising}} and {{the subsequent}} fighting between Hutu and Tutsi began the revolution, but according to Carney it was the Belgian response which ensured that it {{would result in a}} permanent reversal {{in the role of the}} two groups, with the Hutu emerging in power. <b>The</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> decision maker in this response was Colonel Guy Logiest, a Belgian army colonel working in the Congo with the Force Publique. Logiest was a personal friend of Ruanda-Urundi governor Jean-Paul Harroy, and had already been asked, before the start of the revolution, to come to Rwanda to evaluate Belgium's military options in the colony. Following the outbreak of violence, Logiest accelerated his departure from the Congo, arriving in Rwanda on 4 November. Logiest arrived with a number of soldiers and paratroopers and was tasked with re-establishing civil order.|$|E
5|$|The {{percentage}} of England's population living in towns {{continued to grow}} but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly {{as a consequence of}} the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, as trade from London and the South-West increased in relative significance. Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time and investment in trading ships such as cogs was probably <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> form of late medieval investment in England.|$|E

5|$|In early 1997, Paramount's Carowinds began {{consultations}} with roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard about {{adding a new}} ride to their park. During 18 months of discussions, several designs and themes for the ride were developed, including theming it to the Godzilla franchise. In July 1998, the park announced the addition of Top Gun: The Jet Coaster for the 1999 season. At a cost of $10.5 million, it would be <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> investment in the park's history. The announcement followed Paramount Parks adding Top Gun-themed inverted and suspended roller coasters to several of their parks throughout the 1990s, including Paramount's Great America, Paramount Canada's Wonderland, and Paramount's Kings Island. To construct the attraction at Carowinds, the park's Bayern Kurve ride, Wild Bull, had to be removed. The park intended to keep the ride in storage for a potential relocation elsewhere within the park. The removal of Wild Bull shortened construction time because no trees or buildings had to be removed. Construction began in late July 1998, with the first track arriving in August. Testing was completed in January 1999.|$|E

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} produced enough smoke {{to reveal}} their location to enemy artillery and aircraft. Steam locomotives required fog or darkness to operate within visual range of the front. Daylight transport usually required animal power until internal combustion locomotives were developed.

Fodder for horses constituted <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> commodity exported from Britain to France during the war.|$|E

25|$|The Music Hall {{was planned}} by a {{consortium}} of three architectural firms, who employed Edward Durell Stone to design the exterior. Through the direction of Abby Rockefeller, the interior design was given to Donald Deskey, an exponent of the European Modernist style and innovator of a new American design aesthetic. Deskey believed the space would be best served by sculptures and wall paintings and commissioned various artists for the large elaborate works in the theater. The Music Hall seats 6,000 people and after an initial slow start became <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> tourist destination in the city. Its interior was declared a New York City landmark in 1978. Painstakingly restored in 1999, the Music Hall interiors {{are one of the}} world's greatest examples of Art Deco design.|$|E

Hogan, as the premier WWF icon, headlined seven of the first eight WrestleMania events. He also co-hosted Saturday Night Live on March 30, 1985 during this lucrative run. AT reported that the 900 number information line he ran while with the WWF was <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> 900 number from 1991 to 1993.

25|$|At {{that time}} orchid seed {{germination}} was traditionally a {{hit or miss}} affair, and <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>biggest</b> factor preventing orchid growing from moving from being a rich-man’s hobby to a business where money could be made. Irregular and irreproducible germination seriously hampered the speed and success rate of Mead’s hybridization efforts, {{and it was not}} uncommon for him to have to wait 10 or more years before a new orchid bloomed for the first time, in one instance taking 17 years. But Mead was a patient man, employing scientific principles and keeping detailed and careful notes. His horticultural notebook in the Michael A. Spencer Collection on Theodore Mead, Special Collections and University Archives, University of Central Florida, lists several thousand crosses as well as information on all his other plants. In addition, he photographed many of his new creations.|$|E
