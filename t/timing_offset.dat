40|$|Repointing a NIF beam to hit {{a target}} {{position}} off target chamber center (TCC) will introduce a timing shift due {{to changes in the}} light pathlength. This shift could be important for target experiment requirements even for targets placed at TCC, since beam timing test shots will place beams up to 15 mm off TCC in order to spatially separate them on foil targets. In particular, timing errors due to beam repointing need to be considered against the 30 ps RMS timing requirement. Since the repointing process will keep the beam passing through a fixed point in the final optics assembly (the conversion crystal) by tip/tilt adjustments of two turning mirrors (LM 5 and LM 7), the problem naturally divides into two parts: Timing offsets past the conversion crystal due to target positioning changes, and <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> behind the fixed point on the conversion crystal due to turning mirror adjustments. Timing offsets past the conversion crystal can be significant, but are trivial to calculate exactly; however, an exact calculation of <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> behind the fixed point on the conversion crystal would require a three-dimensional optomechanical raytrace model to be developed for every beamline, and this would be difficult and expensive. In this memo, I estimate the magnitude of <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> due to pathlength changes behind the conversion crystal by analysis of a worst-case model.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} several {{approaches for}} signal sampling and reconstruction given different {{assumptions about the}} signal, the type of errors that occur, and the information available about the signal. The thesis first considers the effects of quantization in the environment of interleaved, oversampled multi-channel measurements with the potential of different quantization step size in each channel and varied <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> between channels. Considering sampling together with quantization in the digital representation of the continuous-time signal is shown to be advantageous. With uniform quantization and equal quantizer step size in each channel, the effective overall signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed output is shown to be maximized when the <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> between channels are identical, resulting in uniform sampling when the channels are interleaved. However, with different levels of accuracy in each channel, the choice of identical <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> between channels is in general not optimal, with better results often achievable with varied <b>timing</b> <b>offsets</b> corresponding to recurrent nonuniform sampling when the channels are interleaved. Similarly, it is shown that with varied <b>timing</b> <b>offsets,</b> equal quantization step size in each channel is in general not optimal, and a higher signal-to-quantization-noise ratio is often achievable with different levels of accuracy in the quantizers in different channels. Another aspect of this thesis considers nonuniform sampling in which the sampling grid is modeled as a perturbation of a uniform grid. Perfect reconstruction from these nonuniform samples is in general computationally difficult; as an alternative, this work presents a class of approximate reconstruction methods based {{on the use of}} time-invariant lowpass filtering, i. e., sinc interpolation. When the average sampling rate is less than the Nyquist rate, i. e., in sub-Nyquist sampling, the artifacts produced when these reconstruction methods are applied to the nonuniform samples can be preferable in certain applications to the aliasing artifacts, which occur in uniform sampling. The thesis also explores various approaches to avoiding aliasing in sampling. These approaches exploit additional information about the signal apart from its bandwidth and suggest using alternative pre-processing instead of the traditional linear time-invariant anti-aliasing filtering prior to sampling. by Shay Maymon.

40|$|Spectrum sensing is an {{important}} aspect of an (interweave) cognitive radio network. In the particular case of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, many previous spectrum sensing algorithms have utilized the unique correlation properties provided by the cyclic prefix (CP). However, they have also had to both estimate and compensate for the inherent <b>timing</b> <b>offset</b> of a practical system. This is because the <b>timing</b> <b>offset</b> will affect both the test statistic and the threshold, and the inaccurate estimation of <b>timing</b> <b>offset</b> will lead to poor performance. So in this paper, we propose an improved CP detector by constructing a likelihood ratio test (LRT) based on the multivariate probability density functions (pdf) of a particular auto-correlation vector that is chosen to exploit the existence of the CP. This leads to ‘probability of detection’ (Pd) and ‘probability of false alarm’ (Pf) terms that are actually independent of <b>timing</b> <b>offset,</b> and we can get an accurate threshold without estimating <b>timing</b> <b>offset.</b> Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods, even for low SNR values.
