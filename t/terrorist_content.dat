2500|$|On 25 November 2014, the {{findings}} of a British parliamentary inquiry into the murder of Lee Rigby were published. The report found that the death could not have been prevented, although his killers had appeared in seven intelligence investigations. In December 2012, Michael Adebowale had discussed killing a soldier on Facebook with a foreign-based extremist known as [...] "Foxtrot". The UK authorities did not have access to the details of the conversation until June 2013, when they were disclosed to GCHQ. The Intelligence and Security Committee stated [...] "Had MI5 had access to this exchange, their investigation into Adebowale would have become a top priority." [...] Facebook said that it did not comment on individual cases, but responded that [...] "Facebook’s policies are clear, we do not allow <b>terrorist</b> <b>content</b> on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes." [...] In an interview with BBC News on 26 November 2014, Richard Barrett, the former Director of Global Counter-terrorism at MI6, said that it was unfair to expect companies to monitor websites for all potentially extremist content. Facebook had blocked seven of Adebowale's accounts prior to the killing, five of which had been flagged for links with extremism. The accounts had been flagged by an automated process, and no person at Facebook had manually checked the accounts.|$|E

50|$|Steven Stalinsky is {{an expert}} on the Middle East, {{terrorism}} and terrorist use of the Internet, and encryption technologies, and has served as Executive Director of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) since 1999. Stalinsky has briefed staff of the White House, State Department, Homeland Security, Justice Department, Office of Director of National Intelligence, Defense Department, Capitol Hill and other institutions. Since 2006, his research has focused on detailing and developing strategies against cyber jihad, describing how terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and others use the Internet, social media, and encryption for propaganda, recruiting, and hacking.

5000|$|Mr. Stalinsky has {{authored}} over 100 {{research reports}} {{while at the}} Middle East Media Research Institute, on issues ranging from reform in the Arab world to online activity by Al-Qaeda, ISIS, the Taliban and other terrorist organizations, {{as well as their}} use of encryption technology. Other research reports detailed terrorist use of U.S.-based libraries such as the Internet Archive, Arab and Iranian hacking groups and more. He {{was one of the first}} to write about Jihadism's use of social media, including YouTube, Twitter and Telegram, with a series of research reports on specific terrorist activity, such as Hezbullah's presence on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and apps from Google Play and iTunes. He also reported on the thousands of YouTube videos - with over 3 million views at that time - featuring extremist Yemeni-American sheikh Anwar Al-Awlaki [...] Stalinsky led early efforts to persuade YouTube to add a feature to flag <b>terrorist</b> <b>content,</b> and one of his reports documented his 2010 meeting with Google officials on this matter. Another report detailed his years of effort to prompt Twitter to take action about Jihadis' use of their social networking service - efforts which culminated in a 2013 Congressional letter to the FBI urging them to take action.|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>terrorist</b> generated <b>content</b> online {{is a cause}} for concern as it goes together with the rise of radicalisation and violent extremism. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) need powerful platforms to help stem the influence of such content. This article showcases the TENSOR project which focusses on the early detection of online terrorist activities, radicalisation and recruitment. Operating under the H 2020 Secure Societies Challenge, TENSOR aims to develop a terrorism intelligence platform for increasing the ability of LEAs to identify, gather and analyse terrorism-related online content. The mechanisms to tackle this challenge by bringing together LEAs, industry, research, and legal experts are presented...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} sought to {{understand}} individuals' motivations for terrorism through <b>terrorist</b> material <b>content.</b> To date, these studies have not capitalised on automated language analysis techniques, particularly those of corpus linguistics. In this paper, we demonstrate how applying three corpus-linguistic techniques to extremist statements can provide insights into their ideology. Our data consisted of 250 statements (approximately 500, 000 words) promoting terrorist violence. Using the online software tool WMatrix, we submitted these data to frequency count, key word and key concept, and concordance analyses. Results showed that authors centre their rhetoric on themes of morality, social proof, inspiration and appeals to religion, and refer to the world via contrasting concepts, suggesting a polarised way of thinking compared to a general population usage. Additionally, we show how collocation can aid the establishment of networks between people and places. We discuss how such analyses might support the formulation of evidence based counter-terrorism strategie...|$|R
40|$|The posting of {{journalist}} beheadings {{online and}} the arrests of numerous nationals attempting to join terrorist organizations {{have shown that}} terrorists are increasingly using social media to spread ideology and recruit members. The popularity of social media around the world provides a huge potential audience for <b>terrorist</b> <b>content.</b> Unfortunately, because of states 2 ̆ 7 inability to cooperate, previous attempts to govern and police the Internet have failed. Any regulation of the Internet or social media also raises collective action problems and baseline definition issues. The U. N. {{is not in the}} position to pass a binding treaty or convention because use of social media by terrorists is harder to identify than other regulated areas of internet use. Disagreement among U. N. members on whether internet governance should be implemented by the international community also makes a treaty unlikely. Despite these problems, this Comment suggests that the U. N. still has an important role to play in the regulation of <b>terrorist</b> <b>content</b> in social media. By taking a role as a coordinator between states, the U. N. can create an effective monitoring regime that reduces the costs of internet governance and promotes coordination between states...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examined}} {{the extent of}} e-crime in the United Kingdom. Conclusions The Committee concluded that:A dedicated {{state of the art}} espionage response team should be established so that British companies, media, and institutions can immediately contact it to report an attack so that effective action can be taken. There appears to be a ‘black hole’ where e-crime is committed with impunity. Online criminal activity which defrauds victims of money is often not reported to or investigated by law enforcement. Banks simply reimburse the victims with no pursuit of the perpetrators. Criminals who commit a high volume of low level fraud can still make huge profits. Banks must be required to report all e-crime fraud to law enforcement. It is alarmed that CEOP is having its budget cut by 10 % over 4 years and it could lose its laser-like focus when merged with the NCA. It is still too easy for people to access inappropriate online content, particularly indecent images of children, terrorism incitement and sites informing people how to commit online crime. There is no excuse for complacency. The Committee urges those responsible to take stronger action to remove such content. The Government should draw up a mandatory code of conduct with them to remove material which breaches acceptable standards. The DPP should review sentencing guidance and ensure e-criminals receive the same sentences as if they had stolen {{the same amount of money}} or data offline. The Government should look at setting up a similar organisation to the Internet Watch Foundation focused on reporting and removing online <b>terrorist</b> <b>content.</b> The Committee encourages those companies who donate to the Internet Watch Foundation to give more...|$|E
40|$|Terrorist {{organizations}} have found social media websites to be invaluable for disseminating ideology, recruiting terrorists, and planning operations. National and international leaders have repeatedly {{pointed out the}} dangers terrorists pose to ordinary people and state institutions. In the United States, the federal Communications Decency Act’s § 230 provides social networking websites with immunity against civil law suits. Litigants have therefore been unsuccessful in obtaining redress against internet companies who host or disseminate third-party <b>terrorist</b> <b>content.</b> This Article demonstrates that § 230 does not bar private parties from recovery if they can prove that a social media company had received complaints about specific webpages, videos, posts, articles, IP addresses, or accounts of foreign terrorist organizations; the company’s failure to remove the material; a terrorist’s subsequent viewing of or interacting with the material on the website; and that terrorist’s acting upon the propaganda to harm the plaintiff. This Article argues that irrespective of civil immunity, the First Amendment does not limit Congress’s authority to impose criminal liability on those content intermediaries who have been notified that their websites are hosting third-party foreign terrorist incitement, recruitment, or instruction. Neither the First Amendment nor the Communications Decency Act prevents this form of federal criminal prosecution. A social media company can be prosecuted for material support of terrorism if it is knowingly providing a platform to organizations or individuals who advocate the commission of terrorist acts. Mechanisms will {{also need to be}} created that can enable administrators to take emergency measures, while simultaneously preserving the due process rights of internet intermediaries to challenge orders to immediately block, temporarily remove, or permanently destroy data...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{intelligence}} and security informatics based on statistical computations is becoming more significant in detecting terrorism activities proactively as the extremist groups are misusing many of the obtainable facilities on the Internet to incite violence and hatred. However, the performance of statistical methods is limited due to the inadequate accuracy produced by the inability of these methods to comprehend the texts created by humans. In this paper, we propose a hybridized feature selection method based on the basic term-weighting techniques for accurate terrorism activities detection in textual contexts. The proposed method combines the feature sets selected based on different individual feature selection methods into one feature space for effective web pages classification. UNION and Symmetric Difference combination functions are proposed for dimensionality reduction of the combined feature space. The method is tested on a selected dataset from the Dark Web Forum Portal and benchmarked using various famous text classifiers. Experimental {{results show that the}} hybridized method efficiently identifies the <b>terrorist</b> activities <b>content</b> and outperforms the individual methods. Furthermore, the results revealed that the classification performance achieved by hybridizing few feature sets is relatively competitive in the number of features used for classification with higher hybridization levels. Moreover, the experiments of hybridizing functions show that the dimensionality of the feature sets is significantly reduced by applying the Symmetric Difference function for feature sets combination...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} {{terrorism}} training follows the logic that terrorism is a "wicked problem" {{and there are}} various strategies to cope with it. Systems thinking {{is one of the}} coping strategies to address "wicked problems. " A system is a whole composed of complex organized elements (subsystems) interacting {{with each other and with}} their environment. The stability of a system depends on its components' alignment. Misaligning one of its components, will destabilize, or even disrupt the whole system. In this regard, the study defines terrorism and terrorist organizations in systems terms, explains their components and interrelations, and concludes that the most important component of a terrorist system is the training subsystem. Thus it is important to understand how the subsystem functions in order to disrupt the whole system. The study reviews the types of terrorist training, how the terrorists and their organizations learn (process), what the <b>terrorists</b> learn (<b>content),</b> where the <b>terrorists</b> learn (location) and concludes that the internet is the new safe haven for terrorist training. It also demonstrates the adaptive capability of terrorist system moving from land-based to internet-based training. Almost every terrorist organization on the US Sate Department's designated terrorist organizations list exists on the Net. One example is the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) terrorist network. Its website network is analyzed by content and network structure using social network analysis software UCINET. The goal is to develop strategies to eliminate the web presence of the terrorist training subsystem...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{discovery}} of terrorist-related Web resources, the Dark Web project at the University of Arizona has provided the most comprehensive multilingual suite of text and Web mining tools for performing link and content analysis aiming at studying and understanding terrorist and extremist phenomena [9]. Furthermore, a methodology for collecting and analyzing Dark Web information has been applied {{on a set of}} Jihad Web sites, with the aim to aid the process of intelligence gathering and to improve the understanding of terrorist and extremist activities [10]. Both projects have addressed the whole breadth of <b>terrorist</b> and extremist <b>content,</b> rather than HME information, as done here. In addition, these research efforts have addressed the Dark Web in a different context than the one provided within this work; with the term “Dark Web,” they refer to the part of the Surface Web helping to achieve the subversive objectives of terrorists and extremists by publishing relevant content on various forms, including Web sites, forums, blogs, social network sites, and virtual world sites.|$|R
5000|$|The {{major portion}} {{of the film is}} spent {{addressing}} excerpts from the countless memos, nicknamed 'Yellow Perils' by his first Pentagon staff and 'Snowflakes' by the second, that Rumsfeld wrote during his time as a congressman and advisor to four different presidents, twice as United States Secretary of Defense. It also focuses on a response Rumsfeld gave to a question at a U.S. Department of Defense news briefing on February 12, 2002, about the lack of evidence linking the government of Iraq with the supply {{of weapons of mass destruction}} to <b>terrorist</b> groups. The <b>content</b> of the memos are varied, covering everything from the aftermath of Watergate, to the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, to the definition of the word [...] "terrorism". Morris returns to the motif of snowflakes swirling within a globe throughout the documentary as he discusses the memos with Rumsfeld, the contents of which the Defense Secretary allowed him limited access while preparing the film, and several of which Rumsfeld agrees to read aloud on camera.|$|R
40|$|Webpages with <b>terrorist</b> and extremist <b>content</b> are {{key factors}} in the {{recruitment}} and radicalization of disaffected young adults who may then engage in terrorist activities at home or fight alongside terrorist groups abroad. This paper reports on advances in techniques for classifying data collected by the Terrorism and Extremism Network Extractor (TENE) web-crawler, a custom-written program that browses the World Wide Web, collecting vast amounts of data, retrieving the pages it visits, analyzing them, and recursively following the links out of those pages. The textual content is subjected to enhanced classification through software analysis, using the Posit textual analysis toolset, generating a detailed frequency analysis of the syntax, including multi-word units and associated part-of-speech components. Results are then deployed in a knowledge extraction process using knowledge extraction algorithms, e. g., from the WEKA system. Indications are {{that the use of}} the data enrichment through application of Posit analysis affords a greater degree of match between automatic and manual classification than previously attained. Furthermore, the incorporation and deployment of these technologies promises to provide public safety officials with techniques that can help to detect terrorist webpages, gauge the intensity of their content, discriminate between webpages that do or do not require a concerted response, and take appropriate action where warranted...|$|R
