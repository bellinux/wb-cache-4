500|$|The {{player can}} play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and each {{character}} has advantages and disadvantages. For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick. Both characters can equip defensive weapons <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger {{and a special}} weapon that is exclusive to each of them: Jill can use a taser, while Chris is able to shove stun grenades into the zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot. Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Romm {{stated that}} [...] "Feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century {{in the face}} of a rapidly {{worsening}} climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced." [...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E

2500|$|From Eliade's perspective, Christianity's [...] "trans-historical message" [...] may be {{the most}} {{important}} help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book Mito ("Myth"), Italian researcher Furio Jesi argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience lies not in intellectually [...] "making history", but in man's experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade's perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man. In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events. Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> man from the [...] "Terror of history".|$|E

They resume their discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses {{to go along with}} it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe the books of the past have messages <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the [...] "parlor walls" [...] (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.|$|E
2500|$|A Working Kelpie {{can be a}} {{cheap and}} {{efficient}} worker <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from {{moving away from the}} stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross. [...] They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dogthey can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.|$|E
