5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With average returns during its first four weeks, the film eventually became an above-average grosser and its re-release was profitable. It has cult status in Telugu cinema, and is an acclaimed Prasad film. Goldstone Technologies announced that they would attempt <b>to</b> <b>digitise</b> the film in 2007, but abandoned the attempt three years later.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory <b>to</b> <b>digitise</b> the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights and anybody who wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

25|$|Despite Myanmar's {{possession}} of {{large amounts of}} historical material, many of the records have not been properly maintained, or used for research. The National Library of Myanmar holds 10,000 bundles of palm-leaf manuscripts, which have been collected from private donations and monasteries. Many more rolls of palm-leaf manuscripts remain uncollected, and are moldering in monasteries across the country without proper care as well as under attack by unscrupulous treasure hunters. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>digitise</b> the manuscripts have not materialised. Few have been studied systematically since the Burma Research Society closed the doors in 1980. The society had published the Journal of the Burma Research Society (JBRS) over (1300 articles in 59 volumes) between 1910 and 1980.|$|E

2500|$|The Victoria and Albert Museum's Word and Image Department {{was under}} the same {{pressure}} being felt in archives around the world, <b>to</b> <b>digitise</b> their collection. [...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol {{and to create a}} factory to completely digitise the collection. [...] The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. [...] The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. [...] Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. [...] 15,000 images were taken {{during the first year of}} the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. [...] The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. [...] All of those items which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. [...] The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. [...] There is a [...] "Search the Collections" [...] feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. [...] The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.|$|E

40|$|The {{convergence}} of the technologies of storage, delivery and presentation of text, data, image and sound {{have led to}} a demand for end-user access <b>to</b> <b>digitised</b> cultural resources.
