5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision for the government <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game.

Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT For nearly 20 years, Homeless International has {{supported}} inter-national partner organizations {{that work with}} slum communities to reduce poverty and improve living conditions. Its support has increasingly focused on partner organizations that {{are members of the}} Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI) network. The support has changed over time in response to the changing demands, but has increasingly been in the form of what Homeless International terms “fi nancial services ” – essentially, helping <b>partners</b> <b>to</b> access increased levels of capital to fi nance slum development projects on a growing scale. Homeless International now has a range of fi nancial services that it provides <b>to</b> <b>partners,</b> depending on their stage of development and consequent needs. These include the Community-Led Infrastructure Finance Facility (CLIFF), which currently provides large-scale venture capital grants <b>to</b> <b>partners</b> in three locations; a guarantee facility that can encourage and persuade local banks <b>to</b> lend <b>to</b> <b>partners</b> for slum development; and a new mechanism that heralds the start of Homeless International lending directly <b>to</b> <b>partners.</b> This profi le discusses only the fi nancial services work of Homeless International and not the broader activities of the organization. ...|$|R

5|$|Frank McLintock, a noted {{player for}} seven years for Leicester in a {{successful}} period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980. Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon Racing {{to take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the disclosure of HIV-positive serostatus <b>to</b> sexual <b>partners</b> by heterosexual and bisexual men, selected in centers for HIV/AIDS care. In 250 interviews, we investigated disclosure of serostatus <b>to</b> <b>partners,</b> correlating disclosure <b>to</b> characteristics of relationships. The focus group further explored barriers to maintenance/establishment of partnerships and their association with disclosure and condom use. Fear of rejection led to isolation and distress, thus hindering disclosure to current and new partners. Disclosure requires trust and was more frequent <b>to</b> steady <b>partners,</b> <b>to</b> <b>partners</b> who were HIV-positive themselves, <b>to</b> female <b>partners,</b> and by heterosexuals, occurring less frequently with commercial sex workers. Most interviewees reported consistent condom use. Unprotected sex was more frequent with seropositive <b>partners.</b> Suggestions <b>to</b> enhance comprehensive care for HIV-positive men included stigma management, group activities, and human rights-based approaches involving professional education in care for sexual health, disclosure, and care of "persons living with HIV"...|$|R
