5000|$|Lü Zhi's {{conservation}} work {{focuses on}} several large endangered species, including the giant panda, snow leopard, Przewalski's gazelle and the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear.</b> Her non-governmental organization (NGO), the Shanshui Conservation Center {{was founded in}} 2007 {{in order to help}} develop [...] "community-based, grassroots solutions to conservation in western China." [...] She emphasizes the importance of community-managed nature reserves in the fight to protect species and habitats, saying that these types of models are of benefit to both animals and sustainable use of the land by people. Lü Zhi hopes to see a [...] "new economic system that recognises and pays for the value of nature" [...] and at Shan Shui, they model these kinds of economic systems for the larger Chinese government. In addition to research and developing community-based conservation efforts, she has also worked with the Chinese government and businesses in order to develop more environmentally-friendly legislation and practices.|$|E

Unlike other countries where nuisance bears may be shot or relocated (Peine 2001, Gunther et al. 2004), China forbids these practices, and most hunting is forbidden.

Thus, despite their increasing threats to <b>Tibetan</b> communities, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> generally are safe from retaliatory killings by local villagers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tibetan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> Ursus arctos pruinosus in the Tibetan Plateau {{attack and}} kill {{livestock}} and ransack homes for food, causing significant economic costs for local herders. Although a government fund compensates herders for livestock lost to bear {{attacks in the}} Tibetan Autonomous Region (China), compensation may not reflect the real cost of losing livestock and payments can be delayed. We investigate whether bear-proof fences are a cost-effective method for reducing bear attacks and livestock losses. In January 2009, 14 bear-proof fences were constructed from wire mesh and steel posts around households which had previously experienced substantial losses to bear attacks in the Nagqu Prefecture of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. These households lost 162 animals to bears {{in the year before}} fence construction, whereas just three animals were lost in the year after fence construction. Fences were still standing 4. 8 years after completion and any small damage has been repaired by households. For households that suffer substantial losses to bear attacks, bear-proof fences appear to be an effective and cost-saving intervention to reduce human-bear conflict.

50|$|The diet of wild yaks {{consists}} {{largely of}} grasses and sedges, such as Carex, Stipa, and Kobresia. They also eat a smaller amount of herbs, winterfat shrubs, and mosses, and {{have even been}} reported to eat lichen. Historically, the main natural predator of the wild yak has been the <b>Tibetan</b> wolf, but <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and snow leopards have also been reported as predators in some areas, likely of young or infirm wild yaks.|$|R
40|$|The multiple-use Chang Tang and Seling Lake Nature Reserves {{were created}} in 1993 to protect the unique {{assemblage}} of large fauna inhabiting the high-altitude steppe grasslands of northern Tibet, including the Tibetan antelope, Tibetan wild ass, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> Tibetan Gazelle, wild yak, and snow leopard. Prior to creation of the reserve, many of these species were heavily hunted for meat and sale of parts. Since creation of the reserve, however, killing of wildlife by subsistence hunters and commercial poachers has declined while {{in the past five}} years a new problem has emerged, that of human-wildlife conflict. With human, livestock, and wildlife populations in the reserves all increasing, and animals apparently emboldened by reserve-wide hunting bans, all forms of human-wildlife conflict have surged rapidly since 2001. This conflict takes on four primary forms in the Chang Tang region: 1) killing of domestic livestock in corrals and on open pastures by Tibetan brown bears, snow leopards, and other predators, 2) Tibetan brown bears badly damaging herders' cabins and tents in search of food, 3) loss of important grass resources to large herd...|$|E
30|$|The book is {{organized}} into an Introduction and fourteen chapters, {{and includes a}} final Selected References of books and articles of direct relevance to the book, as well as very helpful Index. There are nine maps that assist in orienting the reader geographically to the topic being discussed. Eight chapters deal with the Chang Tang, the vast alpine steppe area of the northwestern Tibetan Plateau (about {{twice the size of}} the state of Montana), where Schaller much of his time conducting research on the Tibetan antelope, or chiru. In the chapter, Feral Naturalist, the author describes his evolution as a naturalist and is probably best summed up in the following sentences: ‘Whatever the explanation, I like to ramble over wild topography or sit quietly to watch an animal in its universe so different from mine. A naturalist basically wanders and observes. That is what I have loved to do as far back as memories take me.’ This chapter provides an interesting introspective on Schaller’s youth in Germany, his time in Alaska where studying at the University of Alaska opened the natural world to him, in which he has sojourned for over sixty years, and his early fieldwork in Africa with gorillas, in India on an ecological study of the tiger, in the Serengeti National Park on a study of lions, his work in Pakistan and Nepal in the 1970 s, and the panda project in China in the early 1980 s. Two chapters focus on southeast Tibet, a wild, mostly forested landscape of great diversity that still supports tigers. Here, the author also provides interesting information on the history of exploration in the area. The often disparaged pika, an important small mammal in Tibetan rangelands, is the focus of one chapter. Another chapter deals with the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> which is increasingly in conflict with Tibetan nomads. There is also a chapter on the snow leopard, the little-known cat of the Tibetan and Himalayan highlands that also preys on nomads’ livestock. One chapter deals with the Pamir, the rugged mountainous region located {{to the west of the}} Tibetan Plateau where the Marco Polo sheep is found. Here, Schaller describes his work in Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and China and the international cooperation that will be required to protect the ‘grandest of all wild sheep’.|$|E
50|$|In Central Asia, human {{disturbances}} {{are minimal}} as {{this area has}} a harsher environment and is more sparsely populated. In {{this part of the}} world, bears may be found in steppe, which is sparser and more desert-like than grassland habitats in North America that occur at similar latitudes, and some bears may live out their lives even in desert edge, such as those that live in the Middle East (Syrian bears) and the rare Gobi bear which is native only to the Chinese-Mongolian desert of its name and isolated from other populations. Alpine meadows are the typical habitat in the Himalayan and <b>Tibetan</b> populations of <b>brown</b> <b>bear.</b> In Siberia, the species seems well-adapted to living in almost all parts of the extensive pine forests, usually coming to waterways or poorly drained openings and bogs while feeding and sheltering in broad roots and trunks in the interior. Eastern Russian forests hold arguably the largest number of <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> in the world outside of possibly Alaska and northwestern Canada. The <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> of Hokkaido are also largely forest dwelling, but dwell in mixed forests dominated by broadleaf trees such as beech.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> usually {{dominate}} other bear {{species in}} areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black bears are at a competitive disadvantage to <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black <b>bears</b> by <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black <b>bears</b> by <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, {{as opposed to the}} <b>brown</b> <b>bear's</b> largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly bears, and especially where found near human habitations, American black bears may become to a larger extent nocturnal. <b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> may also kill Asian black bears, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. <b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian black bear, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Improbably, in the Himalayas, <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are reportedly intimidated by Asian black bears in confrontations. However, the Himalayan black bears are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the region's Himalayan <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> and the latter is one of the smaller races of <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> though still somewhat larger than the black bear. In Siberia, the opposite is true, and black bears are not known to attack people, but <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are. Both black bears seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens.|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} in interactions between <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and polar bears, theorized {{to be caused by}} climate change. <b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} genetic analysis, {{the evolutionary}} relationship between polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> (U. arctos) remains unclear. The two most recent comprehensive reports indicate a recent divergence with little subsequent admixture or {{a much more}} ancient divergence followed by extensive admixture. At {{the center of this}} controversy are the Alaskan ABC Islands <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> that show evidence of shared ancestry with polar bears. We present an analysis of genome-wide sequence data for seven polar bears, one ABC Islands <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> one mainland Alaskan <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> and a black bear (U. americanus), plus recently published datasets from other bears. Surprisingly, we find clear evidence for gene flow from polar bears into ABC Islands <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> but no evidence of gene flow from <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> into polar bears. Importantly, while polar bears contributed < 1 % of the autosomal genome of the ABC Islands <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> they contributed 6. 5 % of the X chromosome. The magnitude of sex-biased polar bear ancestry and the clear direction of gene flow suggest a model wherein the enigmatic ABC Island <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are the descendants of a polar bear population that was gradually converted into <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> via male-dominated <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> admixture. We present a model that reconciles heretofore conflicting genetic observations. We posit that the enigmatic ABC Islands <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> derive from a population of polar bears likely stranded by the receding ice {{at the end of the}} last glacial period. Since then, male <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> migration onto the island has gradually converted these bears into an admixed population whose phenotype and genotype are principally <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> except at mtDNA and X-linked loci. This process of genome erosion and conversion may be a common outcome when climate change or other forces cause a population to become isolated and then overrun by species with which it can hybridize...|$|R
40|$|Polar {{bears are}} an arctic, marine adapted species that {{is closely related}} to <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Genome {{analyses}} have shown that polar bears are distinct and genetically homogeneous in comparison to <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> However, these analyses have also revealed a remarkable episode of polar bear gene flow into the population of <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> that colonized the Admiralty, Baranof and Chichagof islands (ABC islands) of Alaska. Here, we present an analysis of data from a large panel of polar <b>bear</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> genomes that includes <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> from the ABC islands, the Alaskan mainland and Europe.

50|$|The {{evidence}} from DNA analysis is more complex. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{of the polar}} bear diverged from the <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> Ursus arctos, roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> as assessed by their mtDNA, are {{more closely related to}} polar bears than to other <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts. The mtDNA of extinct Irish <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> is particularly close to polar bears. A comparison of the nuclear genome of polar bears with that of <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> revealed a different pattern, the two forming genetically distinct clades that diverged approximately 603,000 years ago, although the latest research is based on analysis of the complete genomes (rather than just the mitochondria or partial nuclear genomes) of polar and <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> and establishes the divergence of polar and <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> at 400,000 years ago.|$|R

50|$|Several paleontologists {{suggest the}} {{possibility}} of two separate <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> migrations: inland <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> also known as grizzlies, are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska {{and the rest of}} the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. <b>Brown</b> <b>bear</b> fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.
