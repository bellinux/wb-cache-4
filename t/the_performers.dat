5|$|In 1841, {{disputes}} arose over Laporte's {{decision to}} replace the baritone Antonio Tamburini with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> formed a 'revolutionary conspiracy'.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>performer</b> {{is viewed}} from <b>the</b> side. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the {{beginning}} of the effect. At this point <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> may patter, saying something like, “You may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...". This is a reference to the Superman levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> whole body is clearly visible. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> legs may again be momentarily obscured. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> (particularly <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> clothing) and <b>the</b> area around <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> can be thoroughly examined.|$|R
50|$|After a {{while the}} sides of the box fall away to reveal <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> {{struggling}} to escape the manacles. Finally the saw drops before <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> has time to escape. The blade slices right through <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> body. <b>The</b> two halves of the table are rolled apart so that <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> is clearly separated into two sections. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> then appears to command the whole process to reverse: The body halves go back together, the saw rises, the box closes. Finally <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> emerges unharmed from the box.|$|R
40|$|Key presses of 1 monkey (called <b>the</b> <b>performer)</b> became <b>the</b> basis {{upon which}} a 2 nd monkey (called the judge) solved conditional-discrimination tasks. First, <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> {{was trained to}} press one of two colored choice keys (red or green) {{depending}} on {{the location of a}} white light in her chamber. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> key-pressing behavior was brought {{under the control of the}} experimenter by this procedure. Subsequently, the judge was trained to discriminate <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> key-pressing behavior. In Experiment 1, the judge had to press Key 1 when <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> pressed <b>the</b> red choice key and Key 2 when <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> pressed <b>the</b> green choice key. In Experiment 2, a sample key was introduced. The judge had to press Key 1 when <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> pressed <b>the</b> same colored choice key as the sample; the judge had to press Key 2 when <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> pressed <b>the</b> different colored choice key. In both experiments, the judge was required to attend to the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>performer.</b> It was shown that <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> behavior served as a discriminative stimulus for the judge's responses in a conditional-discrimination task...|$|R
5|$|Land Travel: The first segment {{focuses on}} land and cityscapes. Motorcycles and cars appear on the screens on the stage. Video of Cedar Point's roller coasters, {{including}} Millennium Force are played. <b>The</b> <b>performers</b> use umbrellas during a song in this segment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>performers</b> at {{the festival}} {{included}} Third Ear Band, Screw, King Crimson, Alexis Korner's New Church, Roy Harper, Battered Ornaments, Family and The Rolling Stones.|$|E
5|$|The pillars {{supporting}} the roof are named shitebashira (principal character's pillar), metsukebashira (gazing pillar), wakibashira (secondary character's pillar), and fuebashira (flute pillar), clockwise from upstage right respectively.

50|$|In 2004, {{the series}} was {{nominated}} for the following three Gemini Awards: Best Performance in a Pre-School Program or Series; Best Writing in a Childrens or Youth Program or Series; and Best Pre-School Program or Series. Nanalan won Best Writing and Best Performance, an award shared by Jamie Shannon (<b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Mona Bea), Jason Hopley (<b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Nana Bea), Marty Stelnick (<b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Mrs. Bea), Todd Doldersum (<b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Hank Wooka), and Ali Eisner (<b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Russell).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>performer</b> {{is viewed}} from <b>the</b> side. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> legs are {{commonly}} covered {{for a moment}} {{at the beginning of the}} effect, perhaps by a jacket. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> whole body is clearly visible. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground.

40|$|Computer {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} being used to assist coaches in sports coaching. There {{are two kinds of}} commercial sports training systems. 3 D motion-based systems acquire <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> 3 D motion using an expensive 3 D motion capture system in a constrained environment. <b>The</b> <b>performer’s</b> 3 D motion is then analyzed by the coach or compared with an existing 3 D reference motion of an expert by a computer system. 2 D video-based systems capture <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> motion in a single video and display the video beside a pre-recorded expert’s video. They do not analyze <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> video automatically but provide tools for the the coach or <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> to manually compare <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> motion with <b>the</b> expert’s motion. Therefore, these commercially available systems for sports coaching are either not affordable to general users, or do not perform detailed motion analysis automatically. The goal of this research is to develop an affordable and intelligent sports coaching system for general users. The system captures <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> motion using a single video camera. It automatically compares <b>the</b> <b>performer’s</b> motion with a pre-recorded expert’s 3 D motion. <b>The</b> <b>performer’s</b> motion and <b>the</b> expert’s motion may differ in time (e. g. ...|$|R
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> and the audience.|$|E
5|$|However, von Rhein {{notes that}} the theater's size poses a {{challenge}} to <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. In 2009–2010, the theater introduced a pair of discounted ticket programs: a five dollar lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a discounted ten dollar ticket program was initiated for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.|$|E
5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{employed}} {{noise in}} vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962–64/69), {{in which the}} four choirs clap their hands, talk, and shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds {{as well as to}} incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by <b>the</b> <b>performers.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>performer</b> {{stands at}} an angle facing away from <b>the</b> spectators. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. The effect {{generally}} does not last {{for more than five}} seconds. <b>The</b> <b>performer's</b> feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete.|$|R
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> {{from the}} {{original}} album returned for the sequel. Roy Bittan performed keyboard and piano on most tracks, with Todd Rundgren, Ellen Foley, Rory Dodd and Kasim Sulton returning to provide background vocals. Meat Loaf and the musicians are credited as co-arrangers, and Bittan and long-term Steinman collaborator Steven Rinkoff are credited as associate producers. The album was mixed by David Thoener {{with the exception of}} the final track, which was mixed by Rinkoff.|$|E
5|$|Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry), {{representing}} the Queen, arrived with the President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge. The London Symphony Orchestra and the Urban Voice Choir performed {{the national anthem}} of the United Kingdom whilst the Union flag was raised by {{the armed forces and}} <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> waved mini Union flags in the stadium. Once the flag was raised Hirst's artwork was revealed as the grey clouds were removed.|$|E
5|$|The Theatregoers' Choice Award is {{organized}} by leading theater website Whatsonstage.com and honors <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> and productions of British theater {{with emphasis on}} London's West End. Madonna has won Theater Event of the Year for her role on the London West End theatre version of the play Up for Grabs.|$|E
50|$|The rolling globe is {{a circus}} skill in which <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> {{balances}} atop a large sphere, sometimes taller than <b>the</b> <b>performer.</b> Various gymnastic or juggling stunts may be performed while <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> moves and controls {{the position of}} the ball with the feet and/or hands.|$|R
40|$|Story telling session; {{traditional}} narrative (akinhá) >truthful story (akinha ekugu). Local: Kuikuro {{village at}} Ipatse (Terra Indígena do Xingu, Upper Xingu; Mato Grosso, Brazil).

5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off <b>the</b> <b>performers,</b> who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>performers</b> {{were allowed}} to improvise {{provided}} that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium. When he joined the troupe in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to <b>the</b> <b>performers.</b> Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E

5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted {{with the spirit of}} Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by <b>the</b> <b>performers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed {{as a threat to the}} regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>performer</b> {{is portrayed}} at many {{different}} stages in life, from childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood, and travels through his personal timeline, from past, to present, to future. Many other characters from <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> life are mentioned, and sometimes briefly mimicked, {{but only as}} they relate to the stories of <b>the</b> <b>performer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A costumed {{character}} wears {{a costume}} that usually (but not always) covers <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> face. These range from theme park [...] "walk-around" [...] or [...] "meetable" [...] characters, the mascots of corporations, schools, or sports teams to novelty act performers. Some costumes cover <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> face; others, {{especially those in}} theme parks, may leave <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> face visible.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} is typically made {{of metal and}} is cylindrical. Inside the cylinder {{is a type of}} fan-blade which, when <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> blows through one end, spins and creates the sound. <b>The</b> faster <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> blows, <b>the</b> faster the fan-blade moves and the higher the pitch the instrument creates. Conversely, <b>the</b> slower <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> blows, <b>the</b> lower the pitch.|$|R
