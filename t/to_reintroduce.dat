5|$|Native American {{raids on}} {{frontier}} settlements escalated {{in the spring}} and summer of 1764. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia, where more raids occurred on July 26, when four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Congress {{directed}} Amtrak {{to study}} resumption of service, which rekindled hope of restoration. Amtrak published a feasibility study in October 2009, which proposed restoring the North Coast Hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule. Amtrak projected a yearly ridership of 359,800, {{some of whom}} would {{be drawn from the}} Empire Builder. Amtrak estimated that $1 billion in funds would be necessary to relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock. The corporation estimated it would take four to five years <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> the service if a decision was made to move forward.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E

5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete {{the account of the}} descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} {{previous}} volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, The Red Sea Sharks was created {{with the aid of}} Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Hergé used the story as a vehicle in which <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier installments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world, however in the 1960s the story would generate controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Red Sea Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Mint {{had begun}} to strike {{copper-nickel}} clad coins instead of silver, due to rises in bullion prices. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, and none, initially, were minted in the new metal. Beginning in 1969, legislators sought <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died in March of that year, {{there were a number}} of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing the new coin on December 31, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, the PL {{board of}} {{directors}} agreed <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> a playoff system {{to be used for}} the 2004 NPB season. If a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings nearing the end of the regular season, there was no pennant (league champion) race and little excitement until the Japan Series began. The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league's popularity. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second final stage. The Final Stage winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's Climax Series champion team.|$|E
5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>reintroduce</b> the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
