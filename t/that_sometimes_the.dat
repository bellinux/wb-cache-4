5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|To avoid pressure, Jackson hired a {{different}} editor for each film. John Gilbert {{worked on the}} first film, Mike Horton and Jabez Olssen on the second and longtime Jackson collaborator Jamie Selkirk and Annie Collins on the third. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, with scenes being done throughout 1999–2002 for the rough (4½ hours) assemblies of the films. In total, 1828km (six million feet) of film was edited down to the 11 hours and 23minutes (683minutes) of Extended running time. This was the final area of shaping of the films, when Jackson realised <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> best scripting could be redundant on screen, as he picked apart scenes every day from multiple takes.|$|E

5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E

The only significant disadvantage of using the Janney design is <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> drawheads need to be manually aligned.

500|$|Dawson {{includes}} excerpts and {{quotes from}} Brooke's letters within her fictional passages, integrating both elements {{to create a}} complete narrative. In fact many of the comments made by Nell observing Brooke are actually comments made by his contemporaries. This style of integrating fact and fiction is similar to Dawson's previous novel Fred and Eddie. The integration of these facts is nearly seamless. However, in interpreting Edwardian language, Dawson misuses the term [...] "pump ship" [...] according to Frances Spalding in The Independent. Critic Simon Akam noted <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> recreation of Brooke's language affects Nell's language, making her comments more poetic then her usual dialect.|$|E
500|$|Modern writers also {{question}} {{the idea that}} White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book Dynamic Chess Strategy, rejects {{the notion that the}} initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, [...] "Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. If you try to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous counter-attack." [...] Rowson and Watson concur. Watson also observes, [...] "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|The track {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to {{the style of}} 808s & Heartbreak, a studio album by rapper Kanye West noted for its jarring use of auto-tune. West has often been noted as an influence by Ocean. Ology writer Terron R. Moore mused that unlike West, Ocean was [...] "an inherently sad guy" [...] and that feeling of inner loss and hopelessness appears on every track on the album, even when he's supposed to be singing about the [...] "Sweet Life". He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often {{is not the best}} choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took on the role of a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, when you got the beach?" [...] he asks rhetorically. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail stated that the track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure, of [...] "keepin’ it surreal" [...] with pills and sunshine, in music that’s supposedly all about feeling good.|$|E

[...] Work on the conjecture improved understanding of 3-manifolds. [...] Experts in the field were often reluctant to announce proofs, and tended to view any such announcement with skepticism.

2500|$|The poet-folklorist Jesse Glass joined Shaver's Atlantean Library in {{the early}} 1970s {{as a young man}} and briefly corresponded with him. He was {{intrigued}} by Shaver's [...] "rock books" [...] with their accompanying descriptions, but noted <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> surfaces of the stones seemed to be treated in some manner. One piece of stone looked like the surface was actually a drawing or rubbing on paper that had been heavily shellacked or somehow glued on. In fact, bits of white paper seemed to be showing through the shellac. Glass corresponded with Shaver and found him to be an intelligent and well-read correspondent until one day, out of the blue, the letters took on an abusive tone. It was then that Glass ended the correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|The problem mostly {{stemmed from}} the feature of modern oil patterns, {{especially}} house patterns that help exhibit performance of modern bowling balls allegedly for marketing reasons. Every such pattern provides better odds to bowlers with certain line of bowling, release, ball speed and certain type of bowling balls. If a bowler has a specific form of bowling suitable for a specific oil pattern, coupled with the right bowling ball, his margin of error is highly increased versus other bowlers. The result is <b>that</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> bowler throwing the more accurate shot loses to the bowler who has created a larger [...] "target area". Some advanced bowlers simplified this to: [...] "To a large degree, the equipment and oil pattern determines the winner." ...|$|E
