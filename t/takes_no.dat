5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E

25|$|File and use: Insurers set rates, {{but they}} cannot be charged until the {{regulator}} has been notified and allowed time {{to review and}} action, if necessary. In some prior-approval states, almost the same result is achieved through a so-called deemer provision.

The Circus orders his return to London, not via Hong Kong. Westerby <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> notice and goes to Hong Kong. At his flat he finds the corpse of Luke, his photojournalist friend, who has been shot because the killer thought he was Westerby.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed {{a lawsuit}} against the American Red Cross (ARC), {{demanding}} that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes. In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.|$|E

25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} an {{attempted}} reconstruction of the original melody by Suzanne Haïk-Vantoura, {{on the basis of}} the shapes and positions of the marks and without any reference to existing melodies, as described in her book La musique de la Bible révélée and her records. That reconstruction assumes the signs represent the degrees of various musical scales, that is individual notes, which puts it at odds with all existing traditions where the signs invariably represent melodic motives; it also <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> account of the existence of older systems of notation, such as the Babylonian and Palestinian systems. Musicologists have rejected her results as dubious and her methodology as flawed.|$|E
25|$|This {{introductory}} section {{has focused}} on the spacetime of special relativity, since it is the easiest to describe. Minkowski spacetime is flat, <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> account of gravity, is uniform throughout, and serves as nothing more than a static background for the events that take place in it. The presence of gravity greatly complicates the description of spacetime. In general relativity, spacetime is no longer a static background, but actively interacts with the physical systems that it contains. Spacetime curves in the presence of matter, can propagate waves, bends light, and exhibits a host of other phenomena. A few of these phenomena are described in the later sections of this article.|$|E

25|$|Nil: A {{player that}} has already looked at their cards can bid Nil. The object of the bidder is to take no tricks during the hand. The player's partner may make a normal bid and then help them by {{attempting}} to take tricks the Nil bidder would otherwise take. In solo/cutthroat spades, successful Nil bids are rare {{since there is no}} partner to help by taking the bidder's higher cards. If the Nil bidder <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> tricks, he receives the Nil bonus; if unsuccessful, the player or team subtracts that bonus. More than one player (opponents or teammates in partners) may bid Nil on a deal.|$|E
25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as {{a quality}} of all {{existing}} objects (and of the material world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to them. Our consciousness of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in a meaningless flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his own existence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … <b>takes</b> <b>no</b> time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
