5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve.

5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world.</b> Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like silver-plated design in contrast to the traditional buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot is then portrayed {{through the}} eyes of Ramza Beoulve, who is the player {{character}} of the story.

5|$|Last Exile {{is set on}} <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Prester. Prester's {{two nations}} of Anatoray and Disith are {{separated}} by a turbulent region of the sky known as the Grand Stream and are engaged in eternal conflict according to the code of chivalric warfare. A superior faction known as the Guild enforces these rules. It also provides the two nations with technology but, unknown to them, has dishonorable intentions, to preserve {{the status quo and}} enforce its dominance of both sides. Although the story is set in the future, the technology employed differs from that in a typical space opera. Instead, the show's retro-futuristic dieselpunk setting resembles nineteenth-century Europe {{at the height of the}} Industrial Revolution. Inhabitants of Prester operate aerial vehicles known as vanships in the world's Golden Age of Aviation; although the technology is primitive, the aerial vehicles use a form of antigravity (developed by the Guild) and lighter-than-air methods of flight rather than the use of wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around Kirby, the series' protagonist, and his adventures in <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Pop Star. A common gameplay element is Kirby's ability to copy enemy skills, {{allowing him to}} use them to progress through levels. This and other changes in gameplay from traditional platform games distinguish the series from other entries in the genre. Currently, the series contains twenty games. A one-hundred episode anime series based on the video games, , was created in Japan and formerly distributed by 4Kids TV in North America. A special 101st episode was created for the now retired Nintendo Video service, and was not in the anime style of the original 100 episodes. The Kirby series is among the best-selling video game franchises with over twenty million games sold worldwide. The franchise was conceived by Masahiro Sakurai as a game series for beginners, for which he partially attributes the series' success.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien's prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as {{given the}} {{existence}} of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams' Watership Down and Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, accepts readers into <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world,</b> rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality. While The Hobbit is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children's and Anglo-Saxon literature), has his own linguistic style separate {{from those of the}} main characters.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{takes place}} in <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Hydaelyn, a planet filled with {{multiple}} environments and climates covering three large continents. The region in which the game is set is called Eorzea. The four major city-states in Eorzea feature {{a wide variety of}} climates and biomes: the forest nation of Gridania is surrounded by a dense thicket called the Black Shroud; Ul'dah is a sultanate with a predilection for commerce situated in the Thanalan Desert; the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa finds its home in La Noscea on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard is a theocracy built in the snowy mountains of Coerthas. Eorzea is connected to a larger continent to the northeast which has largely been conquered by the militaristic Garlean Empire. Other political entities include the beastmen tribes who perennially assault the civilized nations; Sharlayan, a scholarly city to the northwest; and Ala Mhigo, a city-state which was occupied during the first Garlean invasion twenty years prior to the events of the game. The four major city-states formed the Eorzean Alliance to repel this invasion but Ishgard abruptly withdrew, leaving the remaining three allies in name only. This conflict also resulted in the desolation of Mor Dhona, a once-vibrant region {{in the center of the}} continent that is now a barren wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana {{is set in}} <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, {{the giver}} of mana and life for the world, burned down almost entirely nine centuries prior {{to the events of}} the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, {{controlled}} by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player.|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the work of Josef Škvorecký as a whole. In doing this, we aim to define {{specific}} plot sequences, narrative techniques, recurrent motifs etc. Simultaneously, the relations between single texts become clearer. The author offers a possible <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> in each of his literary pieces. However, their perspectives often coalesce while the author deliberately alludes to events and occurrences known from his previous books, giving the reader a chance to link the items of <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> together. Using identical or very similar singularities, the author creates an "intertextual literary world", a self-contained macrocosm of sorts that should be as homogenous as possible. His plots have constant settings; his books include the same characters, his topic sequences are similar etc. ¨ Obviously, Škvorecký attempts to create a homogenous macrocosm consisting of his texts. Bearing that in mind, we nevertheless regard every Škvoreckýs work as a self-contained <b>fictional</b> <b>world.</b> This approach is shown in the thesis e. g. on the motif of Kostelec as the hometown of different characters named Danny Smiřický. Each Danny is a specific singularity; we can follow their different perspectives in <b>the</b> <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> of single texts. Certain lines of the characters development are closer, such as [...] ...|$|R
