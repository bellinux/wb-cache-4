5|$|Flexing the <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> {{feet and}} {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the usefulness of arch pads as a conservative treatment for floating toe. The subjects were 21 female junior high school students with floating <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> no diseases of the foot. The floating toes were <b>toes</b> 4 <b>and</b> 5. Arch pads {{were placed in the}} regulation indoor school shoes, and the results examined. The use of arch pads improved floating toe in the static upright posture. During walking, there were significant increases in the load on the <b>toes,</b> walking speed, <b>and</b> stride length. Lateral longitudinal arch pads caused <b>toes</b> 4 <b>and</b> 5 to bend. These findings suggest that inserting an insole into the shoes of people with floating toe increases the load on the toes, thus improving floating <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> giving better gait motion. Furthermore, lateral longitudinal arch pads are useful for people with floating toe involving <b>toes</b> 4 <b>and</b> 5...|$|R

5|$|Gould became {{widely known}} through his popular essays on {{evolution}} in the Natural History magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled This View of Life (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species) starting from January 1974 and ended in January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's <b>Toes,</b> <b>and</b> The Flamingo's Smile.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> showed that their range of motion was compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used this ability to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E

5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> each hindlimb five.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} <b>toes,</b> <b>and</b> supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> nails.|$|E

5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E
