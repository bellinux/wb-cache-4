5|$|During 2005, the British Museum {{presented}} Egypt with a full-sized {{replica of}} the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, close to <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months {{for the opening of}} the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused.|$|E
5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E

5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD.

Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> helmet was discovered, which was located {{a few miles away}} from a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton and Thomas Ogden, the {{schoolmaster}} at the adjacent church school in 1874 as Christ Church F.C. It was initially run from {{the church of the}} same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.|$|E
5|$|The one militia man {{killed in}} battle, Thomas Jefferson Short, was later buried somewhere on <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> battle occurred. The battle was devastating for Black Hawk and his band, {{despite the fact}} that much of his band escaped across the Wisconsin River; {{casualty}} estimates were as high as 70 dead Sauk and Fox, including those killed in action and those drowned. Even so, at least one source called the battle, along with Stillman's Run, one of Black Hawk's major military triumphs.|$|E

5|$|During 2009, Steven Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{published}} two papers that found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which {{can be found in a}} single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, Goodman and Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (<b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. Among the five species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from the eastern edge of the Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar. Two specimens of M.manavi differed by 1.3% in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2.5% from M.petersoni.|$|E
