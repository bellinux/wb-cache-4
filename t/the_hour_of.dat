25|$|The {{writers of}} the Middle Ages have sought for other mystical {{explanations}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Nones. Amalarius of Metz (III, vi) explains at length how, like the sun which sinks on the horizon at <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> Nones, man's spirit tends to lower itself also, he is more open to temptation, {{and it is the}} time the demon selects to try him. For the texts of the Fathers on this subject it will suffice to refer the reader to the above-mentioned work of Cardinal Bona (c. ix). The same writers do not fail to remark that the number nine was considered by the ancients an imperfect number, an incomplete number, ten being considered perfection and the complete number. Nine was also the number of mourning. Among the ancients the ninth day was a day of expiation and funeral servicenovemdiale sacrum, the origin doubtless of the novena for the dead. As for the ninth hour, some persons believe that it is the hour at which our first parents were driven from the Garden of Paradise. In conclusion, it is necessary to call attention to a practice which emphasized <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Nonesit was <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fasting. At first, <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fasting was prolonged to Vespers, that is to say, food was taken only in the evening or {{at the end of the}} day. Mitigation of this rigorous practice was soon introduced. Tertullian's famous pamphlet De jejunio rails at length against the Psychics (i.e. the orthodox Christians) who end their fast on station days at <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Nones, while he, Tertullian, claims that he is faithful to the ancient custom. The practice of breaking the fast at Nones caused that hour to be selected for Mass and Communion, which were the signs of the close of the day. The distinction between the rigorous fast, which was prolonged to Vespers, and the mitigated fast, ending at Nones, is met with in a large number of ancient documents (see Fasting).|$|E
