40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{the mandate of the}} European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), {{established}} in 2007, {{from the perspective of the}} Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which entered into force in 2009. It explores the relationship between FRA and the Charter by looking at the agency’s institutional practice, its founding regulation and its Multiannual Framework, on which the Council of the European Union agrees every five years. The Florence-based European University Institute (EUI) proposed some 15 years ago an European Union (EU) human rights agenda for the new millennium. Many of the agenda’s policy proposals have materialised ever since, including the establishment of a ‘European Human Rights Monitoring Agency’. The Charter was not part of this set of proposals. However, this prominent bill of rights and the new Agency in Vienna are obviously closely related to each other. The author concludes that the agency, despite certain limitations in its mandate, is a ‘full-Charter-body’ which could unfold its potential better following a revision of its founding regulation. Such a revision should reflect that the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights has entered into force in the meantime. The author identifies two additional key elements for the need of revision: FRA’s mandate should include the possibility for the agency <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>opinions</b> on proposed EU legislation on its own motion, and the agency should autonomously adopt its multiannual priorities...|$|E

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} data {{analysis}} methods {{were applied to}} the retrospective survey data collected by Morita, Shimizu, and Funaba (2012) to determine which university education programs and activities influence the　alumni’s job performance. The result by correspondence analysis among university programs and activities　and the fundamental competencies for working persons defined by the Japanese Ministry of Economy,　Trade and Industry (2007) indicated the following four clusters: (1) seminar and one’s ability <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b>　<b>opinions</b> clearly, to analyze the status quo, and to clarify issues; (2) curriculum and one’s foreign language　ability; (3) extra-curricular activities and one’s ability to listen carefully to others’ opinions and to influence and involve others; and (4) one’s activities outside university {{and the ability to}} create new values. The causal relationships among the actual degrees of curricular and extra-curricular activities in university, the utility of such activities in university life, and the three factors extracted from the responses to the questions of the fundamental competencies were also analyzed by the path analysis method. Activities outside university affected most significantly the alumni’s ability to solve issues, while a few activities related to university life affected their ability to collaborate with various people and to manage stress. The methodological issues with the alumni survey were also discussed along with the implications of these findings. 大学における教育プログラムと活動が，卒業生の仕事の遂行に与える影響について明らかにするために，森田・清水・船場（ 2011 ）によって収集された回想的調査データに 2 種類の分析方法論を適用した。経済産業省（ 2007 ）によって定義された社会人基礎力と大学におけるプログラム，活動の関係についての対応分析による結果から，以下の 4 クラスタが得られた：⑴ゼミと自分の意見を分かりやすく伝える力，現状を分析し課題を明らかにする力，⑵講義と語学力，⑶正課外活動と相手の意見を丁寧に聴く力，他人に働きかけ巻き込む力，そして，⑷学外での活動と新しい価値を生み出す力，である。大学の正課・正課外活動，大学生活における幾つかの活動の有用性，そして基礎能力についての質問項目から抽出された 3 つの因子の因果関係について，パス解析による分析を行った。学外での活動は，課題解決力に対して最も有意に影響していた。大学生活における少数の活動が対人関係力，ストレス耐性力に影響していた。卒業生調査における方法論的問題とこれらの知見について考察を行った...|$|E
40|$|Speaking is an {{important}} skill {{that needs to be}} mastered as it {{is the best way to}} communicate with other people in order <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>opinions</b> and express ideas, but the fact is that secondary school students’ ability in speaking English is low in Malaysia. It is caused by several factors such as lack of vocabulary, poor pronunciation, weak grammar and poor fluency that hinders the mastery of English language. In this research, Oral Proficiency in English for Secondary Schools (OPS-English) Programme was employed to improve students’ speaking skill by engaging them in vocabulary based activities. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of OPS-English in improving the students speaking skills and increasing their vocabulary count. This is an experimental pretest-posttest control group design study which involved 70 students from a school located in one of the districts in Kedah, Malaysia.  The duration of the study was 8 weeks. The data collection was done using pre-test and post-test. The data from the pre-test and post-test was analysed quantitatively using independent sample test. The findings of this study show that OPS-English can improve students’ vocabulary. This is proven by experimental group’s students’ test score that showed improvement in the post-test. OPS-English is a suitable programme that should be used to improve students’ vocabulary. The result of this study provides useful insights for English language teachers in teaching speaking.
