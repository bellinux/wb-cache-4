5000|$|Duncanson, {{as major}} of Argyll's foot regiment, {{was second in}} command to Lieutenant-colonel James Hamilton, who had the {{planning}} of the Glencoe massacre. On 12 February 1692, Hamilton received orders to execute the fatal commission from Colonel John Hill. He directed Duncanson to proceed immediately with four hundred of his men to Glencoe {{in order to reach}} the post which had been assigned him by five o'clock the following morning, at which hour Hamilton promised to reach another post with a party of Hill's regiment. Whether Duncanson hesitated to take an active personal part in the massacre is matter of conjecture. Dr. James Browne says: [...] "The probability is, that he felt some repugnance to act in person", as immediately on receipt of Hamilton's order he despatched another order from himself to Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, who had already taken up his quarters in Glencoe, with instructions to fall upon the Macdonalds precisely at five o'clock the following morning, and put all to the sword under seventy years of age: You are to have a speciall care, that the old fox and his sone doe on no acct escape yor hands. Yow're to secure all the avenues that none escape; this yow are to put in execution at 5 a cloack precisly, and by that time, or verie shortly efter it, I'll strive to be at yow wt a stronger party. If I do not come to yow at 5, yow are not to <b>tarie</b> for me, but to fall on. [...] The severity of the weather prevented Duncanson from reaching the glen till eleven o'clock, six hours after the slaughter, so that {{he had nothing to do}} but to assist in burning the houses and carrying off the cattle.|$|E

There are several methods of liquid cooling, notables include: immersion, cold water cooling, and warm water cooling. The total cost of ownership is difficult to determine with these options as each has a different impact on the data center. Considering retrofit, over a new data center, introduces unforeseen variables that make cost analysis a challenge. Besides the added costs of additional infrastructure, and the cost to remove old, the upfront costs could be daunting. Therefore a cost analysis would be a study of its won. This study however hopes to reveal the resulting tradeoffs in temperature, performance, and power usage presented in the case between classical airflow based heat sink mechanisms to water provided directly at the heatsink. Having control over a discrete chiller will provide answers to the CPU temperatures, power usage, and performance at various inlet water temperatures.
