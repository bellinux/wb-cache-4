Connor writes <b>that</b> <b>cool</b> is the silent and knowing rejection of racist oppression, a self-dignified expression of masculinity developed by black men denied mainstream expressions of manhood. She writes that mainstream perception of cool is narrow and distorted, with cool often perceived merely as style or arrogance, rather than a way to achieve respect.|$|E

500|$|Cool World {{opened at}} sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its {{lifetime}} gross was $14.1 million, {{a little more}} than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 45 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote <b>that</b> <b>Cool</b> World [...] "misses one opportunity after another", describing it as [...] "a surprisingly incompetent film". Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as [...] "a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny." [...] Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "too serious to be fun [...] too goofy to take seriously", and the lead characters as [...] "unlikable and unappealing". The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered [...] "whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person," [...] and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all advertising support after the opening weekend.|$|E
500|$|Downes {{said that}} his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written {{character}} description provided, which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words. In a podcast interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, {{he was given a}} fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the games, Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as [...] "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [...] apply their own personality." [...] Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as [...] "pretty much the consummate professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's <b>that</b> <b>cool</b> he doesn't need her." [...] Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in Halo: The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media. Alternatively, William C. Dietz's portrayal of the Chief in [...] was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund's template.|$|E

500|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Viñes, S.J., introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. [...] Forecasting hurricane motion was based on tide movements, as well as cloud and barometer changes over time. [...] In 1895, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>cool</b> conditions with unusually high pressure preceded tropical cyclones in the West Indies by several days. [...] Before the early 1900s, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph. [...] It was not until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. [...] Despite the issuance of hurricane watches and warnings for systems threatening the coast, forecasting the path of tropical cyclones did not occur until 1920. [...] By 1922, it was known that the winds at [...] to [...] in height above the sea surface within the storms' right front quadrant were representative of a storm's steering, and that hurricanes tended to follow the outermost closed isobar of the subtropical ridge.|$|E

Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album, Milian collaborated with only one team of producers, which made for a greater representation of a [...] "more mature, settled" [...] Milian.

Milian felt <b>that</b> <b>Cool</b> & Dre brought their own style of beats to the album, giving it a [...] "raw feel" [...] and [...] "street credibility".

500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn't know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like <b>that</b> <b>cool</b> to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E
