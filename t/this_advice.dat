5|$|After {{making a}} duck {{in the first}} innings of the match between Tasmania and the touring Australian side in March 1930, members of the Australian side advised Nash to change his stance, stating {{that it was too}} unorthodox to be successful. Nash ignored <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> and {{promptly}} scored 93 in the second innings of the match.|$|E
5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. <b>This</b> <b>advice</b> touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops {{led by the}} comte de Rochambeau {{arrived at}} Newport, Rhode Island {{to aid in the}} war. French naval forces then landed, led by Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. At first Washington hoped to bring the allied fight to New York and to end the war there, but Rochambeau advised de Grasse that Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target. Admiral de Grasse {{followed}} <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> and arrived off the Virginia coast. Washington immediately saw the advantage created, made a feinting move with his force towards Clinton in New York, and then headed south to Virginia.|$|E

60|$|Following out <b>this</b> courageous <b>advice,</b> Berridge, {{after hitting}} three {{boundaries}} {{in his first}} two overs, was stumped half-way through the third.|$|R
5|$|The French infantry—mostly Gascons—had {{meanwhile}} {{started down}} the slope towards Sanseverino. Montluc, noting that the disorder of the Italians had forced them to a standstill, suggested that De Tais attack Madruzzo's advancing column of landsknechte instead; <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> was accepted, and the French formation turned left {{in an attempt to}} strike the landsknechte in the flank. Madruzzo responded by splitting his column into two separate portions, one of which moved to intercept the French while the other continued up the slope towards the Swiss waiting at the crest.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had both}} political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official inquiry into the disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as {{it would not be}} possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> and no inquiry was ever held.|$|E
5|$|The first subplot {{involves}} the courtship of Mary Lowther, {{a childhood friend}} of the vicar's wife. Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls deeply in love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore is a good man, but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage. In the face of <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> she does not reject Gilmore outright, but asks for time to consider.|$|E

5|$|David told Scott-James {{that she}} planned to publish the {{articles}} as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called A Book of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E

5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{accepted}} the RAAF's recommendation, and delayed its decision on a MirageIII replacement until late 1981. This gave General Dynamics {{an opportunity to}} offer the improved F-16C to the RAAF. The capability of these aircraft was closer {{to that of the}} F-18 as they were equipped with BVR missiles. Richardson and another RAAF pilot test-flew F-16Cs in May 1981. The F-18 design was also improved during 1981, and was redesignated the F/A-18. When RAAF test pilots flew these aircraft during 1981, they found that the deficiencies they had detected in 1980 were now addressed. Overall, the RAAF concluded that while both aircraft met its requirements and the F-16 was less expensive, the F/A-18 was the superior design as it was more technologically mature, easier to maintain during operational deployments, and likely to have a much lower attrition rate. The Government accepted <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> and announced on 20 October 1981 that 75 F/A-18s would be ordered. As part of this announcement, Minister for Defence Jim Killen acknowledged that the F-16 would have been seven percent cheaper to purchase, but stated that the F/A-18's lower running costs and expected attrition rate greatly reduced the difference between the lifetime cost of the two designs.|$|E
5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes <b>this</b> <b>advice,</b> but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

5|$|Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) {{returns home}} from {{boarding}} school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption {{and the reason}} why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and her younger sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school functin, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother.|$|E

25|$|Though this {{declaration}} {{was never}} enforced (like the Constitution of 1793), history {{has shown that}} the French people have followed <b>this</b> <b>advice</b> with many successful (1830, 1848) and unsuccessful (1832, 1870) revolutions throughout the 19th century.|$|E
