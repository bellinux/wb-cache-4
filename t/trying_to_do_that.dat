500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that...</b> I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E

60|$|They all <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but no {{practical}} idea seemed forthcoming.|$|R
60|$|We {{began to}} talk about my aunt's losses, and I told them what I had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph!" [...] {{suddenly}} cried Mrs. Cliff, [...] "don't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The thing may break under you, {{and nobody}} knows what you would fall into. Come down." ...|$|R
60|$|He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if {{you were}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for a week on end you couldn't. Chance. We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, with a quivering sigh; [...] "it must be hateful to him." [...] She paused, {{and then she}} rushed on with bitter self-reproach. [...] "And I--I have helped to make it so! O Mrs. Bowen, perhaps it's I who have been trifling with him Trying to make him believe--no, not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but letting him see that I sympathised--Oh, do you think I have?" ...|$|E
60|$|Armand {{took it from}} him, and {{sat down}} close to the table; leaning forward he held the paper near the light, and began to read. He read the letter through very slowly to the end, then once again from the beginning. He was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which Chauvelin had wished to do an hour ago; {{he was trying to}} find the inner meaning which he felt must inevitably lie behind these words which Percy had written with his own hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{this is an}} all-right show," [...] remarked Giant, after {{witnessing}} some particularly thrilling bareback riding. [...] "I wouldn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> trick {{on horseback}} for a thousand dollars." ...|$|R
5000|$|We want {{to master}} the Internet. That is a {{challenge}} that no one institution — be it ours or the National Security Agency, NSA, for that matter — can manage on their own. We <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in conjunction with our allies. John Adams ...|$|R
5000|$|There's an old Wayne Gretzky {{quote that}} I love. [...] "I skate {{to where the}} puck is going to be, not where it has been." [...] And we've always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> at Apple. Since the very, very beginning. And we always will.|$|R
6000|$|Obedient to the {{slightest}} wish of this dear creature, I went twice around the cave, devouring the sandwiches as I walked. They {{were the most}} delicious food that I had ever tasted. They were {{given to me by}} Agnes. I came back to the opening. I could not immediately begin my avowal. I must ask a question first. [...] "Can they get to me?" [...] I inquired. [...] "Is anybody <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Are they working there by you? I do not hear them at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{hit in the}} body, sure enough," [...] the man said, [...] "for {{there is}} a bullet hole through your cuirass, and your jerkin below it is all stained with blood. You have been hit in the left arm too, and the blood is frozen to the ground; but we will soon free that for you. But before <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we will cut open the sleeve of your jerkin and bandage your arm, or the {{movement}} may set it off bleeding again, and you have lost {{a pool of blood}} already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be no}} use <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> They will {{guard the}} {{entrance}} gates, give the alarm, and set all the priests on duty in the temple in search. No, come along quickly. They cannot be {{sure that it is}} we who spoke to them, and will probably wait until one has ascended the stairs to see that no one is lurking there. I think we are safe for the moment; but there are no good hiding-places. I think you had better walk straight to the entrance, Chebron. Your presence here is natural enough, and those they post at the gates would let you pass out without suspicion. I will try and find myself a hiding-place." ...|$|E
5000|$|Russia's culture {{minister}} Vladimir Medinsky {{stated that}} [...] "It is my deep conviction {{that even if}} this story was invented from the start to the finish ..., it is a sacred legend which it’s simply impossible to besmirch. And people who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> are total scumbags." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jay Leno led the April 16 {{show off}} by sending prayers and best wishes to {{everyone}} affected. [...] He stated that {{his job was}} to end the day on a happy note, and be a little silly, and he was going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for everyone on that day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have now}} been for some time {{out of the way}} of this kind of work, but I hope that all may be safely ordered for us. It is all in His hands; and you all feel, as I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> there should be no cause for anxiety or trouble.|$|R
6000|$|Jesus Christ!--It is perilous {{to write}} such a man. You can go crazy on less {{material}} than anybody that ever lived. What in hell has produced all these maniacal imaginings? You {{told me you}} had hired an attendant for ma. Now hire one instantly, and stop this nonsense of wearing Mollie and yourself out <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> nursing yourselves. Hire the attendant, and tell me her cost so that I can instruct Webster & Co. to add it every month to what they already send. Don't fool away any more time about this. And don't write me any more damned rot about [...] "storms," [...] and inability to pay trivial sums of money and--and--hell and damnation! You see I've read only {{the first page of}} your letter; I wouldn't read the rest for a million dollars.|$|E
6000|$|But, more, {{that man}} is at peace with God. He is at peace with God the Father; for he is {{behaving}} as the Father wishes His children to behave. [...] He is at peace with God the Son; for he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which God the Son did when He came not to do His own will, but His Father's; not to grasp at anything for himself, but simply to sacrifice himself for duty, {{for the good of}} man. And he is at peace with God the Holy Spirit; for he is obeying the gracious inspirations of that Spirit, and growing a better man day by day. And so the peace of God keeps that man's heart free from vain desires and angry passions, and his mind from those false and foolish judgments which make the world think things important which are quite unimportant; and, again, fancy things unimportant which are more important to them than the riches of the whole world.|$|E
60|$|Now first I would ask, is any really {{continuous}} and thorough mental process {{going on at}} all about this war? I mean, is there any considerable {{number of people who}} are seeing it as a whole, taking it in as a whole, trying to get a general idea of it from which they can form directing conclusions for the future? Is there any considerable number of people even <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> At any rate let me point out first that there is quite an enormous mass of people who--in spite of the fact that their minds are concentrated on aspects of this war, who are at present hearing, talking, experiencing little else than the war--are nevertheless neither doing nor trying to do anything that deserves to be called thinking about it at all. They may even be suffering quite terribly by it. But they are no more mastering its causes, reasons, conditions, and the possibility of its future prevention than a monkey that has been rescued in a scorching condition from the burning of a house will have mastered the problem of a fire. It is just happening to and about them. It may, for anything they have learnt about it, happen to them again.|$|E
6000|$|The Daughter of the House {{smiled a}} little. [...] "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But he is entirely independent; {{he is under}} nobody; and that suited Almia. A bushwhacker nurse was exactly {{what she wanted to}} be, and as soon as this was settled she made all her {{preparations}} to go to the war." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{diversity}} of the world cannot be overcome in a political system; whoever <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> only produced tyranny and misery. The richness of plurality and diversity will only be increased in the future. All the European and world organizations are not enough, and cannot be effective if not inspired by the universal spirit and consciousness nourished by science and art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> a {{good many}} times, and I've always {{got the best of}} you, even when it wasn't very light, so don't puff {{yourself}} up with the idea that I'm afraid of a big bunch of feathers like you while the sun is shining,' Cheeko said, shaking his tail till Mr. Porcupine says he was afraid it would drop off.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this new}} vision of mine was for him, for the coming generation, the soil in which it must be sown, the Americans of the future. And who so well as Matthew, {{sensitive}} yet brave, would respond to it? I wished not only to give him what I had begun to grasp, to study with him, to be his companion and friend, but to spare him, if possible, some of my own mistakes and sufferings and punishments. But could I go back? Happy coincidences of desires and convictions had been so characteristic of that other self I had been struggling to cast off: I had so easily been persuaded, when I had had a chance of getting Nancy, {{that it was the}} right thing to do! And now, in my loneliness, was I not growing just as eager to be convinced that it was my duty to go back to the family which in the hour of self-sufficiency I had cast off? I had believed in divorce then--why not now? Well, I still believed in it. I had thought of a union with Nancy as something that would bring about the [...] "self-realization that springs from the gratification of a great passion,"--an appealing phrase I had read somewhere. But, it was at least a favourable symptom that I was willing now to confess that the [...] "self-realization" [...] had been a secondary and sentimental consideration, a rosy, self-created halo to give a moral and religious sanction to my desire. Was I not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> very thing now? It tortured me to think so; I strove to achieve a detached consideration of the problem,--to arrive at length at a thought that seemed illuminating: that the it [...] "wrongness" [...] or [...] "rightness," [...] utility and happiness of all such unions depend upon whether or not they become a part of the woof and warp of the social fabric; in other words, whether the gratification of any particular love by divorce and remarriage does or does not tend to destroy a portion of that fabric. Nancy certainly would have been justified in divorce. It did not seem in the retrospect that I would have been: surely not if, after I had married Nancy, I had developed this view of life that seemed to me to be the true view. I should have been powerless to act upon it. But the chances were I should not have developed it, since it would seem that any salvation for me at least must come precisely through suffering, through not getting what I wanted. Was this equivocating? ...|$|E

60|$|Her manner was defiant, {{her tone}} was positive; I doubted both.
