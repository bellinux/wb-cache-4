The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> rulers).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E
25|$|A {{phone call}} {{took place between}} the US President Ronald Reagan and the Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi claimed Italian {{territorial}} rights over the NATO base.

25|$|In 2002, {{five men}} {{who it was}} {{believed}} were connected to Al Qaeda and were planning {{to blow up the}} building, were arrested. Again in 2006, plans by Muslim <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> destroy the Basilica were thwarted by Italian police. The terrorists claimed that a 15th-century fresco inside was insulting to Islam.

25|$|In 2005 the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) {{complained about}} the {{potential}} for <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> use the satellite images in planning attacks, with specific reference to the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor; however, the Australian Federal government did not support the organization's concern.

25|$|Fireforce {{counter-insurgency}} missions {{were designed}} to trap and eliminate <b>terrorists</b> (<b>to</b> use the contemporary term) before they could flee. The Rhodesian Security Force could react quickly to terrorist ambushes, farm attacks, Observation Post sightings, and could also be called in as reinforcements by trackers or patrols which made contact with the enemy. It was first deployed in January 1974 and saw its first action a month later on 24 February 1974. By the end of Rhodesian operations with internal peace agreements, Fireforce was a well-developed counterinsurgency tactic.|$|E
25|$|Further {{example of}} {{criminal}} investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate {{identification of the}} terrorists of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In the attacks, mobile phones {{had been used to}} detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the SIM card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists.|$|E
25|$|Investigations made by DIGOS {{discovered}} that several machines {{used by the}} <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> print their communications from one year before the kidnapping of Moro, which was financed by Moretti, had been previously owned by the Italian state. These included a printer owned by the Raggruppamento Unità Speciali dell'Esercito and, despite its relatively young age and its high value, had been sold out as a scrap. A photocopier was previously owned by the Ministry of Transportation, acquired in 1969 and later sold to Enrico Triaca, a member of BR.|$|E
50|$|The {{term has}} been used by non-U.S. militaries, notably the Rhodesian forces during the Rhodesian Bush War, where it was used interchangeably with terr and <b>terrorist</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} the guerrillas, and by Australian forces during the Vietnam War.|$|R

25|$|Terrorist Recognition Handbook is {{organized}} {{to give the}} reader an analysis of what drives <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> commit violent crimes, and how to detect them beforehand. The book provides an itemized grouping of tells that could indicate a terrorist {{in the act of}} planning a crime, and the strategy for how to group the collected intelligence on such individuals for intelligence reporting. Nance goes over ways to reduce the negative impact from potential incidents of terrorism. The author illustrates his points with charts and describes {{weapons of mass destruction and}} the more easily obtainable weapons of terror used by suspects.|$|E
25|$|After {{being told}} by his LeT {{handlers}} that the plot would be put on hold, Headley became disenchanted with the group. Syed became Headley's new handler and introduced him to Ilyas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani military commando and leader of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, an Islamist organization active in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Kashmiri took over sponsorship of the Denmark plot and made changes to the plan, using the Mumbai attacks as inspiration; he wanted <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> storm the Jyllands-Posten offices, have its staff be taken hostage and executed, and then have their severed heads {{thrown out of the}} windows of the newsroom in an international media spectacle.|$|E
25|$|LaRose {{was taken}} into custody in October 2009, and her arrest was made public on March 9, 2010, after seven alleged co-conspirators were arrested in Ireland (five of whom were later {{released}} by the Irish authorities). Among those arrested in Ireland (later released by the Irish authorities, but then arrested by U.S. authorities and charged as a co-defendant with LaRose in a superseding indictment) was Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, an American woman from Colorado, whose parents say she was recruited by LaRose. Specifically, LaRose was charged with trying to recruit Islamic <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> wage violent Jihad and of plotting to murder the Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had drawn a cartoon of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} false positives (identifying an {{innocent}} traveller as a <b>terrorist)</b> <b>to</b> true positives (detecting a would-be terrorist) is, therefore, very high; and because almost every alarm {{is a false}} positive, the positive predictive value of these screening tests is very low.|$|R
50|$|EgyptAir Flight 321 was a Cairo-Luxor Egyptian flight {{which was}} hijacked by three armed <b>terrorists</b> {{claiming}} <b>to</b> {{be from the}} Abd Al-Nasir Movement.

25|$|The ISI {{was created}} after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, {{due to the}} Military Intelligence of Pakistan's (MI) weak performance. When Zia-ul-Haq seized power in July 1977, he started his K2 (Kashmir and Khalistan) strategy, {{initiating}} Operation Tupac. He gave ISI the duty to make Jammu and Kashmir a part of Pakistan, and to send <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> Punjab. According to arrested ISI agents, the intelligence agency's aims are to confound Indian Muslims using Kashmiri Muslims, extend the ISI network in India, cultivate terrorists and terrorist groups, cause attacks similar to the 1993 Bombay bombings in other cities, and create a state of insurgency in Muslim-dominated regions. The ISI has allegedly set up bases in Nepal and Bangladesh, which are used for operations in North-East India.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able to slip out of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult for <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> travel {{back and forth to the}} Western world.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the US Air Force who were there to patrol the southern Iraqi no-fly zone enacted after the Gulf War. In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Louis Freeh said in his book My FBI that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, {{and it was not}} until his last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack. This was just before some of the counts would have expired due to a five-year statute of limitations. In the book, Freeh maintains that he was obstructed by the Clinton Administration for political reasons in investigating the bombing and bringing the <b>terrorists</b> <b>to</b> justice.|$|E
50|$|In December 2005 the KNB extradited Rustam Chagilov, a {{suspected}} <b>terrorist,</b> <b>to</b> Russia.
