25|$|Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' {{describe}} desirable {{aspects of}} character. Because {{it was once}} {{believed to be a}} moral evaluation, conscientiousness was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality of individual differences in conscientiousness has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> about their degrees of conscientiousness. Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of conscientiousness predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and {{it soon became clear that}} all five factors are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which conscientiousness is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.|$|E

He took {{infinite}} pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He—or she—does {{not know how}} to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos... and it is precisely in this respect <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> such terrible errors in playing his works." ...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{stream of}} {{research}} is investigating how choices <b>people</b> <b>make</b> for themselves are different from choices <b>people</b> <b>make</b> for others. In this paper, I propose that these choices vary according to regulatory focus, such <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> choices for themselves are prevention focused, whereas <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> choices for others are promotion focused. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> choices for others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In 6 studies, including a field study, I found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> choices for themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options, yet, <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> choices for others are more satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options.

2500|$|Evaluation-focused: An evaluative trait is {{one that}} {{involves}} a fundamental value judgment about oneself, rather than a simple description ("I am confident and worthy," [...] vs. [...] "I am ambitious").

40|$|In both {{organizational}} and social arenas, <b>people</b> <b>make</b> decisions {{for themselves and}} for other people. But research in decision making has provided little input into how these decisions are psychologically different. In this paper, I propose that decisions- depending on whether people are deciding for themselves or others-vary according to regulatory focus, such <b>that,</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> decisions for themselves are in a prevention focus, whereas <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> decisions for others are in a promotion focus. Drawing on regulatory focus, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> decisions for others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In seven studies, including a field study and a mini meta-analysis, I found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> decisions for themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options, yet, <b>people</b> who <b>make</b> decisions for others are more satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options.

2500|$|The Leopold and Loeb case raised, in a well-publicized trial, Darrow's lifelong {{contention}} that psychological, physical, and environmental influences—not a conscious choice {{between right and}} wrong—control human behavior. Darrow's psychiatric expert witnesses testified that both boys [...] "were decidedly deficient in emotion". Darrow later argued that emotion {{is necessary for the}} decisions <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make.</b> When someone tries to go against a certain law or custom that is forbidden, he wrote, he should feel a sense of revulsion. As neither Leopold nor Loeb had a working emotional system, they did not feel revolted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, the American {{sociologist}} Read Bain {{wrote that}} [...] "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices {{and the skills}} by which we produce and use them." [...] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. [...] Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> and use. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of [...] "technique" [...] to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' {{theory of}} {{structuration}} explores {{the question of}} whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet Wallace Stevens who suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression [...] "duality of structure". At a basic level, this means <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what.

60|$|I {{have often}} heard persons of good {{judgment}} {{say that all}} the stir <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing {{to the strength of}} imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds; {{that there is no such}} thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking; that people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realises it to them that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them, talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.|$|E

60|$|I crossed one {{swell of}} living turf after another, {{looking for a}} place to sit down and draw. Do not, for heaven's sake, imagine I was going to sketch from Nature. I was going to draw devils and seraphim, and blind old gods that men worshipped before the dawn of right, and saints in robes of angry crimson, and seas of strange green, and all the sacred or monstrous symbols that look so well in bright colours on brown paper. They are much better worth drawing than Nature; also they are much easier to draw. When a cow came slouching by in the field next to me, a mere artist might have drawn it; but I always get wrong in the hind legs of quadrupeds. So I drew the soul of the cow; which I saw there plainly walking before me in the sunlight; and the soul was all purple and silver, and had seven horns and the mystery that belongs to all the beasts. But though I could not with a crayon get the best out of the {{landscape}}, it does not follow that the landscape was not getting the best out of me. And this, I think, is the mistake <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> about the old poets who lived before Wordsworth, and were supposed not to care very much about Nature because they did not describe it much.|$|E
60|$|Down {{goes the}} axe; the poor wretch's head rolls gasping into the basket; the spectators go home, pondering; and Mr. Executioner {{and his aides}} have, in half an hour, removed all traces of the august sacrifice, and of the altar on which it had been performed. Say, Mr. Briefless, {{do you think that}} any single person, meditating murder, would be deterred {{therefrom}} by beholding this--nay, a thousand more executions? It is not for moral improvement, as I take it, nor for opportunity to make appropriate remarks upon the punishment of crime, <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> a holiday of a killing-day, and leave their homes and occupations, to flock and witness the cutting off of a head. Do we crowd to see Mr. Macready in the new tragedy, or Mademoiselle Ellssler in her last new ballet and flesh-colored stockinnet pantaloons, out of a pure love of abstract poetry and beauty; or from a strong notion that we shall be excited, in different ways, by the actor and the dancer? And so, as we go to have a meal of fictitious terror at the tragedy, of something more questionable in the ballet, we go for a glut of blood to the execution. The lust is in every man's nature, more or less. Did you ever witness a wrestling or boxing match? The first clatter of the kick on the shins, or the first drawing of blood, makes the stranger shudder a little; but soon the blood is his chief enjoyment, and he thirsts for it with a fierce delight. It is a fine grim pleasure that we have in seeing a man killed; and I make no doubt that the organs of destructiveness must begin to throb and swell as we witness the delightful savage spectacle.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first great}} mistake <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>make</b> in the matter, is the {{supposition}} {{that they must}} see a thing if it be before their eyes. They forget the great truth told them by Locke, Book ii. chap. 9, § 3:--"This is certain, that whatever alterations {{are made in the}} body, if they reach not the mind, whatever impressions are made on the outward parts, if they are not taken notice of within, there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies, with no other effect than it does a billet, unless the motion be continued to the brain, and there the sense of heat or idea of pain be produced in the mind, wherein consists actual perception. How often may a man observe in himself, that while his mind is intently employed in the contemplation of some subjects and curiously surveying some ideas that are there, it takes no notice of impressions of sounding bodies, made upon the organ of hearing, with the same attention that uses to be for the producing the ideas of sound! A sufficient impulse there may be on the organ, but it not reaching the observation of the mind, there follows no perception, and though the motion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear, yet no sound is heard." [...] And what is here said, which all must feel by their own experience to be true, is more remarkably and necessarily the case with sight than with any other of the senses, for this reason, that the ear is not accustomed to exercise constantly its functions of hearing; it is accustomed to stillness, and the occurrence of a sound of any kind whatsoever is apt to awake attention, and be followed with perception, in proportion to the degree of sound; but the eye, during our waking hours, exercises constantly its function of seeing; it is its constant habit; we always, as far as the bodily organ is concerned, see something, and we always see in the same degree, so that the occurrence of sight, as such, to the eye, is only the continuance of its necessary state of action, and awakes no attention whatsoever, except by the particular nature and quality of the sight. And thus, unless the minds of men are particularly directed to the impressions of sight, objects pass perpetually before the eyes without conveying any impression to the brain at all; and so pass actually unseen, not merely unnoticed, but in the full, clear sense of the word, unseen. And numbers of men being pre-occupied with business or care of some description, totally unconnected with the impressions of sight, such is actually the case with them, they receiving from nature only the inevitable sensations of blueness, redness, darkness, light, etc., and except at particular and rare moments, no more whatsoever.|$|E
