Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> murder of a young producer whom he knew.

As more body parts were dug up, near the premises, hundreds of local residents descended on the spot and alleged that there was an organ trade connection to <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> killings of young children.

25|$|The Da Vinci Code is a 2006 American mystery thriller film {{directed}} by Ron Howard, written by Akiva Goldsman, {{and based on}} Dan Brown's 2003 best-selling novel of the same name. The first in the Robert Langdon film series, the film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jürgen Prochnow, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany. In the film, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconography and symbology from Harvard University, is the prime suspect in <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Saunière. In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation. A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo da Vinci's wall painting, The Last Supper. Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within Opus Dei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wishes to keep the true Grail a secret; the revelation of this secret would certainly destroy Christianity.|$|E
25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke {{the wall of}} silence that was surrounding the My Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E

500|$|Janet Maslin for The New York Times {{said that}} <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> {{violence}} in Bound would likely limit its audience and Ebert said that its shocking violence would offend some audiences. Some critics {{said that the}} violent behavior of the characters had no moral justification. Rita Kempley for The Washington Post called it [...] "well-nigh unwatchable cruelty for its own sake". McCarthy, who called the central {{relationship between the two}} women unbelievable and unsympathetic, said [...] "just because Violet and Corky fall for each other doesn't mean they somehow fall into a privileged state of grace in which vile behavior can be forgiven." [...] Other critics were less concerned, calling the violence [...] "comically excessive" [...] and [...] "Tarantino-like".|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is {{also about}} the fear of death. The section cut from the story {{highlights}} Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the cut section, later published as [...] "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is [...] "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> reality of death, which can have done [...] "little to assuage Nick's fears." [...] Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally vague {{about the details of}} the birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely [...] "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".|$|E
500|$|The {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Siouxsie and the Banshees picked {{the title of}} Billboard Top 100 hit single [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] (included in their 1991's album Superstition) from Mansfield's 1957 film Kiss Them for Me. Lyrics of the song uses Mansfield's catchword [...] "divoon", and refers to her heart-shaped swimming pool, her love of champagne and parties, and to <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> automobile accident which claimed her life in 1967. In Grok, a novel by Tom Maremaa, a character plays the CD and asks, [...] "Yes, kiss them for me [...] I may be delayed." [...] Too Hot To Handle, the UFO song considered {{to one of the}} top 500 heavy metal songs, takes its title from a Jayne Mansfield film. Mansfield is also alluded in the song [...] "The Actor" [...] by Robbie Williams, from the album [...] "Rudebox". Alternative rock band The Chills released [...] "16 Heartthrobs" [...] as a memorial to Mansfield. In 1997, Courtney Love of the alternative rock band Hole used a photo of Mansfield's wrecked car in the album artwork for the group's compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade.|$|E

[...] Janet Maslin, film and {{literary}} critic for The New York Times, gave the film a resoundingly negative review, saying that [...] "though this {{is by no means}} <b>the</b> <b>grisliest</b> or most witless film made from one of Mr. King's horrific fantasies, it can lay claim to being the most unpleasant." ...|$|R

Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it [...] "might be {{the exception to}} the usual run of low-budget horror films". The Los Angeles Times called the film an [...] "instant classic", proclaiming it as [...] "probably <b>the</b> <b>grisliest</b> well-made movie ever."

500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E
500|$|Waugh left Hertford in {{the summer}} of 1924 without {{completing}} his degree, and a received a brief note from Cruttwell [...] expressing disappointment with this performance. Although the pair never met again, a few years later Cruttwell spoke disparagingly of Waugh, to the latter's prospective mother-in-law, Lady Burghclere, describing him as vice-ridden and [...] "living off vodka and absinthe". Once Waugh had established himself as a writer, he resumed the vendetta against his former tutor by introducing a succession of disreputable or absurd characters called [...] "Cruttwell" [...] into his novels and stories. In Decline and Fall (1928) [...] "Toby Cruttwell" [...] is a psychopathic burglar; in Vile Bodies (1930) the name belongs to a snobbish Conservative MP. In Black Mischief (1932) [...] "Cruttwell" [...] is a social parasite, and he becomes a dubious osteopath or [...] "bone-setter" [...] in A Handful of Dust (1934). [...] In Scoop (1938), [...] "General Cruttwell" [...] is a salesman with a fake tropical tan at the Army & Navy Stores. The 1935 short story [...] "Mr Loveday's Little Outing", which recounts <b>the</b> <b>grisly</b> deeds of an escaped homicidal maniac, was originally published as [...] "Mr Cruttwell's Little Outing". The final Cruttwell reference in Waugh's fiction came in 1939, in the short story [...] "An Englishman's Home", {{in the form of an}} embezzling Wolf Cub master. In 1935, in an additional gesture of sarcastic ridicule, Waugh told a survey in which modern novelists were asked to nominate their best work [...] that he had yet to write his masterpiece: [...] "It is the memorial biography of C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, some time Dean of Hertford College, Oxford, and my old history tutor. It is a labour of love to one to whom, under God, I owe everything". As with Waugh's student taunting, Cruttwell made no public response, although according to Stannard he anticipated each new Waugh novel with much trepidation about how he might be portrayed.|$|E

50|$|In 1992 {{his oldest}} son was murdered, the random {{victim of a}} rampage {{shooting}} at Simon's Rock.

The book, Gone Boy: A Walkabout, met with critical success, and was Entertainment Weekly’s “best book of the year” for 1999. The satisfaction Gibson derived from writing it convinced him that he should write another one. Demon of the Waters: The True Story of the Mutiny of the Whaleship Globe was the result.
