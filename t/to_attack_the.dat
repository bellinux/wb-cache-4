5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton {{on the morning}} of December 26, 1776, Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania. He subsequently decided <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton. On the night of January 2, 1777, Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek. That night, he evacuated his position, circled around General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> British garrison at Princeton.|$|E

5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided {{that they had no}} choice but <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>The</b> reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>The</b> same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E
5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark {{that led to his}} desire <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the Iran hostage crisis in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; he was ordered <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After {{the end of the}} war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E

5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarians with Magyar support.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many {{newspapers}} {{sought to}} portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.|$|E
50|$|The Egyptians {{launched}} their offensive {{in the early}} morning of October 14, at 6:30. The mechanized infantry brigade was <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> in <b>the</b> direction of the Gidi Pass, one armored brigade was <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> in <b>the</b> direction of the Mitla Pass, one brigade was <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> towards Baluza, and two brigades were <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> in <b>the</b> direction of Tasa. As anticipated by many Egyptian officers, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was a failure. Encountering stiff Israeli resistance, the Egyptian assault came to a halt after suffering heavy losses, and Egyptian troops retreated back to their lines on the Suez Canal.|$|R

5|$|Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr. (1904–1955), a United States Naval Academy graduate, Class of 1927, {{commanded}} the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division during the Bougainville amphibious operations. On November 1, 1943. The Allies intended {{to establish a}} beachhead around Cape Torokina, within which an airfield would be built. Allied forces did not plan, at that time, to try to capture the entire island of Bougainville from Japanese forces. An attempt by the Japanese Navy <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> U.S. landing forces was defeated in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, between November 1 and November 2. A subsequent attempt by Japanese land forces <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Allied beachhead was defeated in the Battle of Koromokina Lagoon.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim decided <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Maniots {{from the}} rear. His {{plan was to}} send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E

5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling {{only for a}} cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Union lines in his front.|$|E
5|$|From the Japanese perspective, {{the battle}} was not going too well either. The Japanese had {{expected}} a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American objective, and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force. By 2March, Ezaki had resolved <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3March.|$|E

His grip on the south was enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.|$|E
