5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the first part takes place in flashbacks while a team of ill-equipped soldiers and scientists arrive at the Destiny. Eli Wallace (David Blue) solves a mathematical equation in an online computer game, planted there by Stargate Command. For his achievement, Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) recruit Wallace to the Icarus program, which is attempting <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> a nine-chevron address with the Stargate. Wallace's solution {{is the key to}} controlling the power levels for the Gate. He is taken aboard the Hammond, an Earth Daedalus-class starship, to be taken to the planet where Icarus is set up. During the journey, he meets Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque), daughter of Senator Alan Armstrong (Christopher McDonald).|$|E
25|$|Stargate Universe {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} a nine-symbol address, the purpose of the ninth chevron never having been explored in the previous series. The nine-symbol addresses act as codes <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> specific Stargates, with the only two known nine-symbol addresses used <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> from the Milky Way galaxy to Destiny, a massive Ancient vessel that was part of a project to explore the universe, with the project being abandoned when they started researching into ascension among other things, and from Destiny to Earth. Like eight-symbol addresses, the dialing of this address requires a significant amount of power, such that the scientists on Icarus Base had to tap into the planet's naqahdriah core.|$|E

25|$|After the {{conversion}} <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> service in 1949, San Jose telephone numbers started with names including ALpine-, ANdrews-, BAldwin-, CLayburn-, and CYpress-. As the North American Dialing Plan {{evolved in the}} 1950s, these became today's 25x-, 26x-, 22x-, 258-, and 29x-numbers, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Pegasus Stargates contain 36 symbols {{as opposed}} to the Milky Way's 39. Seven symbols are still {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> an interplanetary address, adhering to the same constraints as a Milky Way gate. With 35 symbols, the Stargate network in the Pegasus galaxy has 1,168,675,200 (35×34×33×32×31×30) possible 7-symbol addresses.|$|E
25|$|Although HyperCard stacks did {{not operate}} over the Internet, by 1988, at least 300 stacks were {{publicly}} available for download from the commercial CompuServe network (which was {{not connected to}} the official Internet yet) and the system could link phone numbers on a user's computer together and enable them <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> numbers without a modem.|$|E

50|$|This, {{according}} to Pizza Hut’s spokesperson, Chris Romoser, represented an advantage for everyone involved: users had to press fewer buttons on their remote control {{than they would}} have <b>to</b> <b>dialing</b> for delivery, and less restaurant-employee time will be required for the completion of the ordering process.|$|R
25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> the operator or {{look up the}} telephone number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to search through the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed subscribers <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> their own long-distance calls.|$|E
25|$|In France, many {{telephone}} exchanges were closed at night {{but it was}} still possible to make emergency calls. An operator had to connect the emergency calls only. In 1913, an automatic system was set up. It made provision for calling the police by dialling 17 and the fire brigade by dialling 18. As more manual {{telephone exchanges}} were converted <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> operation, more and more subscribers had access to these special numbers. The service was not widespread until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of {{radioactivity}} became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge {{from the}} early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the {{freeware}} NetFoss Telnet FOSSIL driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real POTS phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with DOSEMU (DOS emulator).|$|E

25|$|Direct {{distance}} dialing, {{which allowed}} callers to reach other users outside their local calling area without operator assistance, {{was introduced to}} the public in Englewood. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California. As of that date, customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial some exchanges in the New York City area, were able <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> 11 cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code preceding the local number.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{phishing}} attacks {{require a}} fake website. Messages that {{claimed to be}} from a bank told users <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts. Once the phone number (owned by the phisher, and provided by a voice over IP service) was dialed, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. Vishing (voice phishing) sometimes uses fake caller-ID data to give the appearance that calls come from a trusted organisation. SMS phishing uses cell phone text messages to induce people to divulge their personal information.|$|E
25|$|There were {{optional}} systems <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> {{the phone}} or pick it up, but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, {{the call}} setup success rate (CSSR) is the {{fraction}} of the attempts {{to make a call}} that result in a connection <b>to</b> the <b>dialled</b> number (due <b>to</b> various reasons not all call attempts end with a connection <b>to</b> the <b>dialled</b> number). This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all call attempts made.|$|R

25|$|Hayes and the company's {{marketing}} manager Glenn Sirkis approached Heatherington with an outline {{for a new}} command-driven external modem. A few external modems already offered the ability <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started, but the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up, while the modem was already connected. There needed to be some way {{to indicate that the}} characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end, but commands to be acted on.|$|E
25|$|Los Gatos {{is served}} by three central offices. Historically, these were called the Six Office, the Four Office, and the Mountain Office. The first two of these designations come from the {{historic}} exchange names when the town converted from manual <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> service. Phone numbers in these two offices were ELgato-6 and ELgato-4 numbers, respectively (dialed as ELx-xxxx.) As the area migrated to seven-digit numbers, these changed to 356- and 354-numbers. In their earlier life, all numbers for the segment of town served by each office had the respective prefix or office code related to that office.|$|E
25|$|Most of the United Kingdom had no {{lettered}} telephone dials {{until the}} introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) in 1958. Until then, only the director areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) and the adjacent non-director areas had the lettered dials; the director exchanges used the three-letter, four-number format. With {{the introduction of}} trunk dialing, the need for all callers to be able <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> numbers with letters in them led to the much more widespread use of lettered dials. The need for dials with letters ceased with the conversion to all-digit numbering in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Fictitious {{phone numbers}} {{starting}} with 55 used the fictitious exchange name KLondike (55). The letter Q was never {{used in the}} naming system, but Z was often mapped on the telephone <b>dial</b> <b>to</b> the digit 0 (zero) <b>to</b> facilitate <b>dialing</b> of Zenith numbers.|$|R
