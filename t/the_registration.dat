A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E

5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> of most American-bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book.

Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred.|$|E
