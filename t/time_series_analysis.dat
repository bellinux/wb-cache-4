SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, {{as well as the}} SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>analysis.</b> A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The Food and Drug Administration standardized on SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002. Vertical products like SAS Financial Management and SAS Human Capital Management (then called CFO Vision and HR Vision respectively) were also introduced. JMP was developed by SAS co-founder John Sall and a team of developers {{to take advantage of the}} graphical user interface introduced in the 1984 Apple Macintosh and shipped for the first time in 1989. Updated versions of JMP were released continuously after 2002 with the most recent release being from 2016.|$|E

Instead of adopting the traditional <b>time</b> <b>series</b> intervention <b>analysis</b> with only one or a few interventions, this study explores the possibility of integrating <b>time</b> <b>series</b> intervention <b>analysis</b> and a knowledge-based system to analyze multiple-interventions data.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a group of young quantitative practitioners who became known as “rocket scientists” arrived on Wall Street and brought along personal computers. This led to an explosion of both the amount and variety of computational finance applications. Many of the new techniques came from signal processing and speech recognition rather than traditional fields of computational economics like optimization and <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

His 1955 paper time-domain compensation for closed-loop systems by a delay line method presented a new approach to the synthesis and analysis of closed-loop systems in the time domain. Ho collaborated with Rudolf E. Kalman, a pioneer of modern control theory. Before Kalman, <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>analysis</b> and classical control theory studied the frequency domain, using harmonic analysis, especially Laplace and Fourier transforms. Kalman developed the study of the time domain using state-space models. Joining Kalman, Ho showed that the state-space representation [...] provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze dynamical systems with multiple inputs and outputs which would otherwise take multiple Laplace transforms to encode; further, the state-space representation can be extended into nonlinear systems. Their paper [...] controllability of linear dynamic systems, developed the theory of controllability (then known as the [...] "Kalman-Bertram condition").|$|E
