5|$|After Margaret's death, {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown. By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming overgrown and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were {{using it as a}} farmhouse.|$|E

The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were {{not expected to}} be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries.

30|$|New {{versions}} of Korovkin type approximation theorems using {{the notion of}} f-lacunary statistical convergence have been established.

Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, the castle was held by William le Gros, the bishop of Winchester and {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back the castle and took steps to improve <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> Southampton castle, as part of his attempt to improve the general standard of security in the south. At this time, Southampton was considered a key fortification, classed alongside other important castles such as the Tower of London, Windsor, Oxford, Lincoln and Winchester.|$|E

5|$|Edward, the Black Prince became Duke of Cornwall in 1337 and he {{acquired}} Lydford Castle on Margaret's death in 1342. Extensive repairs {{took place over}} the next three years, and the castle was considered to be well roofed and decorated inside. Over the next two centuries <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the castle fluctuated. Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead, to be used on castles in Cornwall.

5|$|From 1691 until around 1860 {{there had}} been no choir at the cathedral. There was also no organ for some time.

In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, Some Account of <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral's choir and to purchase a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E
