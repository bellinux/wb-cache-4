40|$|<b>The</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object greatly changes under {{different}} lighting conditions. Even so, {{previous studies have}} demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object under varying illumination conditions can be represented by a linear subspace. <b>A</b> set <b>of</b> basis images spanning such a linear subspace can be obtained by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) for <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> images taken {{under different}} lighting conditions. Since little is known about how to sample <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object in order to correctly obtain its basis images, it was a common practice to use as many input images as possible. In this study, we present a novel method for analytically obtaining <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> basis images <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object for varying illumination from input images of the object taken properly under <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> light sources, such as point light sources or extended light sources. Our proposed method incorporates the sampling theorem of spherical harmonics for determining <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> lighting directions to efficiently sample <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object. We further consider the issue of aliasing caused by insufficient sampling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object’s <b>appearance.</b> In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of using extended light sources for modeling <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object under varying illumination without suffering the aliasing caused by insufficient sampling <b>of</b> its <b>appearance...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs.

5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate structure {{attached to the}} bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. <b>The</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. <b>The</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
