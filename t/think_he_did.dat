25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien {{had a great deal}} of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O'Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E
500|$|Former {{teammate}} Moose Skowron {{commented on}} Wilhelm's key pitch, saying, [...] "Hoyt {{was a good}} guy, and he threw the best knuckleball I ever saw. You never knew what Hoyt's pitch would do. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> either." [...] Baseball executive Roland Hemond agreed, saying, [...] "Wilhelm's knuckleball did more than anyone else's... There was so much action on it." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{day when}} we were living at Kawaihae my {{grandmother}} went to Hulihee to see Kuakini, who was not well. I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased me as he always did. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{features}} the final appearance of Harry Hamlin as Season 1 antagonist Aaron Echolls after {{the character is}} murdered by Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Later, we learn that the murder was ordered by Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), who appears briefly in a small cameo. Dunn had made his final regular appearance in [...] "Donut Run" [...] and had left the show partly due to fan dislike of the character. Dunn later stated {{that he thought that}} the purpose of the cameo was to garner sympathy for the character before his final departure. [...] "I think Rob's goal was to leave the character on a high note. I certainly <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in a heroic way." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} [...] Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, {{one of the}} most popular and respected jazz singers of New Orleans, said: [...] "Jolson? I loved him. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> wonders for the blacks and glorified entertainment." ...|$|E
2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, but there was another murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, {{as if he had been}} there before.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is his way," [...] said Noel; [...] "always when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> {{has reason}} to <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>think,</b> {{but this is an}} error. He didn't see the army. I noticed him, and he didn't see it. He was troubled by his old complaint." ...|$|R

2500|$|... {{more of a}} pop {{producer}} kind of guy. He's {{worked with}} Candlebox before and sold millions of albums with them, so working with us, {{we were kind of}} like his lab rats, you know? He's never really done a metal band before but overall I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a pretty fantastic job. He got a real live quality out of us because we were always used to doing drums first and then the bass, and then the guitar and then the vocals at the very end. This time we recorded most of the songs live with the whole band and then after one song was done, Warrel would immediately sing on it [...] of saving all of [...] to the very end, which kind of saves his voice in the overall recording process. I guess the whole album was done in a very different atmosphere and aspect that sounds really good.|$|E
2500|$|When {{speaking}} on the album's features in March 2013, Schoolboy Q told MTV, [...] "I just kept it real in house with my homies. This my first album; it's real special to me. I don't wanna be messing with this dude, with this dude, this dude. It's all in house, it's the same Q. Like the fans, I'mma give 'em what they want." [...] In March 2013, Schoolboy Q once again stated the album was four songs away from being completed. That month, Schoolboy Q revealed to Vibe {{that he decided to}} continue his [...] "Druggy's wit Hoes" [...] song series, for the album. He revealed it's one of the easier songs for him to do, as it comes natural: [...] "I go to the studio, get faded, said, 'Cuh Soul, I got Druggy Wit Hoes Part 3,' and he said, 'I'm on my way.' I think he was off acid that night too. Yeah, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> his verse off acid [...]" [...] In April 2013, he stated {{he had been in the}} studio with American record producers David Banner and Pharrell Williams.|$|E
2500|$|On July 9, 2012, Ton Do-Nguyen, {{uploaded}} a shot-for-shot recreation of {{the clip}} on YouTube, wearing a snuggie. Throughout the video, the color-blocked {{style and the}} very fast cuts of the original are mimicked. The video went viral and gathered attention by media; Knowles herself responded to it on her website, calling it [...] "brilliant", adding, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this video better than I did". Will Goodman of CBS News described it as an [...] "amazing tribute" [...] and the [...] "cutest and most impressive tribute to Beyonce that has ever {{been done in the}} history of forever". Mawuse Ziegbe from The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "highly produced tribute". Aisha Harris from Slate magazine described the editing of the video as [...] "far superior to that of the average YouTube user", adding that Do-Nguyen transformed makeshift performance spaces like his basement into venues for [...] "visual splendor". She concluded the review by writing that his attention to detail is [...] "fascinating". Following the popularity of the remake, MTV asked Do-Nguyen to create a video mash-up of the Best Choreography nominees at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and gave him free tickets to the award show.|$|E

2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
