5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is <b>the</b> <b>delta</b> wing. <b>The</b> <b>delta</b> wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. <b>The</b> <b>delta</b> wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates ten river deltas for {{anthropogenic}} {{environmental change}} in the Inner Sogn Region, Western Norway, using aerial photographs of the 1960 s and the 2010 s. In addition, it presents qualitative interviews made with two experts, focusing {{on the development of}} bird and fish populations in <b>the</b> observed river <b>deltas.</b> These river <b>deltas</b> are <b>the</b> Årøy <b>Delta</b> near Sogndal, <b>the</b> Lærdal <b>Delta</b> at Lærdal, <b>the</b> Sogndalsfjøra <b>Delta</b> at Sogndal, <b>the</b> Gaupne <b>Delta</b> at Gaupne, <b>the</b> Gudvangen <b>Delta</b> at Gudvangen, <b>the</b> Skjolden <b>Delta</b> at Skjolden <b>the</b> Årdalstangen <b>Delta</b> at Årdalstangen, <b>the</b> Bøyaøyra <b>Delta</b> near Fjærland, <b>the</b> Vetlefjordøyra <b>Delta</b> at Vetlefjorden and <b>the</b> Flåm <b>Delta</b> at Flåm. <b>The</b> observed river <b>deltas</b> are habitats for fish and bird populations. <b>The</b> <b>deltas</b> are used as resting places, feeding grounds, nesting areas and for nursery. All <b>the</b> observed river <b>deltas</b> are influenced by human activity. Two of these river deltas have changed from > 50 % natural to 50 % natural to > 25 % cultivated. Four out of the ten observed river deltas have changed from > 50 % natural to >> 50 % urban. Three river deltas changed from > 50 % urban to >> 50 % urban. <b>The</b> natural <b>delta</b> area of six out of ten river deltas decreased by more than 50 % between the 1960 s and the 2010 s due to land fillings, road buildings and harbor constructions. These results suggest that the progressing destruction of <b>the</b> natural river <b>delta</b> environment had a declining effect on the fish and bird population of the region. To reduce the potential for future conflicts, it is suggested that river <b>delta</b> management uses <b>the</b> historic development of <b>the</b> river <b>deltas</b> as an additional tool when deciding on future delta change...|$|R
