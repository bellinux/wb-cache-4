5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>At</b> this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E
5|$|Needham {{may have}} {{introduced}} Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute {{of the day}} and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke.|$|E

As children got older, parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E

25|$|At 9pm on 10 May, Chamberlain {{announced}} {{the change of}} Prime Minister over the BBC. Churchill's first act as Prime Minister was to ask Attlee {{to come to the}} Admiralty to see him.

According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> ten.

25|$|After {{the last}} take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu {{performance}} on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall which led to her bedroom, she collapsed with a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30a.m. lying in the hallway. The Jimmy Durante Show episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955, and a clip of the episode {{was included in the}} A Network's Biography episode about the singer.|$|E
25|$|The Nunivak Eskimos (Nuniwarmiut in Cup'ig, Nunivaarmiut in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) ate {{frequently}} {{in the course of}} a 24-hour period. They went <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> sundown or early evening in the spring and fall, and well before sundown in summer, but arose early, often at 3:00 or 4:00a.m. and regularly at 5:00 or 5:30. The time of rising depended on the sea tide and the time when tomcod or other fish would be running. The first meal of the day was eaten at this time and another about 11:00a.m., with snacks once or twice in between depending on the work schedule and the availability of food. The evening meal was usually at 4:30 or 5:00p.m. with additional snacks between the main meals. In winter the entire meal schedule was likely to be moved forward, with the first meal of the day being eaten at 10:00 or 10:30a.m. The most common food was dried or frozen fish dipped in seal oil. The evening or late afternoon meal, the hot meal of the day, frequently consisted of boiled fish or other boiled food and tea.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Cheatham's {{division}} under Maj. Gen. John C. Brown {{was moved}} into position for another attack on Spring Hill, on Cleburne's right. Brown did not attack, however. It {{was reported that}} there were Union troops in position on his right flank and front and that Forrest's cavalrymen, promised to protect his right flank, {{did not seem to}} be present. Brown decided to consult with his corps commander before proceeding, sending two staff officers to find Cheatham and halting his troops while he awaited a decision. By the time Cheatham and Brown were able to speak, the battlefield was in total darkness, and the two officers decided that an assault conducted then without knowing the condition of their right flank might be a disaster. Hood was furious that the attack had not proceeded as he intended and that the pike was still open. He dispatched a staff officer to find Stewart to assist Cheatham. Having been up since 3 a.m., Hood went <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> 9 p.m., confident that whatever setbacks his army had suffered during the day, they would be able to correct them in the morning and bag Schofield.|$|E
