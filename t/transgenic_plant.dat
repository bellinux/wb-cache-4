40|$|Summary The mtl D gene {{encoding}} mannitol- 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of mannitol from fructose, was cloned from Escherichia coli and trans-ferred to poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) through Agrobac-terium-mediated transformation. The <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> {{were screened}} and selected on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 30 – 50 mg l – 1 kanamycin and verified by polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting. Expression {{of the gene}} led to synthesis and accumulation of mannitol in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and capillary gas chromatography (GC) showed that <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> accumulated much more mannitol in their tis-sues than the wild-type plants, whether cultured in vitro, or grown hydroponically or in the field. Increased salt tolerance of <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> was observed both in vitro and in hydroponic culture. The transgenic buds rooted normally on MS medium containing 50 mM NaCl, whereas wild-type buds did not. In the 40 -day hydroponic ex-periments, <b>transgenic</b> poplar <b>plants</b> survived in a 75 -mM NaCl treatment, whereas the wild-type poplar plants tolerated only 25 mM NaCl. Under the same NaCl stress, stomatal conduc-tance, transpiration rates and photosynthetic rates were all higher in <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> than in wild-type plants, whereas cellular relative conductivity was lower. We demonstrated that the mtlD gene was expressed in <b>transgenic</b> poplar <b>plants,</b> re-sulting {{either directly or indirectly}} in mannitol accumulation and improved salt tolerance. The constant mannitol concentra-tions in <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> during the NaCl treatments indicated that mannitol accumulation caused by the mtlD gene was not a consequence of NaCl stress. Height growth was reduced by about 50 % in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> compared with the wild-type plants in the absence of salt; however, relative growth rate was much less influenced by salt stress in <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> than in wild-type plants. The stunted growth of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> may in part explain their improved salt tolerance...|$|R

Moreover, direct measurements on isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from the AVP 1 <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> and from wild type demonstrate that the vesicles from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> have enhanced cation uptake. The phenotypes of the AVP 1 <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> suggest that increasing the vacuolar proton gradient results in increased solute accumulation and water retention.

These <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> grow well {{in the presence of}} 200 mM NaCl and also under a water-deprivation regime, while wild-type plants exhibit chlorosis and growth inhibition. Leaf area decreased much more in wild-type than in <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> subjected to salt or drought stress. The leaf water potential was less negative for wild-type than for <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> This could be due to an enhanced osmotic adjustment in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Moreover, these <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> accumulate more Na + and K + in their leaf tissue than the wild-type plants. The toxic effect of Na + accumulation in the cytosol is reduced by its sequestration into the vacuole. The rate of water loss under drought or salt stress was higher in wild-type than <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Increased vacuolar solute accumulation and water retention could confer the phenotype of salt and drought tolerance of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Overexpression of the isolated genes from wheat in Arabidopsis thaliana plants is worthwhile to elucidate the contribution of these proteins to the tolerance mechanism to salt and drought.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that enhanced tolerance of oxidative stress would improve winter survival, two clones of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) were transformed with a Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) targeted to the mitochondria or to the chloroplast. Although Mn-SOD activity increased in most primary <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants,</b> both cytosolic and chloroplastic forms of Cu/Zn-SOD had lower activity in the chloroplast SOD <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> than in the nontransgenic plants. In a field trial at Elora, Ontario, Canada, the survival and yield of 33 primary <b>transgenic</b> and control <b>plants</b> were compared. After one winter most <b>transgenic</b> <b>plants</b> had higher survival rates than control plants, with some at 100 %.
