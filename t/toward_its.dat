After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position.

5|$|In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an {{interchange}} at Memorial Drive, {{which carries}} US-64 {{south of the}} toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway.

As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast.

5|$|MD 2 {{serves as}} a north–south route located a short {{distance}} {{to the west of}} the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert and Anne Arundel counties and in the city of Baltimore in Maryland. In Calvert County, the route runs through mostly rural areas, passing through the communities of Solomons Island, Lusby, Port Republic, Prince Frederick, Huntingtown, Sunderland, and Owings. Between Solomons Island and Sunderland, the route runs concurrent with MD 4. In Anne Arundel County, MD 2 runs through rural areas of the southern part of the county before reaching the Annapolis area, where it shares a concurrency with the John Hanson Highway. From Annapolis, the route heads through suburban areas in the northern part of Anne Arundel County as the Ritchie Highway, passing through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, and Brooklyn Park. It continues north into Baltimore, where it heads <b>toward</b> <b>its</b> terminus north of the downtown area. At , it is the longest state highway in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway through {{the small town of}} North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast <b>toward</b> <b>its</b> terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges <b>toward</b> <b>its</b> prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing <b>toward</b> <b>its</b> parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to the}} darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward <b>toward</b> <b>its</b> current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
