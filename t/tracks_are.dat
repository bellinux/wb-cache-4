5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar <b>tracks</b> <b>are</b> not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E
