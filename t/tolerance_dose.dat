25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To assess {{brachytherapy}} catheter {{positioning accuracy}} and {{to evaluate the}} effects of prolonged irradiation time on the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> of normal liver parenchyma following single-fraction irradiation with 192 Ir. Materials and methods Fifty patients with 76 malignant liver tumors treated by computed tomography (CT) -guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) {{were included in the}} study. The prescribed radiation dose was delivered by 1 - 11 catheters with exposure times in the range of 844 - 4432 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets for assessing irradiation effects on normal liver tissue, edema, and hepatocyte dysfunction, obtained 6 and 12 weeks after HDR-BT, were merged with 3 D dosimetry data. The isodose of the treatment plan covering the same volume as the irradiation effect was taken as a surrogate for the liver tissue <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose.</b> Catheter positioning accuracy was assessed by calculating the shift between the 3 D center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> volume for 38 irradiation effects in 30 patients induced by catheters implanted in nearly parallel arrangement. Effects of prolonged irradiation were assessed in areas where the irradiation effect volume and <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> volume did not overlap (mismatch areas) by using a catheter contribution index. This index was calculated for 48 irradiation effects induced by at least two catheters in 44 patients. Results Positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters was 5 - 6 mm. The orthogonal and axial shifts between the center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> volume in relation to the direction vector of catheter implantation were highly correlated and in first approximation identically in the T 1 -w and T 2 -w MRI sequences (p = 0. 003 and p p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively). There was a significant shift of the irradiation effect towards the catheter entry site compared with the planned dose distribution (p p Conclusions Positioning accuracy of brachytherapy catheters is sufficient for clinical practice. Reduced <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> in areas exposed to prolonged irradiation is contradictory to results published in the current literature. Effects of prolonged dose administration on the liver <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> for treatment times of up to 60 minutes per HDR-BT session are not pronounced compared to effects of positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters and are therefore of minor importance in treatment planning. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To assess radiobiological {{restrictions}} and tolerance doses {{as well as}} other toxic effects derived from repeated applications of single-fraction high dose rate irradiation of small liver volumes in clinical practice. Methods Twenty patients with liver metastases were treated repeatedly (2 - 4 times) at identical or intersecting locations by CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy with varying time intervals. Magnetic resonance imaging using the hepatocyte selective contrast media Gd-BOPTA was performed before and after treatment to determine the volume of hepatocyte function loss (called pseudolesion), and the last acquired MRI data set was merged with the dose distributions of all administered brachytherapies. We calculated the BED (biologically equivalent dose for a single dose d = 2 Gy) for different α/β values (2, 3, 10, 20, 100) based on the linear-quadratic model and estimated the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> for liver parenchyma D 90 as the BED exposing 90 % of the pseudolesion in MRI. Results The tolerance doses D 90 after repeated brachytherapy sessions were found between 22 - 24 Gy and proved only slightly dependent on α/β in the clinically relevant range of α/β = 2 - 10 Gy. Variance analysis showed a significant dependency of D 90 with respect to the intervals between the first irradiation and the MRI control (p 90 and the pseudolesion's volume. No symptoms of liver dysfunction or other toxic effects such as abscess formation occurred during the follow-up time, neither acute nor on the long-term.

40|$|Abstract Backround Hepatic {{radiation}} toxicity restricts irradiation of liver malignancies. Better knowledge of hepatic <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> is favourable to gain higher safety and to optimize radiation regimes in radiotherapy of the liver. In {{this study we}} sought to determine the hepatic <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> to small volume single fraction high dose rate irradiation. Materials and methods 23 liver metastases were treated by CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy. MRI was performed 3 days, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after therapy. MR-sequences were conducted with T 1 -w GRE enhanced by hepatocyte-targeted Gd-EOB-DTPA. All MRI data sets were merged with 3 D-dosimetry data. The reviewer indicated the border of hypointensity on T 1 -w images (loss of hepatocyte function) or hyperintensity on T 2 -w images (edema). Based on the volume data, a dose-volume-histogram was calculated. We estimated the threshold dose for edema or function loss as the D 90, i. e. the dose achieved in at least 90 % of the pseudolesion volume. Results At six weeks post brachytherapy, the hepatocyte function loss reached its maximum extending to the former 9. 4 Gy isosurface in median (i. e., ≥ 9. 4 Gy dose exposure led to hepatocyte dysfunction). After 12 and 24 weeks, the dysfunctional volume had decreased significantly to a median of 11. 4 Gy and 14 Gy isosurface, respectively, {{as a result of}} repair mechanisms. Development of edema was maximal at six weeks post brachytherapy (9. 2 Gy isosurface in median), and regeneration led to a decrease of the isosurface to a median of 11. 3 Gy between 6 and 12 weeks. The dose exposure leading to hepatocyte dysfunction was not significantly different from the dose provoking edema. Conclusion Hepatic injury peaked 6 weeks after small volume irradiation. Ongoing repair was observed up to 6 months. Individual dose sensitivity may differ as demonstrated by a relatively high standard deviation of threshold values in our own as well as all other published data. </p...|$|E

The features of radiation nephropathy seen post-treatment appear similar between local XRT, total-body irradiation (TBI), and radionuclide therapy. For uniform kidney irradiation, <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses</b> appear to be approximately 15 – 17 Gy in 2 Gy fractions for local XRT and probably less than this (12 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) when radiation is delivered systemically as TBI in the context of bone marrow transplant protocols. Animal studies indicate that the linear quadratic (LQ) model with an / parameter of 1. 5 – 3 Gy seems to ade-quately describe the XRT fractionation sensitivity of kidney for doses per fraction down to approximately 1 Gy, but may underestimate the effectiveness of fraction sizes less than this. Animal studies have also clarified the dose-dependency of the time to expression of radiation nephropathy and have indicated that radiation nephropathy may be alleviated by pharmacological means.
