2500|$|Stanley Hauerwas (born July 24, 1940) is an American theologian, ethicist, {{and public}} intellectual. Hauerwas was a {{longtime}} professor at Duke University, {{serving as the}} Gilbert <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Professor of Theological Ethics at Duke Divinity School with a joint appointment at the Duke University School of Law. In the fall of 2014, he also assumed a chair in Theological Ethics at the University of Aberdeen. Before moving to Duke and the University of Aberdeen, Hauerwas taught at the University of Notre Dame.

He was also the first American theologian to deliver the prestigious Gifford Lectures at St. Andrew's in Scotland in over forty years. His work is frequently read and debated by scholars in fields outside of religion or ethics, such as political philosophy, sociology, history, and literary theory. Hauerwas has achieved notability outside of academia as a public intellectual, even appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price kicked off more {{assertive}} growth than before, moving {{to its current}} location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price launched {{a joint venture with}} British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.|$|E
50|$|<b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price {{held its}} initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.

Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G. This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> Price International.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionConventional capsulolabral {{reconstruction}} for anterior shoulder instability fails with recurrent {{instability in}} up to 23 % of cases. Few studies have evaluated surgical revision strategies and outcomes. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes in a homogeneous series of surgical revisions after selective capsular repair (SCR). HypothesisObserved anatomic lesions can guide the choice between repeat SCR and coracoid transfer (Latarjet procedure). Materials and methodsFrom January 2005 to January 2009, 11 patients with trauma-related recurrent anterior shoulder instability (episodes of subluxation and/or dislocation) after SCR were included. Mean age was 31 years (range, 19 – 45 years). At revision, a glenoid bony defect was present in six patients. Repeat SCR was performed in five patients and coracoid transfer in six patients. ResultsAfter a mean follow-up of 40 months (range, 24 – 65 months), no patient had experienced further episodes of instability. However, four patients had a positive apprehension test. External rotation decreased significantly by more than 20 ° after both techniques. The Simple Shoulder <b>Test,</b> Walch-Duplay, and <b>Rowe</b> scores were 10. 5, 79, and 85, respectively. No patient had a subscapularis tear. Of these 11 patients, nine were able to resume their sporting activities and eight reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the subjective outcome. Radiographs showed fibrous non-union of the coracoid transfer in one patient. ConclusionIn patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability after SCR, repeat SCR and coracoid transfer produce similarly satisfactory outcomes. The size of the glenoid bone defect may be the best criterion for choosing between these two procedures. However, open revision surgery may decrease the range of motion, most notably in external rotation. Level of evidenceLevel IV...|$|R
