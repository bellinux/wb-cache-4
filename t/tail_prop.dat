25|$|A {{brand new}} Godzilla suit was {{designed}} for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance. Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film. These cut scenes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese theatrical trailer. Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The <b>tail</b> <b>prop</b> would be swung offscreen by a stage hand.|$|E

The first suit was rejected for being too fat with long legs giving Kong an almost cute look. A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|E
50|$|Some aquatic species, such as {{sirens and}} amphiumas, have reduced or absent hind limbs, giving them an eel-like appearance, {{but in most}} species, {{the front and rear}} limbs are about the same length and project sidewards, barely raising the trunk off the ground. The feet are broad with short digits, usually four on the front feet and five on the rear. Salamanders do not have claws, and the shape of the foot varies {{according}} to the animal's habitat. Climbing species have elongated, square-tipped toes, while rock-dwellers have larger feet with short, blunt toes. The tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp.) has plate-like webbed feet which adhere to smooth surfaces by suction, while the rock-climbing Hydromantes species from California have feet with fleshy webs and short digits and use their tails as an extra limb. When ascending, the <b>tail</b> <b>props</b> up the rear of the body, while one hind foot moves forward and then swings to the other side to provide support as the other hind foot advances.|$|R
5|$|Because {{it is both}} one of {{the first}} dinosaurs {{described}} and one of the best-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its <b>tail</b> to <b>prop</b> itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.|$|R
5000|$|European cave {{salamanders}} {{are found}} {{not only in}} caverns but on the ground among leaf litter, usually near streams, in wooded valleys. In the open air these salamanders are nocturnal, emerging in wet weather to forage but retreating in dry weather into caves and crevices or hiding beneath stones or logs. When underground they are active {{at any time of}} day. They are agile and can climb on rock outcrops or vertical cave walls, using their <b>tails</b> as <b>props.</b> The skin secretes toxic substances, which may deter predators, as may their habit of rolling their tail upwards.|$|R
50|$|They {{are small}} birds with a longish tail, a {{laterally}} flattened bill with an upturned tip (except in the slender-billed xenops), brown back and buff or rufous wing stripe. They forage for insects on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs, moving mechanically {{in all directions}} on the trunk like a woodcreeper, but without using the <b>tail</b> as a <b>prop.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like all {{nuthatch}}es, the {{red-breasted nuthatch}} is an acrobatic species, hitching itself {{up and down}} tree trunks and branches to look for food. It goes headfirst when climbing down. It can [...] "walk" [...] {{on the underside of}} branches. Unlike woodpeckers and creepers, it does not use its <b>tail</b> as a <b>prop</b> while climbing. It tends to forage singly or in pairs.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the Dash 8 design are the large T-tail intended to keep the <b>tail</b> free of <b>prop</b> wash during takeoff, a very high aspect ratio wing, the elongated engine nacelles also holding the rearward-folding landing gear, and the pointed nose profile. First flight was on June 20, 1983, and the airliner entered service in 1984 with NorOntair. In 1984, Piedmont Airlines, formerly Henson Airlines, was the first US customer for the Dash 8.|$|R
50|$|The {{plain xenops}} is often {{difficult}} to see as it forages for insects, including the larvae of wood-boring beetles, on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs. It moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its <b>tail</b> as a <b>prop.</b> It may be located by its sharp cheet call, or its song, a series of 5 or 6 trilled fit fit fit f’ f’f f’ notes. It regularly joins mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} in wet forests in foothills and {{mountains}} between 2,000-7,200 ft (600-2,200 m) ASL, and will utilize secondary forests and opened-up growth. The streaked xenops {{is often difficult to}} see as it forages on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs; it moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its <b>tail</b> as a <b>prop.</b> It feeds on arthropods such as the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but can also catch flying termites in mid-air. It joins mixed-species feeding flocks on a more or less regular basis depending on location, usually moving through the middle levels of the forest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{big-headed turtle}} {{is known to}} readily climb over {{obstacles}} in and around rivers and fast streams, using its <b>tail</b> as a <b>prop</b> to extend the reach of its strong claws; it also uses its beak to assist in climbing. [...] It {{has been reported to}} climb trees and bushes. It is not a strong swimmer, and when swimming, this species occasionally arches its tail {{in the manner of a}} scorpion. The big-headed turtle cannot pull its head in its shell. That being the case, it will not hesitate to use its powerful jaws to defend itself. It is a fish and snail eater.|$|R
2500|$|Gleaning {{birds are}} {{typically}} small with compact bodies and have small, sharply pointed bills. These features are even seen in gleaning birds {{that are not}} closely related. [...] For example, in flycatchers of the family Tyrannidae, in which some member species are more adapted for hawking insects on the wing and others for gleaning, the gleaners have bills that resemble those of tits and warblers, unlike their larger-billed relatives. Also, {{some members of the}} woodpecker family, particularly piculets such as the rufous piculet of Southeast Asia, are similarly adapted for gleaning, with small, compact bodies and sharp bills, rather than the long, supportive tails and wedge-shaped bills more typical of woodpeckers. Birds such as the aforementioned piculet are specialized for gleaning the bark of trees, as are nuthatches, woodcreepers, and treecreepers. [...] Most bark-gleaners work their way up tree trunks or along branches, though nuthatches are well known as the birds that can go the opposite direction, facing down and working their way down the trunk, as well. This requires strong legs and feet {{on the part of the}} nuthatch and piculet, while birds that face upwards tend to have stiff <b>tail</b> feathers to <b>prop</b> them up.|$|R
50|$|One to two eggs, {{typically}} two, {{are laid}} in each nest {{a day or}} two apart. The eggs weigh about 14.5 g and have an average size of 25.8 by 38.3 mm. The eggs are a creamy white with dark brown blotches spread across the egg but in higher density near the larger end. Incubation, which begins after the first egg is laid, lasts for 23 to 28 days. The parents take turns incubating their eggs. Hatching typically takes at least 12 hours. The infant rockfowl's eyes open after nine to eleven days, while feathers begin to grow seven days after hatching. After the young hatch, food is brought to them almost four times an hour. To feed its young, the adult rockfowl clings to the side of its nest while fluttering its wings; some birds use their <b>tails</b> as a <b>prop</b> underneath the nest to help support themselves. Rockfowl have been known to kill the young of other rockfowl, while nest predation is carried out by cobras of the genus Naja, the Nile monitor, sun squirrels, red-chested goshawks, and Procolobus monkeys. This leads on average to only 0.44 nestlings surviving per pair of rockfowl. Due to potential infanticide by other rockfowl, parents protect their nest and vicious fights often occur. Rare among other bird species, this behaviour is prevalent in white-necked rockfowl. Not fully understood, it is thought to occur for the sake of resource competition or sexual selection. The young leave the nest after 23 to 27 days, at which time they resemble the adult rockfowl but with much shorter tails. The young leave the nest by standing on the edge, emitting a piercing whistle, and then gliding down to the ground on spread wings where they are met by an adult bearing insects. Even after leaving the nest, the young return to roost on it with their parents.|$|R
