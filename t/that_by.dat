5|$|Accompanying the {{widespread}} printing of paper money was {{the beginnings of}} what one might term an early Chinese industrial revolution. For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> 1078 China was producing 127000000kg (125,000t) in weight of iron per year. However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).|$|E
