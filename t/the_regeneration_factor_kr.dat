40|$|We {{obtain the}} latitude-time {{distribution}} of the averaged tilt angle of solar bipoles. For large bipoles, which are mainly bipolar sunspot groups, the spatially averaged tilt angle is positive in the Northern solar hemisphere and negative in the Southern, with modest variations during course of the solar cycle. We consider the averaged tilt angle to be a tracer for a crucial element of the solar dynamo, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> rate of poloidal large-scale magnetic field from toroidal. The value of the tilt obtained crudely corresponds to a <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor</b> corresponding to about 10 % of r. m. s. velocity of solar convection. These results develop findings of Kosovichev and Stenflo (2012) concerning Joy's law, and agree with the usual expectations of solar dynamo theory. Quite surprisingly, we find a pronounced deviation from these properties for smaller bipoles, which are mainly solar ephemeral regions. They possess tilt angles of approximately the same absolute value, but of opposite sign {{compared to that of}} the large bipoles. Of course, the tilt data for small bipoles are less well determined than those for large bipoles; however they remain robust under various modifications of the data processing.

Location Three pasture sites in Guanacaste Province, a tropical seasonally dry area, Costa Rica. Methods Ninety isolated trees were characterized by their position in the landscape relative to patches of trees, individual structural variables related to tree and crown size, and species functional traits. The assemblage of woody plants regenerating under their crowns was characterized by number of individuals and species, and taxonomic and functional composition. To understand the mechanisms underlying the facilitative effect of isolated trees on regeneration, correlations between their attributes and properties of <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> assemblage were assessed. Results We found that a low proportion of regenerating individuals were conspecific with the isolated trees beneath which they have established. Landscape <b>factors</b> influenced <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> but their effects were site-dependent. The attributes of isolated trees correlated well with the functional composition of <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> assemblage: their structure and phenological habits with traits associated with drought tolerance, and their dispersal syndrome with the dispersal syndrome of <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> assemblage. However, isolated tree attributes correlated poorly with <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> assemblage's taxonomic composition. Conclusions Our study shows that an approach based on functional composition can provide a better understanding of community assembly mechanisms than does a taxonomic approach.

40|$|The {{dominant}} European {{forest policy}} {{objective is to}} create multifunctional, mixed-species and uneven-aged forests. This objective includes the nature‐oriented conversion of monospecific plantations. To reach this objective, close-to-nature silviculture is applied. This generally entails natural regeneration in canopy gaps. In the Netherlands, experience with gap-phase regeneration is limited, {{making it difficult to}} asses the effect of close-to-nature management on forest development. In this thesis, this problem is addressed by investigating species coexistence between the four dominant species that occur in naturally regenerated canopy gaps in Douglas fir forest in the Netherlands. These species are Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi Carr.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco). During gap‐phase regeneration, saplings undergo self‐thinning. This affects species composition of <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> unit. Important <b>factors</b> in self‐thinning are species‐specific morphological growth patterns, emergent stand characteristics, the effect of stand characteristics on competitive relationships, and the effect of light availability on growth and mortality. Growth patterns differed between species and resulted in differences in the achieved height per unit biomass. Differences in mass‐based heights subsequently caused a vertical stratification in <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> unit which, in turn, affected the interspecific competition for light. However, results demonstrated a competitive response rather than a competitive effect. Surrounding saplings formed a functionally equivalent neighborhood, and target individuals responded mainly to their position in the canopy. Canopy position affected the radial growth of saplings. Mortality probabilities depended on radial growth, but did not differ between species despite a wide range in light demand. Scots pine did not show a relation between growth and mortality, even though it is highly responsive to light. Under continued autogenic development, a low-density top stratum of Silver birch and Japanese larch will develop, overtopping a declining number of Scots pine and a large number of increasingly dominant Douglas fir. This implies that Scots pine will be outcompeted by the other species, and Douglas fir will gain dominance in the future. Forest conversion by natural regeneration will therefore not lead to the desired mixed-species composition, but stands will eventually revert back to Douglas fir forest. Maintaining a diverse forest thus means the need for interventions in the early developmental stage...|$|R

Our main objective was to study {{the existence of such}} a regeneration niche for a leguminous shrub, Ulex europaeus. This study was carried out in southwest France in the context of water and nutrient stresses (mainly phosphorus limitation) due to the presence of nutrient-poor sandy soils. We analysed <b>the</b> <b>regeneration</b> of <b>the</b> species from the germination of seeds and emergence of new seedlings until the seedlings reached young shrub size.
