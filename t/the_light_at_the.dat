5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B.

The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E

500|$|P.D. Hingley {{calls it}} [...] "One {{of the most}} charming and {{visually}} attractive of the many aids to astronomical self-instruction produced {{in the early nineteenth}} century". On its main gimmick, the holes in the stars meant to show the constellation when held in front of a light, he notes that, as the size of the holes marked correspond to the magnitude of the stars, a quite realistic depiction of the constellation is provided. Ian Ridpath mostly concurs. He describes the device as an [...] "attractive feature", but notes that, due to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time being provided primarily by candles, many cards likely burned up due to carelessness when trying to hold them in front of the flame. He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick—Franz Niklaus König's Atlas céleste (1826), Friedrich Braun's Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten (1850), and Otto Möllinger's Himmelsatlas (1851), but states that they lack Urania's Mirrors artistry.|$|E

500|$|Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who {{had studied}} at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An {{active member of the}} group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he {{exhibited}} in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison. Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting [...] (1890). The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall. Among the works he painted in Skagen are [...] (1884) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers, and the much brighter [...] (1885) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there will be something for the evening meal. After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903. In 1906, he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{presence}} of strong electrostatic fields it is predicted that virtual particles become separated from the vacuum state and form real matter. The fact that electromagnetic radiation can be transformed into matter and vice versa leads to fundamentally new features in quantum electrodynamics. One {{of the most important}} consequences is that, even in the vacuum, the Maxwell equations have to be exchanged by more complicated formulas. In general, it will be not possible to separate processes in the vacuum from the processes involving matter since electromagnetic fields can create matter if the field fluctuations are strong enough. This leads to highly complex nonlinear interaction - [...] gravity will have an effect on <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time the light has an effect on gravity. These effects were first predicted by Werner Heisenberg and Hans Heinrich Euler in 1936 and independently the same year by Victor Weisskopf who stated: [...] "The physical properties of the vacuum originate in the “zero-point energy” of matter, which also depends on absent particles through the external field strengths and therefore contributes an additional term to the purely Maxwellian field energy". Thus strong magnetic fields vary the energy contained in the vacuum. The scale above which the electromagnetic field is expected to become nonlinear is known as the Schwinger limit. At this point the vacuum has all the properties of a birefringent medium, thus in principle a rotation of the polarization frame (the Faraday effect) can be observed in empty space.|$|E
