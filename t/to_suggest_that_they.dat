5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{arguments}} behind {{an association of}} the chitinozoans with annelids or gastropods, {{and it is not}} impossible that the chitinozoans are a convergent phenomenon laid by both groups. In fact, the spirally coiled nature of chitinozoan chains has been used <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were laid by a spirally coiled organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, uncoiled chains could be to be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.|$|E

5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 {{the games}} {{industry}} was rocked {{by the news}} that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; {{the result was a}} pair of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: A Challenge of Arms (1998) and The Ritual of the Golden Eyes (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of Legendary Adventures, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish Lejendary Adventures in 1999. The game was published as a three-volume set: The Lejendary Rules for All Players (1999), Lejend Master's Lore (2000) and Beasts of Lejend (2000).|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons {{in close proximity to}} each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

5|$|Up to {{and after}} the {{discovery}} of the final component of the atomic nucleus, the neutron in 1932, most scientists did not seriously consider the possibility of elements heavier than uranium. While nuclear theory at the time did not explicitly prohibit their existence, there was little evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did. However, the discovery of induced radioactivity by Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie in late 1933 opened up an entirely new method of researching the elements and inspired a small group of Italian scientists led by Enrico Fermi to begin a series of experiments involving neutron bombardment. Although the Joliot-Curies' experiment involved bombarding a sample of 27Al with alpha particles to produce the radioactive 30P, Fermi realized that using neutrons, which have no electrical charge, would most likely produce even better results than the positively charged alpha particles. Accordingly, in March 1934 he began systematically subjecting all of the then-known elements to neutron bombardment to determine whether others could also be induced to radioactivity.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks.

The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two.

25|$|Tradition {{holds that}} {{following}} the Roman departure, Roman customs held {{on into the}} 5th century in southern Wales, and that is true in part.

An influx of settlers from southeastern Ireland {{had taken place in}} the late 4th century, both in northern Wales and in the entire region of southernmost and southwestern Wales under circumstances that are still poorly understood, and it seems far-fetched <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were ever Romanised.|$|E
