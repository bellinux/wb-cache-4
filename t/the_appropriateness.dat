This research was descriptive qualitative that was supported by quantitative data. The textbooks were evaluated using Krippendorf’s content analysis (2004 : 83) : unitizing, sampling, coding, reducing data, inferring contextual phenomena, and narrating the result. Criteria used were from Pedoman Penilaian Buku Teks Pelajaran Bahasa Inggris developed by the Board of National Education Standard Team, the Ministry of National Education (2007). The data were collected through observations, interview, and C-Test. The research took place in nine SMANs in Banjarmasin from January 2012 to May 2012. The respondents were all of the 102 eleventh grade students and nine English teachers. The validity used democratic validity and triangulation while the reliability used inter-coder reliability. The democratic validity was reached through giving all school components like principals, teachers, and students chances to speak while the triangulation was through experts’ crosscheck. The inter-coders were given the needed data that should be ticked then concluded and counted the mean so that the final conclusion was more objective. The result of the study shows as follows.

5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients.

Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E
5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} nurses {{independently}} prescribing medicines in England is rising steadily. There {{had been no}} attempt systematically to evaluate <b>the</b> clinical <b>appropriateness</b> of nurses' prescribing decisions. AIMS: (i) To establish a method of assessing <b>the</b> clinical <b>appropriateness</b> of nurses' prescribing decisions; (ii) to evaluate the prescribing decisions of a sample of nurses, using this method. METHOD: A modified version of <b>the</b> Medication <b>Appropriateness</b> Index (MAI) was developed, piloted and subsequently used by seven medical prescribing experts to rate transcripts of 12 nurse prescriber consultations selected from a larger database of 118 audio-recorded consultations collected {{as part of a}} national evaluation. Experts were also able to give written qualitative comments on each of the MAI dimensions applied to each of the consultations. ANALYSIS: Experts' ratings were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative comments were subjected to a process of content analysis to identify themes within and across both MAI items and consultations. RESULTS: Experts' application of the modified MAI to transcripts of nurse prescriber consultations demonstrated validity and feasibility as a method of assessing <b>the</b> clinical <b>appropriateness</b> of nurses' prescribing decisions. In the majority of assessments made by the expert panel, nurses' prescribing decisions were rated as clinically appropriate on all nine items in the MAI. CONCLUSION: A valid and feasible method of assessing <b>the</b> clinical <b>appropriateness</b> of nurses' prescribing practice has been developed using a modified MAI and transcripts of audio-recorded consultations sent to a panel of prescribing experts. Prescribing nurses in this study were generally considered to be making clinically appropriate prescribing decisions. This approach to measuring prescribing appropriateness could be used as part of quality assurance in routine practice, as a method of identifying continuing professional development needs, or in future research as the expansion of non-medical prescribing continues. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—There is {{a rising}} concern among parents that mobile {{advertisements}} may contain violent and sexual content {{even when the}} app itself is safe for children. Because mobile advertisements are not controlled by the content rating of apps, unexpected objectionable contents may occur and be harmful to children’s mental health. This study {{is the first to}} explore <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> of <b>the</b> in-app advertisements on mobile devices from children’s online safety perspective. We find in-app advertisements are common in the free apps designed for children on smart platforms. Experimental results show that a large percent of the in-app advertisements carry inappropriate contents for children. Unfortunately, neither mobile platforms nor advertising networks provide maturity policies to restrict <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> of <b>the</b> in-app advertisements. This research suggests that these challenges cannot easily be tackled by one entity. Instead, advertisement providers, advertising networks, app developers, and mobile platforms should collaborate in developing policies and mechanisms to monitor <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> of <b>the</b> in-app advertisements.
