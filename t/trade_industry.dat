40|$|Incorporating {{explicitly}} {{division of}} labor into a two-country general oligopolistic equilibrium model, we examine the firm productivity effect of trade liberalization and its welfare implication. We show that a tariff reduction increases the firm productivity of the <b>trading</b> <b>industries</b> but decreases that of the non-trading industries. An expansion of the <b>trading</b> <b>industries,</b> in contrast, decreases the firm productivity of both the <b>trading</b> and non-trading <b>industries.</b> We then find that a tariff reduction necessarily reduces welfare while the welfare effect of expansion of <b>trading</b> <b>industries</b> is ambiguous...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} the differences in the postdisplacement labor market experiences of workers separated from declining traded, expanding <b>traded</b> and nontraded <b>industries.</b> The results presented provide the beginnings of a bridge across the gap between what is known and what is perceived regarding the allocative efficiency effects of trade-related labor displacements. The strategy of the paper is to relate the postdisplacement experience of individuals to changes in the competitive position of the industry from which the individual was displaced. The investigative lens is primarily focused on the impact of changing industry competitiveness on the duration of unemployment spells and the change in wages accompanying displacement. The findings are that workers from <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> in general suffer greater hardhip after displacement than do nontraded workers. They incur both a longer spell of unemployment and a greater loss of earnings. Within <b>traded</b> <b>industries,</b> workers separated from declining <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> fare much worse than those from expanding <b>traded</b> <b>industries.</b> This evidnece regarding the duration of the unemployment spell is then combined with previous results regarding trade related displacements to provide an accounting of the change in the aggregatenumber of weeks of unemployment resulting from changing trade patterns. The finding is that although expansion of <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> was sufficient to offset the displacement effects of contracting <b>traded</b> <b>industries,</b> the longer spell of unemployment by those from contracting industries results in a significant increase unemployed resources...|$|R

Norway may not discriminate—based on nationality—the rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, <b>trade,</b> <b>industry</b> and maritime activity.

Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The non-discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not fall under the non-discrimination clause.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{relates the}} postdisplacement {{experience}} {{of individuals to}} changes in the competitive position of the industry, vis a vis the rest of the world, from which the individual was displaced. The focus is on the duration of unemployment spells and the change in wages accompanying displacement. Controlling for demographic character-istics, we find that workers from declining <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> suffer greater hardship after displacement than do workers from nontraded or expanding <b>traded</b> <b>industries.</b> They incur both a longer spell of unemployment and a greater loss of earnings. Furthermore, workers separated from expanding <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> fare better than those from other industries. This evidence regarding the duration of the unemployment spell is then combined with previous results regarding the volume of trade related displacements to provide an accounting of the change in the aggregate number of weeks of unemployment resulting from changing trade patterns. Although the expansion of some <b>traded</b> <b>industries</b> was sufficient to offset the displacement effects of contracting <b>traded</b> <b>industries,</b> the longer spell of unemployment incurred by those displaced from contracting industries is found to result in a significant increase in unemployed resources...|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{change in}} value added {{coefficient}} {{had a positive}} correlation with change in DVA of each kind of export. Using data from China’s 41 -sector DPN table, we found that in 2002 – 2007, 22 processing <b>trade</b> <b>industries</b> increase their value added coefficients and the value added coefficients of 37 normal <b>trade</b> <b>industries</b> also increased. In 2007 – 2010, 16 out of the 41 processing <b>trade</b> <b>industries</b> saw a decrease in their value added coefficients and the value added coefficient also decreased in 39 non-processing trade sectors. In 2002 – 2007, this factor therefore had {{a positive effect on}} exported DVA, while in 2007 – 2010 it had a negative effect.|$|R
5|$|Despite this decision, Bird {{returned}} to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a {{transfer to the}} Ministry of <b>Trade,</b> <b>Industry</b> and Business Development following the 1999 general election.

The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved in politics, and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{the city}} entered {{a period of}} rapid growth and the service sector overtook <b>trade,</b> <b>industry</b> and crafts as the leading sector of {{employment}} for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by {{the framers of the}} Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any <b>trade,</b> <b>industry</b> or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E

5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any <b>trade,</b> <b>industry,</b> or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
