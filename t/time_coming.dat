5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked {{as one of the}} most expensive video game projects at the <b>time,</b> <b>coming</b> in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, several {{military}} expeditions sent by Spanish colonists from coastal California traveled into the Central Valley. One of these trips, headed by lieutenant Gabriel Moraga, {{arrived on the}} south bank of the Merced River on September 29, 1806. They named the river Rio de Nuestra Señora de la Merced (River of Our Lady of Mercy), who is {{the patron saint of}} the diocese of Barcelona and is celebrated on September 24. Another expedition to the Central Valley in 1805 also named the Kings River upon reaching it on January 6, 1805, which is the feast of the Magi or Epiphany. Moraga's expedition was part of a series of exploratory ventures, funded by the Spanish government, to find suitable sites for missions in the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. In 1808 and 1810, Moraga led further expeditions along the lower Merced River below Merced Canyon, each <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> to nothing. Eventually, plans to establish a mission chain in the Valley were abandoned. In 1855, Merced County was created, named after the Merced River.|$|E

She has twice set season goal-scoring records while playing in the league, with the second <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> in a 2010 game when her team beat Adelaide at home in the Sutherland Leisure Centre. She challenges opposition players {{in such a way that}} it frequently results in her fouling out of games. She was the captain of the team during the 2011 season. In 2012, she played briefly with the club before taking a break from the team following their 18 February 2012 game to attend the national team training camp. Her last game before the break was against the Balmain Tigers. As a member of the team, she helped win the first two games of the season 8–4 and 7–4.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.34 (Transport) Squadron {{was established}} on 23February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, {{four days after}} the city was bombed for the first <b>time.</b> <b>Coming</b> under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two deHavilland DH.84 Dragons. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5March. On 14March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1July, {{a few days after the}} plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron relocated again on 15July, this time to Hughes Airfield. It remained at Hughes until 27August, when it transferred to Manbulloo Airfield; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13December and its aircraft transferred to No.6 Communications Flight.|$|E

25|$|The Philippine Revolution {{began in}} 1896. Rizal was wrongly {{implicated in the}} {{outbreak}} of the revolution and executed for treason in 1896. The Katipunan in Cavite split into two groups, Magdiwang, led by Mariano Álvarez (a relative of Bonifacio's by marriage), and Magdalo, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. Leadership conflicts between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo culminated in the execution or assassination of the former by the latter's soldiers. Aguinaldo agreed to a truce with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were exiled to Hong Kong. Not all the revolutionary generals complied with the agreement. One, General Francisco Makabulos, established a Central Executive Committee to serve as the interim government until a more suitable one was created. Armed conflicts resumed, this <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> from almost every province in Spanish-governed Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then.

But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day.

This was the first time this had been accomplished since the Columbus Crew achieved it in 2008. In the 2011 MLS Cup final, the Galaxy defeated the Houston Dynamo, 10 off a 72nd minute Donovan goal. The goal was scored off a Galaxy counter where Beckham fed a through ball to Donovan who slotted it past Hall. The 2012 final featured both the Galaxy and Dynamo again, making it the first since 2007 that an MLS Cup final was a rematch of the previous final. Again, the Galaxy won the final, this <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> from behind to defeat the Dynamo by a 31 scoreline. The match was Beckham's final MLS match.|$|E

A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms {{were added to the}} suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|E
