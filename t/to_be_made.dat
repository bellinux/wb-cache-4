5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how the 1913 nickels came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> The Mint's records show no production of 1913 Liberty head nickels, and none were authorized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> Dies were prepared {{in advance and}} sent to California for a 1913-S Liberty Head nickel coinage, but upon orders from Mint Director Roberts in December 1912 to end the old design, they were returned to Philadelphia. They were received by December 23, and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early January. Brown had been an employee at the Philadelphia Mint (although this was not known until 1963) and many theories focus suspicion on him.|$|E
