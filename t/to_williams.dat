5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> {{the game}} was {{difficult}} to market, as the team wanted to prevent spoiling the narrative yet encourage people to buy the game. He added that the demo they released was unrepresentative of the final game. Williams expected the game to be sold through word of mouth promotion {{and that it would}} eventually become a cult classic.|$|E
5|$|Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian racing {{driver who}} won three Formula One world championships. He entered Formula One in 1984 with the Toleman team, but after one season, {{he moved to}} Lotus. He spent three seasons with Lotus before moving to McLaren in 1988. Over the next five years, the intense rivalry between Senna and Alain Prost, a leading Formula One driver, came to the forefront, with {{particularly}} notable race incidents and collisions occurring between the two. Senna won all three of his world championships during his six seasons with McLaren, in 1988, 1990 and 1991. He wanted to move <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> after 1992, but was prevented from doing so by a clause in Alain Prost's contract. He moved <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> in 1994, but during the third race of the season, {{he was killed in}} an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era, and is considered by some as the greatest racing driver of all time.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting {{he was pleased}} with the eventual decision. Webber's move <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, also in a Williams. Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E

5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E
5|$|The 2000/2001 {{season was}} O'Sullivan's most {{successful}} to date: winning two ranking titles and four non-ranking titles. O'Sullivan started the season by reaching the final in {{three out of}} the first four tournaments: winning the Champions Cup by defeating Mark Williams 7–5 in the final after being 1–4 behind, coming runner-up <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> 5–9 at the Grand Prix, and winning the Scottish Masters by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–6 in the final. He also recorded a quarter-final run at the British Open, losing to 3–5 Peter Ebdon. At the UK Championship: O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy Michie 9–2 in the last 32, Dave Harold 9–5 in the last 16, Quinten Hann 9–5 in the quarter-finals, before losing <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> 4–9 in the semi-finals. O'Sullivan then successfully defended his China Open title, defeating Williams 9–3 in the final. He became the seventh player in snooker history to defend a world-ranking tournament.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E
5|$|During {{her stay}} at the camp, she would alert the prisoners to the {{approach}} of the Japanese guards and also if other animals such as snakes or scorpions were around. She also made excursions from the camp, looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes <b>to</b> <b>Williams.</b> Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to the camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{continued}} to box regularly in New York State losing to Frankie Notter in June and then recording a draw with George Ashe in July. Dyer {{appears to have}} forgone fighting for over a year, but {{then returned to the}} ring in July 1917, both contests held at the Rochester Airdome. He was given his first win since arriving in America in his encounter with Willie Langford but this was followed by another loss, this time to Bryan Downey. On 28 September 1917, Dyer fought in Boston, Massachusetts, facing local fighter Tommy Robson, in which the referee declared a draw. His next fight, against Frankie Maguire in Pennsylvania, was given to Dyer by the Philadelphia Record after the fight went the distance. Dyer's next fight was against Lew Williams, which was given <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> by the New York Evening Telegram, though The New York Sun believed Dyer shaded the match with more precise punching.|$|E

Betty remained in Indiana, and while he was away his first child, Scott, was born. After his birth they joined Grissom in Arizona. The family remained there only briefly and in December 1951 they moved to Presque Isle, Maine, where Grissom was assigned to Presque Isle Air Force Base and {{became a member of the}} 75th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Northwestern placekicker Brian Gowins {{kicked a}} career-best 52-yard field goal to put Northwestern ahead 3–0 {{in the first}} quarter. Michigan took the lead with 13 {{points in the second}} quarter, {{starting}} with 19-yard and 23-yard field goals by Baker. With 1:02 left in the half, Griese threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Tuman. Gowin kicked a second field goal early in the third quarter, but missed a 47-yarder {{at the end of the}} quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, Michigan sustained a 70-yard scoring drive that consumed five-and-a-half minutes on the game clock. During the drive, Griese completed 5-of-6 passes for 51 yards, including a 22-yard pass to Streets, a 16-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> and a 2-yard touchdown pass to Tuman. When Northwestern got the ball back, Woodson intercepted a Tim Hughes pass and returned it two yards to the Northwestern 30. Michigan added a 26-yard field goal by Baker with 7:28 remaining to complete the scoring.|$|E
5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving {{much of the}} blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|When Unearthed Arcana was {{released}} in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, Artifact of Evil. The financial crisis had been averted, but ironically Gygax had {{paved the way for}} his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> but he lost.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> it is {{possible}} that after Sveinn defeated Ölvir and Frakökk, Ölvir may have fled to kinsmen of his in the Suðreyjar. Williams suggested that the blood feud between the families may be a reason for Sveinn's military activities in the Hebrides and the Isle of Mann, afterwards; although Sveinn had other interests in the area, since he is stated to have married the window of a Manx king. In the late 19th century, antiquary F.W.L. Thomas speculated that the memory of Ölvir may have been preserved in the Hebrides. Thomas stated that within the mythological history of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, the island clan of Macaulays were said to be the descendants of a man named Amhlaebh, {{who was one of the}} twelve sons, or near relations, of a man named Oliver, among whom Lewis was divided. This Oliver was said to have been the eldest son of the Norse king who was given the Isles and Highlands by a son of Kenneth MacAlpin, for his assistance in driving his own brother from Scotland. Thomas speculated that Oliver could represent Ölvir Rósta; meaning that he was the progenitor of the Macaulays.|$|E

5|$|After Floyd Mayweather, Jr. {{defeated}} Zab Judah on April 8, 2006, {{he rejected}} an $8million offer from promoter Bob Arum to fight Margarito on August 12, 2006, citing a hand injury {{as the reason}} {{he did not take}} the bout. On December 2, 2006, Margarito successfully defended the WBO welterweight title for the seventh time with a unanimous decision victory over Joshua Clottey. On July 14, 2007, Margarito fought Paul Williams in his eighth title defense at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. With a victory, Margarito would set up himself up for a welterweight title unification match against Miguel Cotto in the autumn, but Margarito lost <b>to</b> <b>Williams</b> by unanimous decision. Four months later, Margarito knocked out Golden Johnson in the first round at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On April 12, 2008, Margarito had a rematch with Kermit Cintron, who held the IBF welterweight title. The match took place on the undercard of Cotto's fight with Alfonso Gomez and Margarito knocked out Cintron in the sixth round to win the title.|$|E
5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According <b>to</b> <b>Williams,</b> it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} by North Carolina {{and a short}} return, Virginia Tech took over at its 26-yard line. On Tech's first play, Clark {{completed}} a seven-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Williams.</b> Running back Lamont Pegues then was stopped for a one-yard loss, and Clark's third-down pass attempt fell incomplete. After again going three and out, Tech punted. The kick was returned to the North Carolina 14-yard line, and the Tar Heels began their third possession of the game. The first play of the drive was a pass from Keldorf to Crumpler, who gained 10 yards and a first down. From the Tar Heels' 24-yard line, Linton gained one yard on a short run, then Keldorf threw a 30-yard pass to wide receiver Na Brown. The play gave the Tar Heels a first down at the Tech 44-yard line, and Linton gained four yards with a running play on first down. Two incomplete passes later, North Carolina punted {{for the first time}} in the game. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and the Hokies' offense started at the 20-yard line with 2:49 left in the quarter.|$|E
