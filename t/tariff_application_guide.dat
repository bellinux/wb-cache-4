40|$|Application In the {{stakeholder}} consultation {{meeting on the}} AESO’s 2010 <b>tariff</b> <b>application</b> held on April 15, 2009, the AESO discussed the formation of several small working groups to explore specific topics for its 2010 <b>tariff</b> <b>application.</b> This letter provides additional information on those working groups, including draft terms of reference, and invites stakeholders to participate on them. At the April 15 meeting, stakeholders suggested a two-round signup process to establish participation on the working groups. The AESO proposes the following process. (1) In the first round, stakeholders are requested to indicate on the enclosed sign-up form the working groups on which {{they are interested in}} participating. Completed forms are to be returned by Wednesday, April 29, 2009, to April Walters at april. walters@aeso. ca. (2) The AESO will post the list of first-round working group participants on its website on Thursday, April 30, 2009, and will also distribute the list by email to those who signed up. (3) In the second round, stakeholders can ask to participate on additional working groups or to be removed from one or more working groups that they had signed up for in the first round. This will allow stakeholders to balance their participation among the working groups, and avoid duplication on groups where their interest may already be adequately represented. The AESO may also suggest changes during the second round to ensure diversity and balanced representation of views on working groups.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} Joint Deployable Intelligence Support System (JDISS) Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users. These two applications, together, are the core of the JDISS program. Both applications were examined to identify functions and processes that are difficult to understand as well as functions and processes that lack sufficient instructions for new users. The supporting JDISS Desktop and Utilities applications were added to provide the knowledge base required for the new user to use the <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> as a stand-alone document. Other JDISS applications, such as Office Tools, E-mail, Intelink, etc., are not included due, in part, to a common thread with other programs that the new user should already be familiar with, but mostly due to the adequate help instructions readily available within the JDISS main desktop help function. The JDISS program was developed to ensure that each of the U. S. Services and Agencies had an integrated intelligence system, and one that would provide a common data standard permitting interoperability both intra-service and inter- service. The Joint Staff, Director of Intelligence (J 2), has highlighted JDISS in joint doctrine as the principal intelligence component for interoperability (JBOC, 1996). Therefore, this detailed, step-by-step JDISS Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users was developed and designed to help future JDISS users worldwide.
