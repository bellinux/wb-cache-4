40|$|The overall issue {{addressed}} in {{this paper is to}} improve semantic interoperability among and across agent systems. We propose to use explanation as a way to approach that aim. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> process is expressed in terms of an explanation ontology shared by the agents who participate to <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> session. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> ontology is defined in a way general enough to support a variety of <b>explanation</b> mechanisms. <b>The</b> paper describes <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> ontology and provides a working through example illustrating how the proposed generic ontology can be used to develop specific <b>explanation</b> mechanism.

5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. <b>The</b> <b>Explanations</b> have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E
5|$|The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are {{a list of}} propositions for an {{academic}} disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, that started the Reformation, a schism in the Catholic Church which profoundly changed Europe. They advance Luther's positions against {{what he saw as}} abusive in the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in <b>the</b> <b>Explanations</b> of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} {{an assessment of the}} completeness of an explanation can be used to control inference in a plan recognition system: If <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> is complete, inference is stopped. If <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> is incomplete, inference is continued. If it cannot be determined whether <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> is complete, then the system weighs the strength of its interest in continuing the analysis against the estimated cost of doing so. This algorithm places existing heuristic approaches to the control of inference in plan recognition into a unified framework. The algorithm rests on the principle that the decision to continue processing should be based primarily on <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> chain itself, not on external factors. Only when an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> chain proves inconclusive should outside factors weigh heavily in the decision. Furthermore, a decision to discontinue chaining should never be final; other components of the system should have the opportunity to request that an explanat [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing <b>the</b> <b>explanations</b> of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E
