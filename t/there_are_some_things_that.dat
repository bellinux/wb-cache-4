500|$|In the 1980s, Alvin Plantinga {{presented}} {{a version of}} the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory. To do this, Plantinga believed that a [...] "possible state of affairs" [...] must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent. He argued that a third proposition– that evil {{is the result of the}} actions of free, rational, fallible human beings– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent. Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable. Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Seth MacFarlane responded to Palin's criticism, saying that the series always uses satire as the basis of its humor, and that the show is an [...] "equal-opportunity offender." [...] In addition, Andrea Fay Friedman, who voiced Ellen, and who herself has Down syndrome, also responded to the criticisms saying that the joke was aimed at Sarah Palin and not her son, and that [...] "former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor." [...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin, accusing her of using her son, Trig, as a political prop to pander for votes, saying that she has a normal life and that Palin's son should be treated as normal, rather than like a [...] "loaf of French bread." [...] Later, MacFarlane addressed both Palin's statement and Friedman's rebuttal in an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher calling Palin's outrage a presumptuous attempt to defend people with Down syndrome, and characterizing Friedman's statement as her way of saying that she does not need feigned pity from Palin. Family Guy cast member Patrick Warburton stated that he objected to the joke, saying, [...] "I know {{that you have to be}} an equal-opportunity offender, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I just don't think are funny." [...] While frequent MacFarlane critic Parents Television Council touched on the Palin controversy in its assessment of the episode, the rest of the show's content—which contained [...] "mean-spirited pot-shots, explicit language, and strong sexual content"—earned the watchdog group's [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] title. The PTC specifically cited the Broadway-style song, which the PTC said [...] "contained all the stereotypes of mental retardation" [...] and [...] "disturbing sexual references," [...] and the climatic scene in the subplot, where Peter pretends to be a psychic, which the PTC said also contained sexual humor.|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 22, Sondheim had {{finished}} the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Julius and Philip Epstein's Front Porch in Flatbush, unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by Lemuel (Lem) Ayers. Ayers approached Frank Loesser and another composer, who turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; Julius Epstein flew in from California and hired Sondheim, {{who worked with him}} in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled Saturday Night, was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of leukemia in his early forties. The rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned; it opened off-Broadway in 2000. Sondheim later said, [...] "I don't have any emotional reaction to Saturday Night at all – except fondness. It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes.
