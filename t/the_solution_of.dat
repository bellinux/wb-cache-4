5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> the original Apollonius problem is obtained from <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

25|$|Each {{method has}} {{noteworthy}} limitations. The method of {{mechanics of materials}} is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> elasticity problems also requires <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> a system of partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> mechanics of materials problems, which require at most <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method {{is perhaps the most}} restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.|$|E
