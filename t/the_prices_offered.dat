For example, it is storied that once he was approached by a prospective buyer who wanted to buy Safra's merchandise, but Safra {{was in the midst of}} reciting the Shema prayer, and thus could not reply.

50|$|Even {{with the}} Townshend duty in effect, the Tea Act {{would allow the}} East India Company to sell tea more cheaply than before, {{undercutting}} <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>offered</b> by smugglers, but also undercutting colonial tea importers, who paid the tax and received no refund. In 1772, legally imported Bohea, the most common variety of tea, sold for about 3 shillings (3s) per pound. After the Tea Act, colonial consignees {{would be able to}} sell it for 2 shillings per pound (2s), just under the smugglers' price of 2 shillings and 1 penny (2s 1d). Realizing that the payment of the Townshend duty was politically sensitive, the company hoped to conceal the tax by making arrangements to have it paid either in London once the tea was landed in the colonies, or have the consignees quietly pay the duties after the tea was sold. This effort to hide the tax from the colonists was unsuccessful.|$|E

Faced with eviction for failure to pay taxes, in 1939 she invited the press to witness her mutilating her own sculptures as a protest against her circumstances, and against the failure to realize her dream of a studio-museum commemorating suffragettes and other women's campaigners.

40|$|This paper, after {{providing}} {{an introduction to}} the operating context of low cost carriers in Europe, examines the competitive pricing behaviour of airlines. Data is collected by route for cases where more than one airline is in direct competition. Data on fares is obtained from the internet for two airlines with competing services to Alicante, Prague and Malaga, departing from Nottingham East Midlands Airport in the UK, for the six working weeks up to and including the actual departure. These destinations represent leisure traffic. Two domestic business destinations were also selected to illustrate price competition on business demand where departure times were within a maximum of 20 minutes of each other and a further examination of competing services from London Gatwick (LGW) was made. Cross Correlation Analysis is used to examine whether, subject to a variety of lags, <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>offered</b> by one airline can be seen to be both correlated with the other price series and to lead it. This provides some insight into the pricing strategy adopted by the competitors. Autocorrelation Functions (ACFs) and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (PACFs) can also be produced on <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>offered</b> by each airline. These suggest the nature of the ARIMA model that can be fitted to the series and these models can show the degree to which series values are correlated with their own past values and whether a reasonable model could be based on an ARIMA approach. The relative strength of these two relationships is examined; are prices more closely explained by the competitor's actions or the airlines own past price setting...|$|E

In contrast, we show that if one is allowed to introduce discontinuities (by deleting vertices) the optimization problem becomes computationally hard, and we exhibit algorithms for special classes of graphs. We also study a stochastic model, and show that a similar contrast exists there: For pricing without discontinuities the benefit of differential pricing over a single price is negligible, while for differential pricing with discontinuities the difference is substantial...|$|E

The circumstances under which claims may arise are reviewed in relation to typical conditions of contract. These circumstances are then related to the CERN LHC civil works. Ways of avoiding claims, where this is possible, are considered. Finally, the means of evaluation of claims and their settlement are considered...|$|R
