25|$|Woman with a Horse was {{conceived}} {{in such a}} way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, piecing together the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during the painting process). Only then do the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something quasi-static to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject.|$|E

30|$|In speech recognition, hidden Markov {{modeling}} (HMM) {{has been}} the dominant approach since it provides a principled way of jointly modeling speech spectral variations and time dynamics. However, HMM has the shortcoming of assuming the observations being independent within each state, which makes it ineffective in modeling the fine details of speech <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> {{that are important in}} characterizing nonstationary speech sounds [1]. Time derivatives of cepstral coefficients [2] are widely used to supplement time dynamic information to speech feature distributions. Trajectory model [3] introduces time-varying covariance modeling to capture <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> of speech features. Additionally, approaches like segment models [4, 5] and long-contextual-span model of resonance dynamics [6] have been proposed for similar purposes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> toward thermal equilibria are numerically {{investigated}} in a Hamiltonian system with many {{degrees of freedom}} which has second order phase transition. Relaxation processes are studied through local order parameter, and slow relaxations of power type are observed at the critical energy of phase transition for some initial conditions. Numerical results are compared with results of a phenomenological theory of statistical mechanics. At the critical energy, the maximum Lyapunov exponent takes the largest value. <b>Temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> and probability distributions of local Lyapunov exponents show {{that the system is}} highly chaotic rather than weakly chaotic at the critical energy. Consequently theories for perturbed systems may not be applied to the system at the critical energy in order to explain the slow relaxation of power type. ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} fully specify the Bayesian network and thus fully {{represent}} the joint probability distribution, {{it is necessary}} to specify for each node X the probability distribution for X conditional upon Xs parents. The distribution of X conditional upon its parents may have any form. It is common to work with discrete or Gaussian distributions since that simplifies calculations. Sometimes only constraints on a distribution are known; one can then use the principle of maximum entropy to determine a single distribution, the one with the greatest entropy given the constraints. (Analogously, in the specific context of a dynamic Bayesian network, one commonly specifies the conditional distribution for the hidden state's <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> to maximize the entropy rate of the implied stochastic process.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The above {{assumption}} {{may seem}} non-intuitive at first: {{how can an}} ensemble which is time-invariant have a non-uniform temporal correlation function? Temporal correlations remain relevant to talk about in equilibrium systems because a time-invariant, macroscopic ensemble can still have non-trivial temporal dynamics microscopically. One example is in diffusion. A single-phase system at equilibrium has a homogeneous composition macroscopically. However, if one watches the microscopic movement of each atom, fluctuations in composition are constantly occurring due to the quasi-random walks taken by the individual atoms. Statistical mechanics allows one to make insightful statements about the temporal behavior of such fluctuations of equilibrium systems. This is discussed below in the section on the <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> of correlation functions and [...] Onsager's regression hypothesis.|$|E

Furthermore, {{it is assumed that}} each user is motionless during its call. In this model, spatial birth-and-death processes, which are, in a way, spatial extensions of (time-only) queueing models (for example, Erlang loss systems and processor sharing models), are used in this context to evaluate time averages of the user QoS metrics. Queueing models [...] have been successfully used to dimension (or to suitably adjust the parameters of) circuit-switched and other communication networks. Adapting these models to the task of the dimensioning of the radio part of wireless cellular networks requires appropriate space-time averaging over the network geometry and the <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> of the user [...] (phone call) arrival process.|$|E
40|$|In {{artificial}} intelligence {{there is a}} great need to represent temporal knowledge and to reason about models that capture change over time. Change seems to be constant in a continuously changing world. In many domains such as science, medicine, finance, and demographics, change is noticeable from one time to another. The thesis work aims at first extending FCA to capture <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> (TFCA) represented by concept lattices in time-stamped databases, and at applying the extended FCA techniques to data mining with an endeavor of inferring temporal properties. Extending formal concept analysis to temporal domains allows us to use concept lattices to visualize <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions</b> and deduce insights on the hidden regularities in the data. To represent <b>temporal</b> <b>evolutions,</b> formal entities are time indexed. Temporal edges are added to concept lattices to show <b>evolutions.</b> Important <b>temporal</b> properties such as class evolution, persistence, and transition are classified and a mechanism for inferring them is presented. Algorithms for inferring temporal properties and generating temporal lattices from time-stamped databases are developed, implemented, and tested. Dept. of Computer Science.

Various tools allow end users to interpret these data without having to browse the whole data set.

2500|$|Spontaneous {{activity}} is brain {{activity in the}} absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. [...] The term ongoing brain {{activity is}} used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. [...] Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as alpha waves, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The <b>temporal</b> <b>evolution</b> of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.|$|E
