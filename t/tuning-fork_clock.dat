40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{establish}} an equivalent electrical network of the <b>tuning-fork</b> <b>clock</b> of magnetic escapement type, considering the mechanism of energy conversion from electrical energy to mechanical one. When we design or analyze the magnetic escapement, it is very useful for us to express the mechanism by equivalent circuit, because these considerations {{make it possible to}} be treated the problems as a transmission circuit. 　The paper presents the fundamental equations of the energy conversion for the mechanism of magnetic coupling between tuning-fork vibrator and escape wheel, and derives an equivalent electrical circuit from the equations. The paper proposes, moreover, a principle of optimum design for the magnetic escapement type clock under the transmission theory with the equivalent circuit. These will be developed to study the problem, hereafter. 　Lastly, in appendix, it explaines the procedure of calcuiating the value of each element of the equivalent circuit, and, for reference, it adds another consideration by image parameter for the design of the equipment...|$|E
