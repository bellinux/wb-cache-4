500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song on Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, her second Thanksgiving television special which aired on ABC on November 28, 2013. She had invited singer Elton John as special guest star for the performance. After {{a performance of}} John's 1974 single [...] "Bennie and the Jets", the duo started singing [...] "Artpop". They were seated opposite {{to each other on}} piano, and Gaga was ornamented in a dress made of Coca-Cola cans. During the chorus, they were joined by The Muppets who aided with background vocals. Chris Willman from Billboard called John as the best guest performer of the special. Maricela Gonzales from Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the performance, saying that although she did not understand the message behind the song, [...] "hat is clear is that Gaga and Elton John belong together. I'm serious, I want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> show." ...|$|E

500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels they have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn {{was a hero}} to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try {{to inform the public}} about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he {{was a bit of a}} hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
500|$|Yet, Cornell and White {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{on opposite sides}} of a battle that would in the end lead to the creation of Cornell University. In 1863, the legislature had granted the proceeds of the land grant to the People's College in Havana (now Montour Falls), with conditions that would need to be met within a certain time frame. Because the Morrill Act set a five-year limit on each state identifying a land grant college, and it seemed unlikely that the People's College would meet its conditions, the legislature was ready to select a different school. [...] Initially, Cornell, {{as a member of the}} Board of Trustees of the New York State Agricultural College at Ovid, wanted half the grant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> school. [...] However, White [...] "vigorously opposed this bill, on the ground that the educational resources of the state were already too much dispersed". He felt that the grant would be most effective if it were used to establish or strengthen a comprehensive university.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place {{to get to this}} one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|J. Cole {{announced}} a release date of January 28, 2013, (his birthday) {{along with the}} album name on November 9, 2012. In early January the album was included on multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] such as MTV and XXL ranked Born Sinner the sixth most anticipated album of 2013. After describing the January release date as ambitious, he would announce on New Years Day 2013 that the album would be coming out at a later date. On February 22, 2013, J. Cole said that the album should arrive around June 2013. He later would confirm a release month for June, and then on April 8, 2013, J. Cole announced via Twitter that the album would be released on June 25, 2013. Interesting enough, that date {{would have been the}} seventeenth year anniversary of the release of Jay-Z's debut album Reasonable Doubt. However, he announced on May 20, 2013, via his Twitter account that he would move the release up one week to June 18, 2013. He later revealed that he moved up the release date to coincide with the release of Kanye West's album Yeezus, saying [...] "Instantly the lightbulb … it got real. I was like, 'Yo…' The idea hit me instantly: 'You got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> date. I'm not going to sit … I worked too hard to come a week later after Kanye West drops an amazing album. It'd be like, 'Oh and J. Cole dropped too, a week later.' Nah. I'm going to go see him on that date. He's the greatest. So it's like, I'm a competitor by nature so it was instant, it wasn't even a thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Walcott {{got back}} to Liston {{and looked at the}} {{knockdown}} timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. [...] "The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, 'I counted him out—the fight is over,'" [...] Walcott said after the fight. [...] "Nat Fleischer [...] was sitting beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over." [...] Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. [...] Strict interpretation of the knockdown/count rule states it is the referee's count and not the timekeeper's that is the official count. [...] Furthermore, that count cannot be started until the fighter scoring the knockdown goes to and remains in a neutral corner. [...] Ali did neither. [...] Walcott never began a count in the ring because of Ali's non-compliance and his physical struggle with getting Ali <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> neutral corner. [...] The interference of ringside reporters regarding interpretation of the rules, the fight stoppage and the controversy after the fight had not been seen since the Long Count Fight between Champion Gene Tunney and challenger Jack Dempsey in 1927.|$|E
