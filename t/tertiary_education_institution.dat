5|$|Bruxner detested the UAP Deputy Leader and Minister for Public Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner, whom Bruxner saw {{as trying}} to {{undermine}} confidence in Steven's leadership and reducing Country Party influence in the government. When Stevens went {{on a visit to}} London in March 1936 for six months until October, Bruxner became Acting Premier, with Spooner as Acting Deputy. The animosity between the two became most pronounced at this time, often over the most petty issues. In May 1937, Bruxner visited the United Kingdom {{as a member of the}} NSW parliamentary delegation to the coronation of King George VI. At the March 1938 election, the Stevens-Bruxner government retained power against Lang and the still-divided Labor Party. Bruxner was re-elected with 61% of the vote. Bruxner worked with his long-time friend, now Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish a regional <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institution.</b> After the 1938 election, they moved to establish the New England University College, a constituent college of the University of Sydney in the city of Armidale, and Bruxner was appointed to the first Advisory Council, on which he served until 1951.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the various challenges that confront <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> {{and economic development}} in Africa. It discusses the link between human capital development and <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> {{and its impact on}} economic development in Africa. The paper argues that human capital development through <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> is indispensable among African states for accelerated development in terms of poverty reduction, high productivity, life expectancy and increased literacy rate among others. The paper notes that the development of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> in Africa has been neglected by African states because of its capital intensiveness. The World Bank and other International Organizations that assist Africa in the development of education encouraged this neglect by laying emphasis on the development of primary and secondary education. The paper argues that the challenges of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> vis-à-vis economic development in African include the dependency type of relationship between African states and their former colonial masters and/or industrial countries, inadequate financing, lack of university autonomy, poor management of resources resulting from weak leadership, faculty shortage, among others. Finally, the paper recommends, among others that adequate funding of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> in Africa is sine qua non if African states have to pull itself out from under development...|$|R

25|$|Despite this, the Franklins {{did much}} to reform Hobart Town society and the colony of Van Diemen's Land in general. Lady Jane Franklin ordered built a replica Greek Temple, {{modelled}} on the Parthenon and designed by James Blackburn in the bush in Lenah Valley, which opened in 1841. Inside the temple, she housed the Lady Jane Franklin Museum, resplendent with replicas of the Elgin Marbles. The Franklins inaugurated the Royal Hobart Regatta in 1838. This popular event has been held annually since, and features sailing, rowing, swimming, and other water-sports events, culminating in a fireworks display. They also founded Christ College, {{now part of the}} University of Tasmania, the first <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>institution</b> in the city. Lady Jane attempted to establish evening gatherings to discuss art, literature and science, but these proved unpopular with well-to-do 'Hobartians', who preferred that she host parties and dances instead.|$|E
