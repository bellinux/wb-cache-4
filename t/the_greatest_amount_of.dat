5|$|The {{third stage}} of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify {{airframe}} damage. HUG Phase 3.1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> structural damage were replaced in HUG Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but {{the scope of this}} phase of the program was reduced after {{it was found that the}} number of man-hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an L-3 Communications facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.|$|E

25|$|However, , {{there was}} still a {{significant}} amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.|$|E

25|$|In 1665, Louis XIV sent a French garrison, the Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment, to Quebec. The {{government}} of the colony was reformed {{along the lines of}} the {{government of}} France, with the Governor General and Intendant subordinate to the Minister of the Marine in France. In 1665, Jean Talon was sent by Minister of the Marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert to New France as the first Intendant.

25|$|The passerines display <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{diversity}} {{with over}} 33 families within New Guinea. The passerines of New Guinea are mostly small, often colourful birds which mostly inhabit the forested regions. The best-known family in New Guinea is the Paradisaeidae, {{one of three}} families there known collectively as birds of paradise. Many species show extravagant sexual dimorphism. The males can be ornamented with bright, iridescent colours, and modified, ornamental feathers such as tufts and wattles. They also display mating rituals, in which they undergo elaborate movements and calling, to attract females. Some species do not show sexual dimorphism; {{both male and female}} can have or lack ornamentation.|$|E
25|$|Post-accident {{analysis}} {{concluded that}} the final control method (i.e., dissipation of the prompt critical state) occurred by means of catastrophic core disassembly: destructive melting, vaporization, and consequent conventional explosive expansion of {{the parts of the}} reactor core where <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> heat was being produced most quickly. It was estimated that this core heating and vaporization process happened in about 7.5 milliseconds, before enough steam had been formed to shut down the reaction, beating the steam shutdown by a few milliseconds. A key statistic makes it clear why the core blew apart: the reactor designed for a 3 MW power output operated momentarily at a peak of nearly 20 GW, a power density over 6,000 times higher than its safe operating limit.|$|E

25|$|Chemotaxis {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
25|$|The city of Kaifeng grew to {{be a major}} hub, later {{becoming}} the capital of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Although the Tang and Song dynasty international seaports‚Äîthe greatest being Guangzhou and Quanzhou, respectively‚Äîand maritime foreign trade brought merchants great fortune, it was the Grand Canal within China that spurred <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> economic activity and commercial profit. During the Song and earlier periods, barge ships occasionally crashed and wrecked along the Shanyang Yundao section of the Grand Canal while passing the double slipways, and more often than not those were then robbed of the tax grain by local bandits. This prompted Qiao Weiyue, an Assistant Commissioner of Transport for Huainan, to invent a double-gate system known as the pound lock in the year 984. This allowed ships to wait within a gated space while the water could be drained to appropriate levels; the Chinese also built roofed hangars over the space to add further protection for the ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{presenting}} multiple stimuli types such as chemical, physical, and biological cues on neural progenitor cell differentiation {{has not been}} explored. A {{study was conducted in}} which three different stimuli were presented to adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs): postnatal rat type-1 astrocytes (biological), laminin (chemical), and micropatterned substrate (physical). Over 75% of the AHPCs aligned within 20¬∞ of the grooves compared to random growth on the non-patterned substrates. When AHPCs were grown on micropatterned substrates with astrocytes, outgrowth was influenced by the astrocytes that had aligned with the grooves; namely, the AHPCs extended processes along the astrocytic cytoskeletal filaments. However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, the cells were stained with antibodies for class III Œ≤-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> differentiation was seen with AHPCs cultured on patterned substrates with astrocytes.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{soil erosion}} and {{landslides}} in its upper catchment {{have produced a}} silt yield of about 19m3/ha/year (10cuyd/acre/yr), {{one of the highest}} in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> coarse silt in proportion to its total sediment load. The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the sediment load settles {{out of the water and}} is deposited on an immense alluvial fan that has grown to an area of about 15000km2. This fan extends some 180km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels that shift laterally over the fan from time to time. Without channelisation, floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24200m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24km wide, flowing at one metre per second.|$|E
