2500|$|If in English a {{relative}} pronoun {{would be the}} object of {{a relative}} clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: the things of me to have seen = [...] "the things that I saw"; Here is theirs to have seen = <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw".|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{a special}} type of [...] known as [...] "the al- for ”. The noun on which the al- is prefixed, in this case, is never {{explicitly}} mentioned but the listener knows what is being referred to. For example, the word [...] al-kitāb (the book) may actually refer to the classical book of Arabic grammar written by Sibawayh. Whenever grammarians talk about [...] "the book", <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean and it is always understood without explanation.|$|E

2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the salad bowl at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video.

2500|$|And {{although}} he admitted the relative and conventional character {{of space and}} time, {{he believed that the}} classical convention is more [...] "convenient" [...] and continued to distinguish between [...] "true" [...] time in the ether and [...] "apparent" [...] time in moving systems. Addressing the question if a new convention of space and time is needed he wrote in 1912: [...] "Shall we be obliged to modify our conclusions? Certainly not; we had adopted a convention because it seemed convenient and we had said that nothing could constrain us to abandon it. Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all. And those who are not of this opinion can legitimately retain the old one in order not to disturb their old habits, I believe, just between us, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> shall do {{for a long time to}} come." ...|$|E

Brian Dunlap explained the emphasis of the new site, [...] "The guys are straight. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do when the cameras aren’t on, {{so we wanted to}} give surfers a glimpse into that part of who the guys are." [...] The site was created to serve as a complement to Corbin Fisher's site AmateurCollegeMen.com, and Dunlap commented on the business potential of the two sites for webmasters, [...] "Maybe a big portion of their traffic has already signed up to Corbin Fisher. Well, now they can start earning new money off those old surfers. This is an opportunity to promote not just one site, but two. There’s an opportunity to earn two commissions off one referral." [...] By August 2007, AmateurCollegeMen.com had about 500 [...] "solo and hardcore all-male videos". In August 2008 Corbin Fisher described itself as a website offering media of amateur sex between attractive young people at universities. The website explained that most of the models on the site were heterosexual young men.|$|E

[...] But Rabbi Nehemiah explained {{that it was because}} “they are one people, and they have all one language,” that they rebelled against God. [...] Rabbi Abba bar Kahana taught that God gave them an opportunity to repent, for the words “and now” in [...] indicate repentance, for [...] says, “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God.” But the next word of [...] “No,” reports their response. [...] The continuation of [...] then reports God’s reply, “Then let all that they purpose to do be withheld from them!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Few white South Carolinians {{considered}} {{abolition of}} slavery as an option. Having lived {{as a minority}} among the majority-black slaves, they feared that, if freed, the slaves would try to [...] "Africanize" [...] the whites' cherished society and culture. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believed had happened after slave revolutions in Haiti, in which numerous whites and free people of color were killed during the revolution. South Carolina's white politicians were divided between devoted Unionists who opposed any sort of secession, and those who believed secession was a state's right.|$|R

What naval powers the country still had could only hope to prevent British warships from attacking Norwegian trading vessels, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> attempted to do. The coastal trade was {{extremely important to}} prevent starvation - fish from northern Norway were traded for grain from areas south of Norway, especially Denmark. Naval forces of small gunboats were placed at strategic positions along the coast, with the naval commander in chief ordering each one out as and when enemy activity was reported in their operating area.|$|R
2500|$|Most importantly, Egyptian {{education}} faces a main challenge {{because of}} the quality of teachers that teach in public schools. An ethnography study conducted by Sarah Hartmann in 2008 concluded that most teachers in Egypt resort to teaching for lack of better options and because the nature of the job does not conflict with their more important gender role as mothers. The low salaries offered by the public schooling system in Egypt attracts low-skilled employees. A study conducted in 1989 documenting the bureaucracy of the Egyptian Ministry of Education concluded that teachers' annual salary in Egypt is, on average, $360. A later study conducted in 2011 showed that teachers earn an average annual salary of $460 which is less than half the country's average annual per-capita income. Following the low quality of teachers in Egypt, they lack basic psychological background {{that would allow them to}} deal with students. Corporal punishment is a common practice in Egyptian schools even though it has not been deeply discussed in literature. A recent example was brought to media's attention in 2011 when a pre-K teacher [...] was caught on video consistently beating his students harshly The teacher was sent to court but the parents and students protested for questioning him expressing that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe to be the best way to deal with their youngsters.|$|E
2500|$|On December 28, the day {{the game}} was shipped to stores, Bungie's head-office was {{contacted}} by their Japanese publisher, who informed them a woman working on the Asian translation of the game had discovered a major bug in the Windows version. She had installed {{the game in the}} root directory of her hard drive, and then used the uninstall program to uninstall it. The game was successfully uninstalled, but much of the contents of her hard drive were also erased. Jason Jones attempted to replicate the problem, quickly discovering what was wrong, and figuring out how to correct the faulty code. However, roughly 200,000 copies of the game were already in transit to major retail stores across North America. Jones, Alex Seropian, Doug Zartman, Diane Donohue, and David Joost (sales and marketing director) quickly convened a meeting to decide what to do. The team essentially had two choices. On the one hand, they could say nothing, and quietly fix the bug in a patch that would be immediately made available for download on their website. In favor of this course of action, it was argued that installing a game to the root directory of a hard drive was an unusual thing to do, something there was little chance of anyone repeating, and so it was unlikely anyone would ever encounter the bug. The other option was to publicly announce the problem and recall the game. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did. According to Jones, ...|$|E
