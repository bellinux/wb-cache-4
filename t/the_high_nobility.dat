25|$|The most {{outstanding}} exponent of the Catholic renewal was Péter Pázmány, archbishop of Esztergom (16161637). He wrote influential polemical tracts {{characterized by the}} robust freshness of his style {{that contributed to the}} standardization of the Hungarian language. He founded a university at Nagyszombat in 1635 from which Jesuit missionaries could carry on their activities throughout Royal Hungary. The archbishop and the Jesuits managed to persuade more and more members of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> among them members of the Zrinyi, Batthyány, and Wesselényi families to join Catholicism. The example of the magnates was followed by numerous other noblemen, thus at the Diet of 1638 the majority of the deputies representing the counties was already Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The Low Countries have a {{particular}} history of religious conflict with roots in the Calvinist reformation movement of the 1530s. These conflicts {{became known as the}} Dutch Revolt or the Eighty Years' War. By dynastic inheritance the whole of the Netherlands (the modern day Netherlands and Belgium) had come to be ruled by the kings of Spain. Following aggressive Calvinist preaching in and around the rich merchant cities of the southern Netherlands, organized anti-catholic religious protests grew in violence and frequency. In 1566, a league of about 400 members of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> themselves disgruntled at Spanish rule, presented a petition to the governor Margaret of Parma to suspend punitive actions against the Calvinists.|$|E
25|$|The merchants of Lisbon allied {{themselves}} with the lower and the middle Portuguese nobility and entreated the Duke of Braganza to accept the throne. According to some historians he was really as indifferent as he seemed {{and it was the}} ambition of his wife and of his allies that made him king. Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, like the rest of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> benefited by Madrid's rule, but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded him. In any event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (João IV).|$|E

25|$|In 1360 {{the kingdom}} of Galicia was again at the centre of a {{succession}} crisis, this time of European dimension. The throne of Castile was disputed between King King Peter I and his half-brother, Henry Count of Trastámara, within the broader context of the Hundred Years' War. This fratricidal conflict lasted between 1354 and 1369, having its origin in the policies of Peter I, who tried to expand his royal power while leaning on the councils of cities and municipalities; this would {{come at the expense}} of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> including Castilian families such as Pimentel, Ponce de León, Mendoza, Fernández de Córdoba, and Alvarez de Toledo; and Galician ones as Castro. As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy, although this coalition was soon discontinued.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, {{a type of}} porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost {{ubiquitous}} potherbs and parsley {{was used as a}} leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Bagrat became king, the Bagratids’ drive to {{complete}} the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at Kutaisi in western Georgia from which they ran all {{of what had been}} the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia/Kartli; Tao/Tayk had been lost to the Byzantines while a Muslim emir remained in Tbilisi and the kings of Kakheti obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat’s minority, the regency had advanced the positions of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> whose influence he subsequently tried to limit when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the resurgent Seljuq Turks. Although the Byzantine Empire and Georgia had centuries-long cultural and religious ties, and the Seljuqs posed a substantial threat to the empire itself, Constantinople’s aggressiveness on the Caucasian political scene contributed to an atmosphere of distrust and recrimination, and prevented the two Christian nations from effective cooperation against the common threat. With assertion of the Georgian Bagratid hegemony in the Caucasus being the cornerstone of Bagrat’s reign, his policy can be understood as the attempt to play the Seljuqs and Byzantines off against one another.|$|E

[...] In contrast to noble arms, burgher arms are allowed only a shield with one tilting or closed helmet without a necklace or coronet. A wreath and crest must be placed on the helmet, and a motto or war cry can be used. Unlike noble arms, few burgher arms were handed down through the generations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to examine whether the second war of {{independence}} from 1332 - 41 was a ‘national’ war or simply a series of regional conflicts. Three separate but overlapping influences are examined: national identity, {{the extent to which}} the different regions of Scotland were drawn in, and the landed interests involved in each region. These three issues are considered for the first time using a prosophographical approach, examining the background and actions of the key players in <b>the</b> conflict, <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland. <b>The</b> thesis examines, first of all, the role of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland in the 1330 s. It then looks at each of the recognisable regions of the country in turn, considering who the key members of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> were in each region, what their interests were and to what extent they were involved in the region. Finally it looks at the motivations of these individuals, primarily from the perspective of national identity, or perhaps more accurately, regnal solidarity. Its conclusion is that the second war of independence was indeed a national war, centred as it was on the interests of the kingdom as a national entity but that other factors – the legitimacy of the Bruce and Balliol claims, the influence of family allegiances through marriage, the personal safety of the members of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility,</b> <b>the</b> threat of forfeiture and their personal ambitions - were also at work...|$|R
