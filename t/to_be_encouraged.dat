Retired participants who regularly took art classes were interviewed about their previous art class participation.

In professional cricket the captain often has some say in who will form the squad from which teams are selected, and may also decide how young up-and-coming players are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> and improved, and how members of the squad who are not regularly selected for first-team matches are to gain match practice.|$|E

In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer.

25|$|A lobster-pot trap is {{a chamber}} that {{is easy to}} enter, and whose exit is either {{difficult}} to find or obstructed by inward-pointing bristles. Lobster pots are the trapping mechanism in Genlisea, the corkscrew plants. These plants appear to specialise in aquatic protozoa. A Y-shaped modified leaf allows prey to enter but not exit. Inward-pointing hairs force the prey to move in a particular direction. Prey entering the spiral entrance that coils around the upper two arms of the Y are forced to move inexorably towards a stomach in the lower arm of the Y, where they are digested. Prey movement is also thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> by water movement through the trap, produced {{in a similar way}} to the vacuum in bladder traps, and probably evolutionarily related to it.|$|E
25|$|Select The Preferred Policy – The authors {{suggest that}} the overall best biofuel comes from the {{sugarcane}} in Brazil after comparing the economic & the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO2 emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged,</b> exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in {{the volume of the}} business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.|$|E
25|$|The Zohar, one of {{the primary}} sources of Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism), {{attributes}} holiness to the beard, and strongly discourages its removal, declaring that even the shortening of a beard by scissors is a great sin; it was even said that Isaac Luria, a significant figure in the history of Kabbalistic mysticism, meticulously avoided touching his beard, lest he should accidentally cause hairs to drop from it. Kabbalistic teachings gradually spread into Slavonic regions, and consequently beard trimming was discouraged in these areas, even if it involved scissors; it was the Hasidic Jews who more closely followed Kabbalistic practices than Jews of a Lithuanian or Misnagdish background, and thus it became the Hasidic Jews who are known for the distinctive traditional practice of growing their beards. However, in Italy, shaving the beard was so popular that even the Italian followers of Kabbalah did it; an Italian Kabbalist even went to the extent of arguing that beard shaving was only prohibited in Canaan, and was actually <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> elsewhere.|$|E

She used the island's unique feudal system to draw tourists, and refused to allow anything to deter them by ruining its peacefulness. She thus banned motor vehicles and holiday camps, but the Chief Pleas refused to pass an ordinance that would forbid selling alcohol to anyone known to get drunk. Like her eldest son Francis, heir apparent to the seigneurship, she was fascinated by film production. While Appointment with Venus was being shot on Sark in 1951, the Dame even deigned to allow a car ashore, ostensibly believing that [...] "a Land Rover {{was some sort of}} senior Boy Scout".|$|E

500|$|Diarmaid Ferriter {{selected}} {{the book as}} his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature [...] "Authors' choices". Ferriter commented: [...] "Rogan has to be admired for his perseverance and determination {{when it comes to}} chronicling {{the life and times of}} contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey. Well-researched biography is always <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged,</b> particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character". David Sinclair, author of Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam, reviewed the book for The Guardian, and commented: [...] "Rogan's scrutiny of Morrison's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer's life story, and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering. Rogan's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer." [...] Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison's mannerisms, and concluded his review with: [...] "But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison's legal representatives have had a chance to get out their fine-tooth combs." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong {{received}} a monthly salary of nearly S$96,000 (about $1.15 million a year), while other ministers earned about $48,900 a month ($586,800 a year). This made them {{among the highest}} paid government ministers in the world. In October that year, the Government issued a white paper entitled Competitive Salaries for Competent & Honest Government which proposed that the salaries of ministers and civil servants be pegged at two-thirds the average principal earned income of the top four earners in six professions: accounting, banking, engineering, law, local manufacturing firms and multinational corporations. These professions were chosen because their top members had general management skills which ministers also had to have. According to the white paper, the one-third [...] "discount" [...] would be [...] "a visible demonstration of the sacrifice involved in becoming a minister". Although [...] "alaries should never be the motivation for persons to become ministers", the financial sacrifice had to be minimized if outstanding and committed Singaporeans were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> {{to take on the}} [...] "risks and public responsibilities of a political career". The benchmark would also be used to determine the pay of the President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public Service Commission and judges.|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a response from}} practising Muslim Afroze Zaidi-Jivraj, a graduate in English who had recently begun a masters degree student in theology at the University of Birmingham. She remarked that Holland's methodology was flawed because he had neglected to study the corpus of material on early Islamic history found in libraries across the Islamic world, instead using only sources he had obtained in Western libraries. She argued {{that he did not}} consult a single Islamic scholar of Islamic history, instead choosing the more [...] "exotic" [...] option of interviewing a Bedouin, and that although he had consulted Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr– [...] "a token Muslim voice"– Nasr was a scholar of Islamic philosophy and not Islamic history. Asserting that Islam: The Untold Story was based on poor scholarship by assuming the superiority of secular Western historical inquiry over Islamic historical traditions, she argued that it would promote negative views of [...] "an already poorly-understood faith and its much-maligned adherents." [...] Abdullah al-Andalusi of the Muslim Debate Initiative sums Islam: the Untold Story as [...] "a missed opportunity to transcend an outdated Besserwissen approach to comparative religion, and to establish an inter-faith dialogue based on insightful mutual understanding and acceptance of who we are today. While informed revisionist readings of the history of all faiths, Islam included, is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged,</b> Tom Holland’s TV show, an anti-Islamic polemic dressed up as history, does not do what it says on the tin.
