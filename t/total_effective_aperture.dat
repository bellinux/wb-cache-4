40|$|Methods to {{increase}} the amount of data that can be received from outer planet missions are described with emphasis on antenna arraying systems designed {{to increase}} the <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> <b>aperture</b> of the receiving system. One such method is virtual center arraying (VCA). In VCA, a combined carrier reference is derived at a point that is, conceptually, the geometric center of the array. This point need not coincide with any of the actual antennas of the array. A noise analysis of the VCA system is given along with formulas for the phase jitter as a function of loop bandwidths and the amount of loop damping. If the ratio of the loop bandwidths of the center loop to the vertex loops is greater than 100, then the jitter is very nearly equal to that expected for ideal combined carrier referencing...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we derive {{upper and}} lower bounds as well as a simple closed-form {{approximation}} for the capacity of the continuous-time, bandlimited, additive white Gaussian noise channel in a three-dimensional free-space electromagnetic propagation environment subject to constraints on the <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> antenna <b>aperture</b> area of the link and a total transmitter power constraint. We assume that the communication range is much larger than the radius of the sphere containing the antennas {{at both ends of the}} link, and we show that, in general, the capacity can only be achieved by transmitting multiple spatially-multiplexed data streams simultaneously over the channel. Furthermore, the lower bound on capacity can be approached asymptotically by transmitting the data streams between a pair of physically-realizable distributed antenna arrays at either end of the link. A consequence of this result is that, in general, communication at close to the maximum achievable data rate on a deep-space communication link can be achieved in practice if and only if the communication system utilizes spatial multiplexing over a distributed MIMO antenna array. Such an approach to deep-space communication does not appear to be envisioned currently by any of the international space agencies or any commercial space companies. A second consequence is that the capacity of a long-range free-space communication link, if properly utilized, grows asymptotically as a function of the square root of the received SNR rather than only logarithmically in the received SNR...|$|R

40|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the amount of data that can be received from outer planet missions by coherently combining signals from ground antennas in such a way as {{to increase}} the <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> <b>aperture</b> of the receiving system are discussed. As these signals become weaker, the baseband arraying technique in current use degrades somewhat due to carrier jitter. One solution to this problem is Sideband-Aided Receiver Arraying (SARA). In SARA, sidebands demodulated to baseband in a master receiver at the largest antenna are used to allow slave receivers in the other antennas to track the sideband power in the signal rather than the carrier power. The already existing receivers can be used in the slaves to track and demodulate the signals in either a residual carrier or a suppressed carrier environment. The resultant baseband signals from all the antennas can then be combined using existing baseband combining equiment. Computer simulations of SARA show increases in throughput (measured in data bits per second) over baseband-only combining 17 percent at Voyager 2 Uranum encounter and 31 percent at Neptune for a four-element antenna array and (7, 1 / 2) convolutional coding...|$|E
30|$|We also {{calculated}} the transmitted {{power of a}} horizontal nanoslit and a slanted nanoslit formed in a 150 -nm-thick film with {{the same amount of}} aperture opening (slit width of 60  nm). At 633  nm wavelength, the total transmitted power of the slanted nanoslit is found to be ~[*] 45 % of the horizontal nanoslit’s. This difference is partly ascribed to a smaller effective-aperture-area of a slanted nanoslit seen by an incident beam. The transmission efficiency of the horizontal nanoslit is estimated to be 120 %. Here the transmission efficiency is defined as the ratio of total transmitted power to the incident power that falls on the aperture area, that is, the throughput power is normalized by the aperture area seen from the incident beam direction. It {{is interesting to note that}} the transmission efficiency is greater than 100 %. This implies the nanoslit transmission involves a funneling effect occurring at aperture edges on the incident side [34]. In the case of the 8 slanted nanoslit array lens (Fig.  3 a), the transmission efficiency is estimated to be 4.8 %. In this estimation, the total transmitted power is normalized by the input power that falls on the entire slit array, that is, 5.6  µm wide area. Considering the relatively large spacing between nanoslits, the reduction of overall transmission is explained by the fact that the <b>total,</b> <b>effective</b> <b>aperture</b> areas of 8 slits account for a small portion of the total lens area.|$|E
