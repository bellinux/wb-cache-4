5|$|The south coast was {{vulnerable}} to Danish Viking invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries. In 787, it was assaulted and conquered by Danish pirates, and then {{during the reign}} of Æthelwulf, King of Wessex in 838, a Danish fleet landed between Portsmouth and Southampton and the surrounding area was plundered. In response, Æthelwulf sent Wulfherd and the governor of Dorsetshire to confront <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> at Portsmouth, where most of their ships were docked. They were successful although Wulfherd was killed. In 1001, <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> returned and pillaged Portsmouth and surrounding locations, threatening the English with extinction. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> were massacred by the survivors the following year and rebuilding began, although the town suffered further attacks until 1066.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time {{resistance}} flared up again in western Mercia, where the forces of Eadric the Wild, together with his Welsh allies and further rebel forces from Cheshire and Shropshire, attacked the castle at Shrewsbury. In the south-west, rebels from Devon and Cornwall attacked the Norman garrison at Exeter, but were repulsed by the defenders and scattered by a Norman relief force under Count Brian. Other rebels from Dorset, Somerset and neighbouring areas besieged Montacute Castle but were defeated by a Norman army gathered from London, Winchester and Salisbury under Geoffrey of Coutances. Meanwhile, William attacked <b>the</b> <b>Danes,</b> who had moored for the winter south of the Humber in Lincolnshire, and drove {{them back to the}} north bank. Leaving Robert of Mortain in charge of Lincolnshire, he turned west and defeated the Mercian rebels in battle at Stafford. When <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> attempted to return to Lincolnshire, the Norman forces there again drove them back across the Humber. William advanced into Northumbria, defeating an attempt to block his crossing of the swollen River Aire at Pontefract. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> fled at his approach, and he occupied York. He bought off <b>the</b> <b>Danes,</b> who agreed to leave England in the spring, and during the winter of 1069–70 his forces systematically devastated Northumbria in the Harrying of the North, subduing all resistance. As a symbol of his renewed authority over the north, William ceremonially wore his crown at York on Christmas Day 1069.|$|E
5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by <b>the</b> <b>Danes.</b> In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E
5|$|In 1011 <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> again raided England, {{and from}} 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of Ælfmaer, whose life Ælfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city. Ælfheah was taken {{prisoner}} and held captive for seven months. Godwine (Bishop of Rochester), Leofrun (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's reeve, Ælfweard were captured also, but the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, Ælfmær, managed to escape. Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> following Ælfheah's capture.|$|E

5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: {{if he tried to}} sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> were soon fully aware of the details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E

6000|$|Monday, September 17th, I {{had a long}} {{conversation}} with the Swede, who spoke with the most poignant contempt of <b>the</b> <b>Dane,</b> whom he described as a fool, purse-mad; but he confirmed the boasts of <b>the</b> <b>Dane</b> respecting <b>the</b> largeness of his fortune, which he had acquired {{in the first instance}} as an advocate, and afterwards as a planter. From <b>the</b> <b>Dane</b> and from himself I collected that he was indeed a Swedish nobleman, who had squandered a fortune, that was never very large, and had made over his property to <b>the</b> <b>Dane,</b> on whom he was now utterly dependent. He seemed to suffer very little pain from <b>the</b> <b>Dane's</b> insolence. He was in a high degree humane and attentive to the English lady, who suffered most fearfully, and for whom he performed many little offices with a tenderness and delicacy which seemed to prove real goodness of heart. Indeed his general manners and conversation were not only pleasing, but even interesting; and I struggled to believe his insensibility respecting <b>the</b> <b>Dane</b> philosophical fortitude. For though <b>the</b> <b>Dane</b> was now quite sober, his character oozed out of him at every pore. And after dinner, when he was again flushed with wine, every quarter of an hour or perhaps oftener he would shout out to the Swede, [...] "Ho! Nobility, go--do such a thing! Mr. Nobility!--tell the gentlemen such a story, and so forth;" [...] with an insolence which must have excited disgust and detestation, if his vulgar rants on the sacred rights of equality, joined to his wild havoc of general grammar no less than of the English language, had not rendered it so irresistibly laughable.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, the two squadrons {{encountered}} each other off the island of Heligoland, then controlled by neutral Great Britain. Tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while the slower Prussian vessels lagged behind, unable to effectively engage the Danish warships. Tegetthoff's flagship, Schwarzenberg, bore {{the brunt of the}} Danish gunfire and caught fire three times, the last of which could not be put out quickly and forced Tegetthoff to seek shelter in the neutral waters around Heligoland. Though Denmark claimed a tactical victory in the battle, <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> were forced to end the blockade of the German coast. An armistice came into effect three days after the Battle of Heligoland. By the time fighting broke out again in June, further Austrian warships had arrived to strengthen the Austro-Prussian naval forces, and <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> did not seek to challenge them.|$|E
5|$|Records {{become more}} certain by the tenth century. Violence was endemic in medieval Europe, not {{excepting}} Wales. During the tenth and eleventh centuries {{the coasts of}} Wales were frequently raided by the Vikings. In 987/988 the clas was destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>Danes,</b> but the worst to suffer was St David's, with attacks in 1073, 1080 and 1091. In 989 Maredudd ab Owain raised a poll tax to bribe <b>the</b> <b>Danes</b> {{to stay away from}} Llanbadarn (a tribute was levied of one penny for every man within his dominions, which, in Welsh, was called Glwmaen, or the tribute of the black army). However, in 1038 the church was reduced to ashes by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who wrested it from the hands of prince Hywel ab Edwin, whilst subjugating Ceredigion. The lands were ravaged and the area depopulated, though the clas survived. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn seems to have held the area until his death in 1063.|$|E
5|$|The East Anglian Danes joined Æthelwold in {{a raid on}} Mercia, {{reaching}} {{as far as the}} fortified burh at Cricklade on {{the border}} with Wessex. He then crossed the Thames into Wessex itself to raid Braydon. Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia, but he withdrew without engaging Æthelwold in battle. The men of Kent lingered, although according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Edward sent seven messengers to recall them. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> caught up with the men of Kent to fight the Battle of the Holme. Its location is unknown but may be Holme in Cambridgeshire. <b>The</b> <b>Danes</b> were victorious but suffered heavy losses. Æthelwold was among the leaders on the Danish side who were killed, together with Eohric, the Viking King of East Anglia, two holds (Danish noblemen), Ysopa and Oscetel, and Beorhtsige, son of the ætheling Beornoth, who was probably a kinsman of the former king of Mercia, Burgred. Kentish losses included their two ealdormen, Sigewulf and Sigehelm, and an Abbot Cenwulf.|$|E
