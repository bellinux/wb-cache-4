5|$|The pre-show {{match was}} a fatal-four-way {{elimination}} tag team {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso), RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando), accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Cesaro), accompanied by Zeb Colter. The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway. Five minutes into the match, Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature Neutralizer to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven-minute mark. Later, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock. Colter demanded that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> differences aside, but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E

25|$|Tamzara is an Armenian, Assyrian, Azerbaijani and Greek folk dance {{native to}} Anatolia. There are many {{versions}} of Tamzara, with slightly different music and steps, {{coming from the}} various regions and old villages in Anatolia. Firstly they step three steps ahead and strike their left {{feet on the ground}} and then <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> left feet ahead and for a while stand on it, then they make three little steps back and speed their actions a bit more in the second part with the actions of the first part. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked pinkies.|$|E

They {{do this in a}} walking motion. it is very hard especially if you have to follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} women’s {{education}} {{to be as}} equal as the men’s in Ivory Coast, the government must provide more schools for free, so that the people don’t think about financial issues once <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> child at school, and so the parents can afford to put both {{their sons and daughters}} in school. Education is free in Ivory Coast, but the parents must provide the school supplies, which might be a challenge if they have more than one child (Our Africa). This might lessen the need for women to go to school. For this to happen, the people must inform the government and if they refuse, protest. Education is a basic right everyone should afford, no matter the gender.|$|E
25|$|A further major {{component}} of the armed resistance consisted of individuals and groups motivated by anti-communist convictions and persuaded that only an armed engagement could contain increasing terror and prevent an irrevocable communist takeover. Some of the resistance groups were led by ex-army officers and acted in a more coordinated and planned way. It appears that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> hope in stirring up a more general armed insurrection, which never came to life. A smaller category of insurgents were Romanian refugees recruited in Europe by the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), trained in France, Italy and Greece and then dropped in the Carpathians. It seems, however, that most of them, {{not being able to}} create local contacts imperative for survival, were soon captured.|$|E

500|$|Over 7,548 unique {{characters}} {{participated in}} the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted {{in the loss of}} 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Onlines history, estimating that the battle cost $300,000–$330,000 in real-world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While direct conversion of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for $20 USD, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not mean this amount of real-world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Onlines economy, stated that [...] "To me, as an economist, that doesn’t really matter. In both cases this is economical value that is created by people’s work, either in real life or in virtual life. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> blood, sweat and tears into making stuff so they can have an advantage in a battle, because in this battle like in any other battle in meat worlds, in real life, it is the resources you have available." ...|$|E

2500|$|A gold {{miniature}} charm {{depicting a}} pair of football pants is given to all players and coaches following a victory over the Michigan Wolverines.

[...] The first gold pants, which were a creation of Simon Lazarus (president of the Lazarus chain of department stores) and Herbert Levy, were awarded that year for a 34–0 defeat of the Wolverines.|$|E
2500|$|In the process, {{they adopted}} {{most of the}} Toltec/Nahua (code) pantheon, but they also made {{significant}} changes in their religion. As the Mexica rose in power, they adopted the Nahua gods at equal status to their own. For instance, Tlaloc was the rain god of all the Nahuatl-speaking peoples. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>their</b> local god Huitzilopochtli {{at the same level}} as the ancient Nahua god, and also replaced the Nahua Sun god with their own. Thus, Tlaloc/Huitzilopochtli represents the duality of water and fire, as evidenced by the twin pyramids uncovered near the Zocalo in Mexico City in the late 1970s, and it reminds us of the warrior ideals of the Aztec: the Aztec glyph of war is [...] "burning water".|$|E
