The palace guards will not honor her petulant orders to fetch Jochanaan for her, so she teasingly works on Narraboth to bring Jochanaan before her. Despite the orders he has {{received}} from Herod, Narraboth finally gives in after she promises <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{performed}} [...] "All Around the World" [...] at the Capital FM Summertime Ball 2012. For the performance, he sported fingerless gloves, a Union Jack {{tank with}} matching vest, and jeans. The singer also performed the track during a promotional concert in Europe on June 4, 2012, along with [...] "Boyfriend" [...] and [...] "Die in Your Arms". Bieber also performed [...] "All Around the World" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend" [...] at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards on June 17. The song {{is also used}} as Bieber's 2012–13 Believe Tour's opening song. Entering from the upper portion of the arena, Bieber was lowered onto {{the center of the}} stage wearing a massive pair of charcoal-colored wings. He was quickly joined by a troupe of male backing dancers as the song was played. Fireworks exploded, laser lights shot wildly from the ceiling, confetti fell to the floor and plumes of smoke were released {{from the bottom of the}} stage. Sophie A. Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review for the performance and wrote that [...] "if you can move past Justin Bieber’s bizarre stage entrance, flying in on a set of ginormous metal wings to the tune of 'All Around the World', it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> his show".|$|E
500|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to foil Sephiroth's theft of the Black Materia, Aerith ventures alone into the Forgotten City. Cloud and his companions give chase, {{eventually}} finding her praying at an altar. As Aerith looks up <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the torso. Cloud carries Aerith's body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases {{her back to the}} Planet. Reeve Tuesti, the head of Shinra Urban and Development, brings the news of her death to Elmyra Gainsborough, Aerith's adoptive mother. The party later learns the reason for Aerith being in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aerith was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor, which has been summoned by Sephiroth. Although Aerith successfully cast Holy before her death, it is held back by the power of Sephiroth's will. When Sephiroth is finally defeated and Holy is released, it appears that it is too late to function as effectively as it should, as Meteor has already come too near to the Planet's surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on Holy in opposite directions weakens it. Aerith is seen praying with both hands interlocked whilst urging the lifestream to ultimately defend the planet. [...] The Planet's Lifestream then flows forth, intervening between Holy and Meteor, and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of Meteor.|$|E

500|$|Treves {{observed}} that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily. At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression. He {{had spent his}} entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance. His opinions about women were derived from his memories {{of his mother and}} what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal. The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, [...] "a young and pretty widow", to visit Merrick. She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion. He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> him, the first to shake his hand. She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of grouse (a pair of birds), is the only surviving letter written by Merrick. This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence. He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} appearance, GameDaily ranked Koffing ninth {{on their list}} of the [...] "Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon", call it [...] "basically a {{floating}} fart ball covered in pimples", and further described its design as bizarre and undelightful. However, InsertCredit's Tim Rodgers named {{it one of the}} top fifty video game icons, praising simplistic design and calling the skull-and-crossbones on its front [...] "attitudinous", while noting it as a notch above other similar, round mascots in video games. GamesRadar stated it was difficult not <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> its [...] "Grimace-like face and chipper demeanor", though called its evolution [...] "an abomination" [...] and [...] "very unsettling". Author Loredana Lipperini commented that while Weezing's skull indicates death, it is [...] "not very smart".|$|E
2500|$|Lines 53–57 {{feature the}} image of a singing poet, which is {{reminiscent}} of how the eclogue began. The poet himself will compete in a rustic environment against Orpheus and Linus, and Pan will be the judge. Virgil's reference to Linus in this section symbolizes [...] "the symbiosis of Hesiodic song culture and erudite, 'bookish' poetics of the so-called Alexandrian poets", resulting in a [...] "uniquely Virgilian pastoral aesthetic." [...] Once the Golden Age will have arrived, the need for arms and soldiers will be obviated, and the competitive drive that—in the past—had fueled war will now fuel [...] "harmless [...] competition for rustic prizes." [...] Lines 60–61 address the birth of the supposed savior, featuring the poet speaking directly to the child; he urges the baby <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> his mother, since she had just bore him. Lines 60–63 have proven throughout the ages to be a [...] "fascinating problem", and there is no clear consensus as to what exactly they mean. Nisbet claims that the final line is most likely a reference to a story about Hercules, who dined with Jupiter and took Juventas as his wife, although he noted it could also be a reference to a general Roman nursery saying.|$|E
