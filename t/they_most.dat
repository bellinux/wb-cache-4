5|$|Many rove beetles {{have greatly}} reduced elytra, {{and while they}} are capable of flight, <b>they</b> <b>most</b> often move on the ground: their soft bodies and strong {{abdominal}} muscles make them flexible, easily able to wriggle into small cracks.|$|E

5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. <b>They</b> <b>most</b> often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E

5|$|Adapids {{were most}} {{commonly}} found in Europe, although the oldest specimens (Adapoides from middle Eocene China) indicate that <b>they</b> <b>most</b> likely evolved in Asia and immigrated. They died out in Europe during the Grande Coupure, part of a significant extinction event {{at the end of}} the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|Cartman is {{considered}} to be the most popular character on South Park. Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom <b>they</b> <b>most</b> identify. South Park has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's politically incorrect behavior. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists {{as one of the most}} iconic television and cartoon characters of all time.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, <b>they</b> <b>most</b> often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur {{at any time of}} year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Bodø/Glimt, Grand Bodø also plays matches at Aspmyra. This includes their women's team, which has previously {{played in the}} Women's Premier League. <b>They</b> <b>most</b> recently played in the top league in 2007, when they drew an average 222 spectators. During the 1980s, Grand's men's club became the town's best, playing in the Second Division, the tier above Glimt.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros Xiphias {{was born}} {{probably}} some time around or before 980, and {{was most likely}} the son of Alexios Xiphias, {{who served as the}} Catepan of Italy in 1006–08. Few members of the Xiphiai are otherwise known and the family's origin is unclear, but <b>they</b> <b>most</b> likely hailed from Asia Minor, like many other prestigious families of the military aristocracy of the period.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters <b>they</b> <b>most</b> prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E

5|$|Usually made of silver, the Greek drachma coin, {{including}} the tetradrachm, was the standard currency {{used throughout the}} Parthian Empire. The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. <b>They</b> <b>most</b> likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5g or more than 4.2g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.|$|E
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. <b>They</b> <b>most</b> often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
5|$|Left {{with little}} {{recourse}} {{now that his}} German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed {{to the demands of}} the crowd over the objections of his opinionated Queen. This square was renamed Constitution Square (Πλατεία Συντάγματος) to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843—and to feature many later tumultuous events of Greek history. Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture <b>they</b> <b>most</b> esteemed) vied for rank and power.|$|E

5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; on another occasion, he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as the man <b>they</b> <b>most</b> needed to apprehend, but apart from the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E
