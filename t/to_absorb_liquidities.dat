40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of a continued divergence of TARGET 2 balances for monetary policy in the euro area. The accumulation of TARGET 2 claims (liabilities) would make ECB’s liquidity management asymmetric once the TARGET 2 claims in core countries have crowded out central bank credit in those regions. Then while providing scarce liquidity to banks in countries with TARGET 2 liabilities, the ECB will need <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> excess <b>liquidity</b> in countries with TARGET 2 claims. We discuss three alternatives and its implications <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> excess <b>liquidity</b> in core regions: (1) Using market based measures might accelerate the capital flight from periphery to core countries and would add to the accumulation of risky assets by the ECB. (2) Conducting non-market based measures such as imposing differential (unremunerated) reserve requirements would distort banking markets and would support the development of shadow banking. (3) Staying passive would lead to decreasing interest rates in core Europe entailing inflationary pressure and overinvestment in those regions and possibly future instability of the banking system. ...|$|R
40|$|Monetary policy {{measures}} {{taken by the}} Federal Reserve {{as a response to}} the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and subsequent economic conditions led to a large increase in the level of outstanding reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control short-term market rates in this situation. We study several of these tools, namely, interest on excess reserves (IOER), reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs), and the term deposit facility (TDF). We find that overnight RRPs (ON RRPs) may provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because they are available <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> daily <b>liquidity</b> shocks. Whether the TDF or RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the intensity of interbank monitoring costs versus balance sheet costs, respectively, that banks face. In our model, using the RRP and TDF concurrently may most effectively stabilize short-term rates close to the IOER rate when such costs are rapidly increasing...|$|R

Levine, EUI; Prof. Bruno Maria Parigi, University of Padua; Prof. Hans Degryse, University of LeuvenThis thesis {{consists}} of two essays concerning how banking regulations may promote financial stability. The first chapter investigates the competition-concentration-stability nexus from a novel perspective, by considering how concentration and, inter alia competition, affect the likelihood of an individual bank failing, {{and the likelihood of}} the bank failure spreading contagiously {{to the rest of the}} banking system. Competition is shown to reduce individual bank and systemic stability by reducing banks' profit buffers <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks. The impact of concentration on stability is more nuanced however, as increased concentration increases banks' profit buffers but also increases the concentration risk in the interbank market, widening the channel of contagion by which a liquidity shock can spread throughout the network. The second chapter concerns optimal ex-ante prudential regulation and ex-post resolution policy of globally systemically important banks. It characterises the conditions under which weakly capitalised, limitedly liable banks have incentives to 'gamble for resurrection' by investing in risky asset portfolios, in the knowledge that the downside risk is shifted onto the deposit insurance fund. In this context it is shown that a bank resolution by `bailing in' unsecured debt holders can restore the incentive for banks to act prudently, and that the bail-in should occur above the point of insolvency to ensure the bank has sufficient skin in the game. The interplay of three ex-ante prudential regulatory instruments is analysed: the minimum capital and total loss absorbing capacity requirements and the minimum capital buffer. The minimum capital and TLAC requirements are set to ensure that the bank has sufficient skin in the game to invest prudently and tradeoff the ex-post costs of bailing in unsecured debt holders, the cost of bailing out depositors and the cost of equity issuance, and minimum equity buffer is set to ensure an appropriate trigger for resolution.

40|$|The market-oriented {{approach}} {{promoted by}} the European Central Bank {{in the design of}} its refinancing operations creates incentives to credit insitutions to use actively the interbank market to manage their liquidity needs. In this context, we examine the ability of the overnight segment to guarantee the timely provision of unsecured funds to banks <b>to</b> smoothly <b>absorb</b> their <b>liquidity</b> shocks. This paper specifically focuses on the speed of reversion of transaction costs and available depth to their equilibrium levels in this market for overnight unsecured funds from 4 September 2000 to 31 December 2007.

40|$|The two-week MNB bill is {{a central}} {{component}} of Hungary’s monetary policy instruments; it is a key instrument of the central bank, the interest rate of which {{is identical to the}} central bank base rate. By mid- 2009, the outstanding amount of MNB bills reached HUF 3, 000 billion, which – in addition to representing one third of the central bank’s liabilities – accounts for {{a significant part of the}} domestic banking sector’s liquid assets. By using the two-week bill <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> the excess <b>liquidity</b> of the banking sector, the central bank ensures that developments in banks’ interest rates will be driven by the MNB bill as an opportunity cost. The volume of these liquid assets builds up gradually, regardless of banks’ willingness to lend. Indeed, the growth observed in the holdings of MNB bills helped to relieve the liquidity tensions of credit institutions and contributed to gradually reducing the role of this factor in the decline in lending activity in 2009. Nonetheless, lending remained restrained despite the ample liquidity, which primarily reflects banks’ deteriorating risk appetite. One of the major correlations in the central bank’s balance sheet is the fact that, while credit institutions are free to decide on the volume of two-week MNB bills they purchase at the individual level, they are unable to affect the volume of bills in the overall banking sector. The accelerated growth rate in the volume of two-week bills observed in the previous year resulted from the use of foreign currency loans to finance the general government, which implies that the large volume of two-week bills is a consequence of poor demand in the government securities market, rather than the reason for this. In a regional comparison, however, the relatively high central bank base rate does not affect the volume of the key instrument, as the central bank interest rate has no direct impact on the liquidity of the banking sector. central banks' monetary policy instruments, open market operations, determining interest rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1993. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 85 - 90) Microfiche. x, 90 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmIn adopting an interest-pegging {{policy to}} finance the "Second World War, the Federal Reserve had essentially surrendered its ability to control the money supply. Monetary policy was implicitly abandoned. During the pegging period, monetary growth had to be whatever was required to keep interest rates at their pegged level. If some exogenous shock tended to increase interest rate, the Fed would have to purchase government securities and thus caused the money supply to increase. As interest rates tended to fall, the Fed would have to sell government securities <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> excess <b>liquidity</b> at the pegged rates and therefore money supply would fall. The Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951 provides {{a unique opportunity to}} explore the impact of a change in a monetary regime. The shift in the monetary regime - away from pegging the interest rate - was a well-publicized event. People were aware of the implications and adjusted their economic behavior accordingly. Inflationary expectations were lowered and so was the substitutability of government securities for money balances due to the Accord. Higher interest rate volatility means higher risk in terms of capital losses on the part of holders' of government securities as the price of government securities varies inversely with the interest rate. Government securities were no longer a close substitute for money balances as they were during the price-pegging era. The revival of an independent monetary policy was possible only after the Accord. Instead of being an "engine of inflation," the Fed returned to the "driver's seat" {{for the first time since}} 1942. By abandoning the pegging of long-term rates, the Fed regained its ability to control the money supply. Ironically, the Fed did not tighten up the money supply despite enormous inflation generated by the Korean War. Money supply increased at an even faster rate, and yet wholesale prices started to fall. This was one of the few episodes in American financial history that the economy experienced decreasing inflation along with an acceleration in the rate of monetary growth. This observation contradicts most macro-economic theories which maintain a positive relationship between monetary growth and change in the price level. The apparent paradox can be explained by an increase in demand for money after the Accord applying the loanable funds model. The thesis of the study is to 1) demonstrate the ability of the loanable funds model to explain the monetary actions during the price-pegging period and 2) examine the structural change in the demand for money as a result of the shift in the monetary regime recognizing the endogeneity of the money supply...|$|R

In particular, {{we are interested in}} payments behaviour towards a bank that is, for operational reasons, unable to make but able to receive payments. If other banks did not sufficiently monitor their outgoing payments, these operational shocks could impact the entire payment system because the affected bank could <b>absorb</b> <b>liquidity</b> from the system. Our game-theoretic model predicts that only early in the day, when they are uncertain about the payment instructions they might have to execute, banks stop sending payments to a counterparty which is unable to make payments.

If banks do not su ¢ ciently monitor their outgoing payments, operational shocks can impact the entire payment system: the stricken bank <b>absorbs</b> <b>liquidity.</b> We …rst build a game-theoretic {{model in which}} a bank’s decision to make payments depends on whether another bank experiences operational problems, and {{on the time of}} day at which the outage occurs. We then investigate these reactions empirically using a non-parametric method. Our theory predicts that banks stop paying to a stricken bank early in the day, when they are uncertain about the payment instructions they might have to execute. When this uncertainty has been resolved (later in the day), healthy banks make payments even to stricken banks. Both predictions are supported by the data. We show that this behaviour e¤ectively contains the disruption caused by the operational outage: payment ‡ows between healthy banks remain virtually uninterrupted. ...|$|R
