5000|$|Like the sayaw (meaning [...] "dance") in the WEKAF system, the ARPI {{system has}} a {{separate}} single and team choreographed division called Anyo (Tagalog for 'forms').

5000|$|<b>Baton</b> <b>twirling</b> {{started in}} Western Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where {{performers}} used knives, rifles, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The sport progressed into {{the armies of}} some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler {{to the front of}} the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a [...] "mace". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace bearer or [...] "drum major" [...] <b>twirled</b> the <b>baton</b> whilst leading the army or band. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females ("drum majorettes") and the progression of twirling that prompted the lightening and balancing of the baton. The sport came to North America when Major Reuben Webster Millsaps created <b>baton</b> <b>twirling</b> when he established Millsaps College in Mississippi after the US Civil War.|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty or {{errors are}} {{introduced}} in fluid flow data as {{the data is}} acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little {{has been done to}} incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. This work presents UFLOW – a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, <b>twirling</b> <b>batons</b> of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity especially near critical points in the flow field...|$|R
