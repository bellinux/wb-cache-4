5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>stereotype</b> emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E

5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from <b>the</b> <b>stereotype,</b> he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. <b>The</b> <b>stereotype</b> of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E

5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It {{is only in the}} successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stereotyping,</b> {{a key to}} the {{reception}} and the learning. The claim {{of this article is to}} show the importance of <b>the</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in <b>the</b> processes of reception and learning and the necessity for the teachers to be conscious of its working to be able to combine functional and critical steps. In this aim three questions are examined : 1 - What do we call stereotyping? We propose to define it as a process of production and reception, susceptible to reveal itself at varied levels, carrier of diverse values, and approachable to various disciplinary points of view. 2 - What role plays <b>the</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in <b>the</b> approach of reception? Any construction of the sense aims towards <b>stereotyping.</b> However, if <b>the</b> functional reception limits itself to this process, in a reception with aesthetic aim, <b>the</b> <b>stereotyping</b> gives soon place to the suspension of sense and to the indeterminations. 3 - What about <b>the</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in <b>the</b> approach of learning? As receptive attitude, any learning tends, more or less, to mobilize and to confirm previous knowledges. The learning with critical or reflexive aim includes however a phase of suspension and opening to the new elements, which keeps pace with a recontextualisation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of activation of a negative stereotype on behaviors that are perceived to increase the chance of becoming a member of <b>the</b> <b>stereotyped</b> group. Activation of a negative <b>stereotype</b> (<b>the</b> overweight <b>stereotype)</b> is shown to lead to stereotype-consistent goal commitment (low health goal commitment), which partially explains increases in stereotype-conducive behavior (eating indulgent foods). Two theoretically relevant moderators are proposed and supported. Increased accessibility of the countervailing health goal and increased accessibility {{of the link between}} the behavior and membership in <b>the</b> <b>stereotyped</b> group both limit <b>the</b> effect of <b>stereotype</b> activation on stereotype-conducive behavior. Five experiments support the facilitative effect of stereotype activation on stereotype-conducive behavior, the role of goal commitment, and both moderators. ...|$|R

The employment of qualitative method was to explore <b>the</b> concept of <b>stereotypes</b> among <b>the</b> ethnic groups. Quantitative phase involves the formation of items by themed and categorised the items that were built from the qualitative phase. A total of 1, 000 university students from various ethnic groups in Malaysia {{were involved in the}} quantitative phase. Exploratory factor analysis on ISMEM has formed two main components labelled as Antecedents Stereotypes and Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes.</b> <b>The</b> psychometric assessment of ISMEM involves i) testing the construct validity between <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon Stereotypes; (ii) determining the convergent validity between <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon Stereotypes; (iii) testing the reliability coefficient of <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes,</b> and (iv) examining the item quality of <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes.</b> An assessment of the suitability of data for factor analysis was conducted before the psychometric assessment was carried out. The correlation (r≥. 30) between the scores of <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> suggested a reasonable factoring. Construct validity test such as the Test Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, the Bartlettt's Test of Sphereity, the communality, the load factor, the Eigen value and the percentage of variance factor in both components of <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and <b>the</b> Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> are reasonable. <b>The</b> reliability value of Cronbach Alpha for <b>the</b> Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> (α =. 897 -. 933) and <b>the</b> Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> are well accepted (α =. 706 -. 821).
