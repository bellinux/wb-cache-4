40|$|The {{opportunity}} to select and perform qualified musical literature on a graduate recital offers the individual music teacher {{a challenge that}} is commensurate with the duties of his profession. A major responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> is the selection, rehearsal, and performance of the best possible literature that will meet the educational aesthetic needs of his particular performing group. It could be {{said that one of}} the most potent factors in preserving and expanding the musical culture of our society is the part played in it by <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> and his wisdom and choice that he displays with this obligation. When the author began his recital preparation, little did he realize the amount of growth and progress that would have to take place before he would be able to schedule and perform a repertoire that would do justice to all concerned. To begin with, the writer had an insufficient realization of his own performance capabilities. During his undergraduate years he did not accomplish a high degree of artistry and facility in the performance medium either vocally or instrumentally. This, to be sure, was always deeply realized but justified inasmuch as the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> was to know a little about a vast and overwhelming area of performance demands. Originally, the recital program outline included performance on two of three woodwind instruments. Shortly thereafter this writer changed employment and devoted his energies to vocal and choral music. As a result of this change he began a serious study of the voice with Professor Marie Puffer at Utah State University with hopes of obtaining a proficient degree of performing ability as a competent music educator and amateur orator and operatic performer. During the summer of the 1964 the final recital draft was approved and called for the performance of alto saxophone literature, the singing of bass-baritone operatic, lieder, and the performance of an a Capella choir that is being directed by the author at Ogden High School. Justification of a recital that includes more than one performing medium could prove to be arduous to the competent specialist. But the writer firmly believes that there are many close similarities that exist between the vocal and instrumental performing medium. Certainly the discipline that is required by the notation system is worthy in itself. Expression, nuance, and the aesthetic nature of instrumental and vocal music offer innumerable parallels of complimentary study. H. A. VanderCook has this to say about expression in music. [...] . When a group has been drilled by an instructor who has experienced understanding of the grammar of music and the factors governing playing with expression, it is readily discernible that the players are attempting to meet the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s ideals; that they are striving in every way to secure pleasing results and to do something besides merely sounding all the notes [...] . The importance of playing in good style with proper expression is too often neglected by the teacher, as a natural consequence, by those studying under him [...] . The authority Arban, in referring to playing with expression, writes: 2 ̆ 2 This circumstance(accent and expression) affords the performer and {{opportunity to}} rest while he continues to play and enables him to introduce effective contrasts into the execution at the same times 2 ̆ 2 It is not enough for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> to be a fine performer on an instrument. To a certain extent these attributes are inborn, primitive and natural in the musician. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> must be an artist as well, with a sound theoretical and musical knowledge of the fundamental basis for his success. Artistic performance is the result of combining sensitive taste and feeling with the established musical knowledge and technical 2 ̆ 2 know-how 2 ̆ 2. The importance of 2 ̆ 2 musicality 2 ̆ 2 is often underestimated by the teacher of music in the public schools. Often this is the result of negligence on the part of the director to explore the vast area of style and interpretation. Equally important is the lack of fundamental musicianship. Nothing is more essential to a potential music educator than well-rounded musicianship with a thorough background of style and interpretation...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} {{for music educators}} tobe responsible for teaching students withspecial learning needs who have been in-cluded {{in the general education}} classroom.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a tool {{known as the}} Haptic Drum Kit, which employs four computer-controlled vibrotactile devices, one attached to each wrist and ankle. In the applications discussed here, haptic pulses are used to guide the playing, on a drum kit, of rhythmic patterns that require multi-limb co-ordination. The immediate aim is to foster rhythm skills and multi-limb coordination. A broader aim is to systematically develop skills in recognizing, identifying, memorizing, retaining, analyzing, reproducing, and composing polyphonic rhythms. We consider the implications of three different theories for this approach: the work of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> Dalcroze (1865 - 1950 [1]; the entrainment theory of human rhythm perception and production [2, 3]; and sensory motor contingency theory [4].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study {{represents}} an illustration of the techniques of public relations in music education as well as the urgent necessity for their development. Especially during; this era, American public schools are faced with the problem of providing a balanced curriculum whose chief interests lie in subjects of a scientific nature. Educators feel that this type of training is not only necessary to keep the nation ahead or equated with others scientifically, but that it is inevitably the best in preparing the student for adulthood. Public school music, in many instances, has not lived up to its responsibilities in providing the kinds of music and the type of community service it should render. Consequently, many educators feel justified in either reducing or eliminating fine arts programs in their schools. It is necessary, therefore, that <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> study measures of encouraging musical growth in his environment, and this growth can be assured through a study of the techniques and tools of public relations...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} experiences a person can have is to present to an audience the expressions and ideas of a musical composition the way one believes best conveys the thoughts of the composer. It {{is for this reason}} that the writer decided on the recital as the means of fulfilling the requirements for a creative project. It is all important for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> to be capable of selecting and presenting a musical program which meets the demands expected at a professional or a graduate level. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> must have a thorough knowledge of how to express himself musically so he can transmit to his students, by his actions, the ideas which are necessary for a sound musical performance. Students soon become aware of the fact that the teacher does not feel or understand the music which is being presented and thus many discontinue their musical education. The writer feels that because of the hours of preparation and research on the works presented he is now better qualified to rehearse and prepare an individual or a group for a concert or a recital. The recital also gave the writer an opportunity to present some of the best and most technically challenging literature which has been written for the clarinet. The technical advancement made from the hours of practice has prepared the writer for any phase of musical endeavor. Instead of analyzing and writing down what has already been said in the performance, the writer felt it would be better to enlighten the reader about the little known history of the clarinet and the music which was available to the performer in the eighteenth century. The selections within the recital were of the romantic, impressionistic, and contemporary periods. Therefore, the reader could, by listening to the recordings and reading the paper, set a picture of the development of the clarinet, from the primitive beginning, to the utmost in technical advancement, the modern clarinet. It is with this idea in mind that the creative project was undertaken. Creative project, 4 hrs. Thesis (M. A. E. ...|$|E
