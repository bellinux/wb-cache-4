50|$|In 1940, Major Phyllis Dunning (née Phyllis Doreen Hooper) {{became the}} first South African woman to enter {{full-time}} military service as the Commander of the South African Women's Auxiliary Air Force (SAWAAF). In 1941, the Southern Rhodesia Women's Auxiliary Air Service was commissioned. Within a few months over 100 women recruits were providing clerical services, sewing skills, parachute packing, and serving as drivers, equipment assistants and mechanics. Another South African, Rosamund Steenkamp {{became the first}} woman in the world to fly a jet, when she flew a Gloster Meteor III in August 1945, which was still in its experimental stages, for the British Air <b>Transport's</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> Service.|$|R
25|$|The Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> {{established}} No. 2 Ferry Pilots Pool at Whitchurch during 1940.

The unit was disbanded in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Noël Agazarian's {{father was}} Berge Agazarian (died 1944), an Armenian {{who arrived in}} the United Kingdom in 1911 as a {{teenager}} with little money. However he eventually prospered, owning a successful electrical engineering company. He married Frenchwoman Jacqueline Marie-Louise le Chevalier. They had six children, four boys (three of whom later joined the Royal Air Force) and two girls, one of whom, Monique Agazarian, later served as a pilot in the Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Auxiliary.</b> The four siblings' interest in aviation may have been sparked by their mother, who bought a World War I surplus Sopwith Pup fighter for £5 at a Croydon auction, and parked {{it in the back}} garden of the family house for use as a plaything by her children.|$|E
25|$|The flying replicas were {{specifically}} {{chosen to}} be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, {{but there were a}} few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, a forerunner of today's ultralight aircraft, was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle's designer and first pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, Joan Hughes, a wartime member of the Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive Demoiselle flew very well, and Hughes proved a consummate stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.|$|E
