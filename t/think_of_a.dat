5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio began to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supernatural {{spin on the}} pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, {{which was based on}} a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way to get their clients back.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects {{is known as}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way that the US could {{find out if the}} Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

25|$|The club courted {{controversy}} in 1949 by signing German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann {{as a replacement}} for England international Frank Swift, who had retired.

25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|E

25|$|Schellenberg says he hasn't {{seen any}} serious {{objections}} to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder {{writes about the}} possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.|$|E
25|$|Abstraction (or modularity) – Types enable programmers {{to think}} {{at a higher}} level than the bit or byte, not bothering with {{low-level}} implementation. For example, programmers can begin to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express interfaces between two of any-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.|$|E
25|$|The Turner-Ownbey long {{distance}} telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned {{herself in the}} Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records {{were supposed to be}} sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.|$|E

25|$|In Kandy, Rajasingha faced discontented nobles and a populace who {{had always}} been opposed to the {{alliance}} with the Dutch. The internal situation became so unstable {{that for a while}} Rajasingha was forced to abandon the palace and allow rebels to seize control of Sengkadagala, and even suspended the annual Perahara. In 1664, he faced open rebellion from a noble known as Ambanwela Rala, and, unable in his fury to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable punishment, sent him to the Dutch, assuming they would execute him as a Kandyan noble. It was a mistake — Ambanwela Rala traded his knowledge of the workings of Kandy for a large coconut estate in Dutch territory and died a rich man.|$|E

I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
