Asser also stated that Anarawd abandoned his Viking alliance because it brought him no benefit and submitted to Alfred.

Though Mapai Labour leaders attempted to prepare the way for an agreement with Germany by mitigating anti-Nazi sentiment within Zionist circles, prominent Revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky steadfastly opposed them. In a radio broadcast on April 28, 1933, Jabotinsky strongly condemned any possible pact between Zionism and Hitler. Jabotinsky upheld in his radio address the Revisionist platform for an international economic boycott on German exports, suggesting in addition that the British Mandate of Palestine should assume {{the lead in the}} boycott efforts.|$|E

25|$|The last {{philosophy}} {{book that}} Feyerabend finished is <b>The</b> <b>Tyranny</b> <b>of</b> Science (written 1993, published May 13, 2011). In it Feyerabend challenges {{what he sees}} in his view as some modern myths about science, e.g., {{he believes that the}} statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about the nature of human life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of our age, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that make life meaningful.|$|E
25|$|After {{traveling}} to Egypt, Greece, and possibly India, Pythagoras moved (around 530 BC) to Croton, in Italy (Magna Graecia). Possibly <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> Polycrates in Samos {{made it difficult}} for him to achieve his schemes there. His later admirers claimed that Pythagoras was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens, that he moved to Croton. On his arrival in Croton, he quickly attained extensive influence, and many people began to follow him. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speech in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.|$|E
25|$|Southern Afghanistan {{was under}} the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the {{government}} in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and their militias. In 1994, the Taliban (a movement originating from Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> the local governor. Mullah Omar started his movement with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students in his hometown of Kandahar. When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities. In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.|$|E
