5|$|During the 1970s, the Patriots {{had some}} success, earning a berth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in 1976—as {{a wild card}} team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost {{in the first round}} both times. In 1985, they {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> and made {{it all the way to}} Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.|$|E
