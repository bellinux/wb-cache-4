6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry to}} say that your landlord's wery bad to-night, Sir,' said Roker, setting down the glass, and {{inspecting}} the lining of his hat preparatory <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{had slipped}} {{one of his}} feet out of his huge carpet slippers, and, as he reached down <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> he added calmly: [...] "And ez to yer marrying her it ain't to be done." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{dropped on}} the step just below her and mopped his forehead. Neither of them could say anything. He took off his horn-rimmed eye-glasses, {{carefully}} inserted {{the point of a}} pencil through the loop, swung them in a buzzing circle, and started <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Good," [...] said Sir Henry; [...] "you have {{appeared}} {{in this country in}} a certain character, and you must live up to it. It will never do for you <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trousers <b>again.</b> Henceforth you must exist in a flannel shirt, a pair of boots, and an eye-glass." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{there was}} nothing to do but <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> Before I had {{finished}} this operation Billali himself arrived with undignified and unusual haste. I asked him what was the matter, and he answered inconsequently that the Black One, the slayer of Rezu, was at the door [...] "with his axe." ...|$|R
50|$|Production {{eventually}} restarted at {{the plant}} in early 2008 but almost immediately had <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold <b>again,</b> for the repair of an underwater lift that moves fuel for reprocessing.|$|R
50|$|Ruth - Ruth {{starts on}} the mortar and the tiles simultaneously, {{causing her to}} not use the trowel to create the grooves needed to hold the tiles in place, causing the mortar to fill the gaps between tiles, and also causing her tiles to fall. Frustrated by her work, Michelle pulls off her tiles and tries <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|DEAR MR. HALL,--I am {{sincerely}} {{glad you}} are going to sell L. A. L. I am glad you are shutting off the agents, and I hope the fatal book will be out of our hands before it will be time <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> With nothing but our non-existent capital to work with the book has no value for us, rich a prize as it will be to any competent house that gets it.|$|R
50|$|Janis's {{negative}} {{body image}} {{has been a}} popular topic over the years. She sees herself as {{at least a little}} overweight, and unworthy of wearing a two-piece swimsuit. Arlo, on the other hand, persistently tries to convince her <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the bikini <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Once in America in {{the month}} of June, a mower hung up his coat under a shed near a barn: two or three days passed before he had {{occasion}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> Thrusting his arm up the sleeve he found it completely filled with something, and on pulling out the mass he found it to be the nest of a wren completely finished and lined with feathers. What a pity that all the labor of the little pair had been in vain! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} now busied {{himself in}} laying the cloth, in which process Mr Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own {{knife and fork}} in the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them. When everything was ready, the landlord took off the cover for the last time, and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of supper, {{that if he had}} offered <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again</b> or had hinted at postponement, he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth.|$|R
50|$|An elf cursed to {{eternally}} wear {{a magical}} suit of armor she donned {{in order to}} protect her city from an evil giant. After a few comical attempts by TWHE to strip her of the armor, she finally manages to remove it, only <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it back <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good indeed," [...] {{the general}} said with a laugh. [...] "As far as {{appearances}} go, you would pass anywhere. The only criticism I can make is that your boots look too new, {{but that is a}} fault that will soon be mended. A few days' knocking about, especially as I fancy {{we are going to have}} bad weather, will take the shine out of them, and, once off, take good care not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> A Boer with clean boots would be an anomaly indeed. Now, I will detain you no longer." ...|$|R
25|$|Both Ray Illingworth and Bill Lawry {{have done}} some mystifying things this series, but the English captain must about win the prize with his {{decision}} not to force Australia to follow on...I know, for sure, that our captain in South Africa, Ali Bacher, would have told Lawry <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the pads <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No one else, sir," [...] Tom said, {{and then}} {{followed}} the doctor aft. A basin of soup {{and a glass}} of sherry did wonders for the boys, and in an hour they proceeded to the captain's cabin, dressed in clothes which the doctor had borrowed from two of the midshipmen for them, for their own could never be worn again; indeed, they had not brought their jackets from the raft, those garments having shrunk so from the water, that the boys had not been able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> after first taking them off to dry.|$|R
60|$|I got up {{very slow}} and began <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my coat <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> and twice I 'ad {{to tell that}} silly woman that when I wanted her 'elp I'd let 'er know. Then I 'eard slow, heavy {{footsteps}} in the road outside, and, afore any of 'em could stop me, I was calling for the police.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall go home at once, {{and turn}} in," [...] he said. [...] "Straining at those cords {{has taken the}} skin off my wrists, and I feel stiff all over; {{it will be a}} day or two, Gibbons, before I am able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the gloves <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> I wish I could find that Lascar; I owe him a heavy debt." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was at a}} farm-house {{once when}} some high holiday was being celebrated. I don't {{remember}} what the occasion was, {{but it was something}} festive, a May Day or Quarter Day, or something of that sort, and they put a garland of flowers round the head of one of the cows. Well, that absurd quadruped went about all day as perky as a schoolgirl in a new frock; and when they took the wreath off she became quite sulky, and they had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again</b> before she would stand still to be milked. This is not a Percy anecdote. It is plain, sober truth.|$|R
60|$|She {{had only}} removed her gown {{when she had}} lain down, having done this in order {{that it should not}} be burned by the acid, and that her neck and {{shoulders}} might be seen, and the belief induced that this strange eruption was all over her. Rabda made signs for her <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again,</b> and pointing in the direction of Cawnpore, repeated the word several times, and Isobel felt with a thrill of intense thankfulness that the stratagem had succeeded, and that she was to be sent away at once, probably to the place where the other prisoners were confined. Presently the woman returned.|$|R
5000|$|Despite DeRosa's limited playing time, {{he became}} an {{important}} mentor for his Nationals teammates, {{many of whom are}} much younger. The day after the Nationals lost the game five of the divisional series to the St. Louis Cardinals reporters asked him if he was going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a uniform <b>on</b> <b>again</b> (<b>to</b> retire) and DeRosa stated [...] "I don't know if I'm okay with that yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, my ring!" [...] he exclaimed, {{slipping}} {{it on the}} forefinger of his right-hand. [...] "I forgot <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again</b> this morning. Strange, I {{never missed}} it! See, Tessa," [...] he added, as he spread out the smaller articles, and selected the one he was in search of. [...] "See this pretty little pointed bit of red coral--like your goat's horn, is it not?--and here is a hole in it, so you can <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> the cord round your neck along with your Breve, and then the evil spirits can't hurt you: if you ever see them coming in the shadow round the corner, point this little coral horn at them, and they will run away. It is a `buona fortuna,' and will keep you from harm when I am not with you. Come, undo the cord." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, it was {{announced}} that the Thorp reprocessing plant would be closed in 2010 (later extended to 2018 to allow completion of agreed contracts). Originally predicted to make profits for BNFL of £500m, by 2003 it had made losses of over £1bn. Subsequently, Thorp was closed for almost two years from 2005, after a leak had been undetected for 9 months. Production eventually restarted at the plant in early 2008; but almost immediately had <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold <b>again,</b> for an underwater lift that takes the fuel for reprocessing to be repaired.|$|R
60|$|This event {{caused many}} of those who were about <b>to</b> sail, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> foot <b>again</b> <b>on</b> firm land, ready to {{encounter}} any evil rather than to rush into the yawning jaws of the pitiless ocean. But these were few, in comparison to the numbers who actually crossed. Many went up as high as Belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through Scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into England.|$|R
60|$|I {{almost fell}} upon the deck with the tumult of mingled {{emotions}} that filled my heart as I gazed ardently towards my beautiful island. It was still many miles away, but sufficiently near to enable me to trace distinctly the well-remembered {{outlines of the}} two mountains. My first impulse was to utter an exclamation of gratitude for being carried to my former happy home in safety; my second, to jump up, clap my hands, shout, and {{run up and down}} the deck, with no other object in view than that of giving vent to my excited feelings. Then I went below for the telescope, and spent nearly ten minutes of the utmost impatience in vainly trying to get a focus, and in rubbing the skin nearly off my eyes, before I discovered that having taken off the large glass to examine the phosphoric water with, I had omitted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
50|$|Throckmorton {{was brought}} to trial at the Guildhall on 17 April 1554. He managed to {{convince}} the jury, which included Simon Lowe alias Fyfield, of his innocence, although the judges were openly hostile to him. They included Sir Roger Cholmeley, {{who was trying to}} impress Queen Mary. As a result of the verdict, the court fined and imprisoned the jury and sent Throckmorton to the Tower. When he was released the next year, he fled to exile in France. Though people wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him <b>on</b> trial <b>again,</b> he was pardoned in 1557, and was employed by Queen Mary.|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice was}} quietly even, {{and there was}} {{certainly}} no suggestion in it that she resented what he had done; but Jimmy {{knew that he was}} now expected <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> his reserve <b>again,</b> and he hastened to explain in conventional fashion that the way she might regard the matter was really a question of interest to him. Then Anthea looked at him, and they both laughed as they turned away, which, as it happened, very nearly led to Jimmy's flinging prudence aside again, and he felt relieved when he saw Austerly and his daughter approaching them. Before the latter two joined them, Anthea, however, once more turned to her companion.|$|R
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, after the first {{democratic}} elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), caused the project <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold <b>again.</b> In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue {{at the site of}} the former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence.|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} his sentence in January 1924 Pérez Solís expected <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial <b>again</b> in Valladolid. To avoid this {{he left the}} country for France, and then represented the Spanish at the Comintern congress in Moscow. He returned to Paris, then returned to Spain after an amnesty late in the year.The PCE continued to decline, {{and most of its}} leaders were arrested. Pérez Solís became PCE secretary-general with the support of José Bullejos and Gabriel León Trilla.On 13 February 1925 he too was arrested in Barcelona. While in jail he was visited several times by the Dominican José Gafo Muñiz, a leader of Social Catholicism, and exchanged many letters with Father Gafo.|$|R
50|$|Public defender Paul Bennett (Gig Young) dedicates {{himself to}} {{defending}} a destitute {{man accused of}} murder. Some-time piano player Richard Kincaid (James Anderson) was brought to trial for the crime 12 years earlier, but {{he was sure he}} would be found guilty and escaped before the jury reached a verdict. Now recaptured, he is due <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial <b>again.</b> Bennett is faced with the task of tracking down the seven witnesses to a fight that Kincaid had with the murder victim before the crime. In the years since the first trial, World War II has come and gone and the lives of the witnesses have undergone major changes, most of them for the worse.|$|R
60|$|My master {{observed}} the whole performance with great signs of curiosity and admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was plain I {{must be a}} perfect Yahoo; but that I differed very much {{from the rest of}} my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin; my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on my two hinder feet. He desired to see no more; and gave me leave <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> my clothes <b>again,</b> for I was shuddering with cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor child, it is a {{shame to}} tease her," [...] said her father, raising up her face; [...] "I only wanted to know which of them you would wish <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the ring <b>again.</b> I see. You need not be afraid, you shall have the ruby one. But as for the little gold one, wait for that till it is <b>put</b> <b>on</b> in church, my dear. Ah! and there's the flutter of his wings, or rather the rattle of his spurs. Now then, young people, you shall not be {{hindered}} from a full view of each others lineaments. It is the first time you ever had a real sight of each other, neither of you being in a swoon, is it not? I trust you do not repent upon further acquaintance. Aurelia got as far as the shoe-buckles once, I believe." ...|$|R
5000|$|From this slavery {{there is}} no hope of freedom, because neither the parents nor the child will ever have {{sufficient}} money to repay the original loan. ... The cruelties to which the child slaves have been subjected, as related by those who have studied them, are as bad as anything that was ever reported of the cruelties of Negro slavery. These boy slaves were frequently beaten and pinched, in order to wring from their overburdened bodies the last drop of strength they had in them. When beatings did not suffice, it was the custom to singe the calves of their legs with lanterns <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>again</b> <b>on</b> their feet. If they sought to escape from this slavery in flight, they were captured and beaten, sometimes even killed.|$|R
5000|$|UC coach Mick Cronin, {{angry at}} how his players behaved, {{ordered them to}} take off their jerseys in the locker room, {{and in some cases}} {{physically}} took them off. In his postgame comments, a visibly angry Cronin said that he told his players not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again</b> [...] "until they have a full understanding of where they go to school and what the university stands for and how lucky they are to even be there, let alone have a scholarship." [...] He also hinted that several players could face suspensions, and possibly dismissal from the team, saying {{that he was going to}} review the tape with school president Gregory H. Williams and athletic director Whit Babcock [...] "and decide who's going to be on my team going forward." [...] He also appeared to blame the referees for not taking control of the situation sooner (threats of technicals after the first-half incident notwithstanding), saying that Musketeer players were yelling at his bench for the whole game and even cursing at his coaches. Cronin said he tried to call a time out before the brawl broke out so the players could go to their respective benches, but couldn't get the officials' attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{news from}} Kowfat affords one more {{instance}} of a painful back-down {{on the part}} of the Government. Our policy of spineless supineness is now reaping its inevitable reward. To us there is only one thing to be done. If the Shriek has torn off his suspenders he must be made <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> <b>again.</b> We have always held that where the imperial prestige of this country is concerned there is no room for hesitation. In the present instance our prestige is at stake: the matter involves our reputation in the eyes of the surrounding natives, the Bantu Hottentots, the Negritos, the Dwarf Men of East Abyssinia, and the Dog Men of Darfur. What will they think of us? If we fail in this crisis their notion of us will fall fifty per cent. In our opinion this country cannot stand a fifty per cent drop in the estimation of the Dog Men. The time is one that demands action. An ultimatum should be sent at once to the Shriek of Kowfat. If he has one already we should send him another. He should be made at once <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> his suspenders. The oil must be scraped off him, and he must be told plainly that if a pup like him tries to start a Jehad he will have to deal with the British Navy. We call the Shriek a pup in no sense of belittling him as our imperial ally but because we consider that the present is no time for half words and we do not regard pup as half a word. Events such as the present, rocking the Empire to its base, make one long for the spacious days of a Salisbury or a Queen Elizabeth, or an Alfred the Great or a Julius Caesar. We doubt whether the present Cabinet is in this class." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{literature}} developed {{in the last few}} years on Russia’s foreign policy by exploring six books which can be thought as representative: two general books on Russian foreign policy, one that focuses on security and intervention, another on Russia’s soft power and influence in the post-Soviet space, and two others on Russia’s relationship with the West. There is an underlying idea in the six books that Russian foreign policy has been deeply marked by Putin’s leadership. Russia’s foreign policy has been continuously evolving since 2000 towards assertiveness, through which Putin has aimed to regain Russia’s lost status of being a great power. In the last few years and especially since Putin came to power for the third time, there has been a proliferation of books on Russian foreign policy. The value of the six books lies in the way they chart the path towards assertiveness in Putin’s quest <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Russia <b>again</b> <b>on</b> the map as a great power...|$|R
