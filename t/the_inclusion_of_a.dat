The book follows {{the events of the}} film, but expands on Clear's backstory regarding her parents. The last adaptation to feature Clear was Final Destination II: The Movie, released 28 days following its precursor. Likewise co-written by Rhodes and Nancy A. Collins, the novel follows the events of Final Destination 2, with the substitution of a birthday cake in conducting the combustion and <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hospital orderly among the victims.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E

Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E

5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year.

Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error.|$|E

5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany {{and her hair}} and makeup artists, {{developed}} the character of Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German villain, Dr. Müller, who {{would go on to}} become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher than ever, and {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

5|$|In {{the credits}} of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, clips of Dream Drop Distance were shown {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secret ending related to the game, hinting at a {{possible}} additional collection. In September 2015, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. The collection features an HD remaster of Dream Drop Distance as well as Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover, a cinematic retelling of Kingdom Hearts χ that reveals new parts of the series' history, and Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, a new game taking place after {{the events of the}} original Birth by Sleep, told from the perspective of Aqua. It was released on January 12, 2017 in Japan and January 24, 2017 for other countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{designed}} to be the most humorous of Torchwoods second series and incorporated elements of broad comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story. It was filmed largely on location in South Wales—prominent locations included the tourist attractions Margam Country Park and Dyffryn Gardens—and featured an ensemble of previously unseen Welsh characters. The episode was seen by an aggregated total of 4.76 million viewers across its three debut showings in the United Kingdom. Critical response was extremely mixed, with some reviewers praising <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> less serious episode and others expressing the view that the comedy was too overt.|$|E
5|$|There was initial {{confusion}} as to {{how this}} game would be distributed to consumers, after the announcement {{that it would be}} a multiplayer-only title. Sony announced on May 16, 2007, that there would be two iterations of the game. The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US$29.99 (£19.99, €29.99), with an initial download size of 798MB. This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it. The second is a retail Blu-ray Disc version that sells for $59.99 (the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release), bundled with a Jabra BT125 Bluetooth headset in America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe, allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game. An additional third was later released on October 10, 2007 without <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> USB headset, which was priced at US$39.99. Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, concept art and trailers. Warhawk was re-released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28, 2008 for $29.99.|$|E
