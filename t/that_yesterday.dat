500|$|After {{a history}} of epileptic attacks, Patsy Custis died {{suddenly}} in Washington's arms in 1773. [...] The day following Patsy's death, Washington wrote to Burwell Bassett: [...] "It is an easier to conceive, than to describe, the distress of this Family, especially that of the unhappy Parent of our Dear Patcy Custis, when I inform you <b>that</b> <b>yesterday</b> re- moved the Sweet, Innocent Girl into a more happy & peaceful abode than any she has met with, the aflicted path she hitherto has trod." [...] Washington cancelled all business activity and, {{for the next three}} months, was not away from Martha for a single night. Patsy's death enabled Washington to pay off his British creditors, since half of her inheritance passed to him.|$|E

[...] Lin said that 100 trained militiamen came afterwards from Hsiang-fu's camp, but did not reach Wu-yung {{in time for the}} attack, and that in the afternoon, Qishan, Deng Tingzhen, and Yiliang began a meeting.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 September 1849 the diarist of the Washington {{expedition}} said of {{the western}} entrance to the park, [...] "I noticed towering pines and firs, also the oak, the aspen, and the willow; and bordering the stream {{there was a great}} variety of shrubbery, the hop vine, loaded with its fruit, being intertwined among them. [...] Flowers of rich profusion and of every hue and delicacy, were also constantly before the eye–upwards of ninety varieties having been picked up since we entered the gorge [...] yesterday. [...] Indeed, we are all in hopes <b>that,</b> <b>yesterday</b> and today, we have been having an earnest of what we may yet behold {{in this part of the}} world–a rich, well-timbered and sufficiently well-watered country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second common {{misconception}} is {{that all}} out-of-court statements are hearsay. This is not the case. An out of court statement {{may or may not}} be hearsay depending on the purpose for which it is offered. If the statement is being offered to prove the truth of what it asserts, then it becomes hearsay. When offered for any other purpose the statement is not hearsay. For example: Witness testifies <b>that</b> <b>yesterday</b> he spoke to Jim (who was in Vermont) on the phone and that Jim made the following statement, [...] "It's raining in Vermont!" [...] If the attorney is seeking to use this statement to prove that it was in fact raining in Vermont, then it is hearsay. But, if the attorney is seeking to use the statement to prove that the phone lines were working that day, or that Jim had not lost the power of speech, or for any other purpose, then the statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.|$|E

The ship was severely damaged, her aft part almost totally destroyed and the rest on fire. The crew fought the fire and were able to save the ship, but as Lieutenant England reported Our loss from the explosion, I here lament, has been very great; and Captain Miller, I am sorry to add, is of the number killed, which amount to 20; drowned, 9; and 45 wounded.|$|E
