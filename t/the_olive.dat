5|$|<b>The</b> <b>olive</b> groves are {{no longer}} {{cultivated}} {{on the grounds of}} Beaumont House, but other notable additions by Davenport to the Romanesque style still remain.

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. <b>The</b> <b>olive</b> baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
50|$|Bruzio oil is {{extracted}} from wholesome <b>olives,</b> harvested in <b>the</b> Southern territories of the Province of Cosenza. Physical and mechanical processes {{that keep the}} original characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> are used. After harvesting mature olives and pressing them, <b>the</b> wholesome <b>olives</b> are selected from all <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> harvested. These selected olives are then cleaned and defoiled, followed by them undergoing cleansing, milling, kneading and separation.|$|R
50|$|Duble — purely brine cured <b>olive.</b> <b>The</b> {{traditional}} {{method of}} curing {{is to put}} <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> into a two metre deep vats with weights {{on the top and}} brine circulating. The weights tenderize <b>the</b> <b>olives.</b> They are then stored in brine. The more commercial method is to use pressure vats, unfortunately this does not produce such a nice texture of olive. This is a firm salty olive.|$|R

The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it.

5|$|Meanwhile, a Crusader {{force of}} between 500 and 700 knights {{under the command}} of William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin {{advanced}} into the Peloponnese to deal with Byzantine resistance.

5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. <b>The</b> <b>olive</b> baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes. Corms and rhizomes are especially important in times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> grove of Kountouras in Messenia is unknown; the Greek {{version of the}} Chronicle records, apart from the owner's name (Kountouras or the variant form Koundouron), a location name Kepeskianous (Κηπησκιάνους), while a variant form is recorded as Kapsikia (Καψικία). Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it with the modern village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but this is too far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E
