To maximize the effectiveness of the method, a Taguchi robust design approach was applied to optimize the reaction in terms of the operating conditions influencing its outcome and the results were monitored by characterization of the Pr 2 (WO 4) 3 nanoparticles. Among the four parameters studied we found the dimensions of the produced nanoparticles to be determined by the concentrations of Pr 3 + and WO 43 − solutions and the reaction temperature, while the flow rate of adding the cation solutions to the anion solution was found to leave very negligible effects on the product characteristics. To confirm the effect of the optimizations on the outcomes of the reaction, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, FT-IR and UV-Vis structural and morphological characterizations of the products were performed, the results of which were in agreement with those statistically predicted in the optimization procedure.

Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> <b>of</b> different morphologies of yttrium oxide, a promising material for biological imaging applications. <b>Nanoparticles</b> <b>of</b> spherical, rod-like, and platelet morphologies were synthesized via solvothermal and hydrothermal methods and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), light scattering, surface area analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and zeta potential measurements.

Cellular response was different for the different morphologies, with spherical particles exhibiting no cytotoxicity to HFF cells, rod-like particles increasing cell proliferation, and platelet particles markedly cytotoxic. However, {{due to differences in}} the nanoparticle chemistry as determined through the characterization techniques, it is difficult to attribute the cytotoxicity responses to the particle morphology. Rather, the cytotoxicity of the platelet sample appears due to the stabilizing ligand, oleylamine, which was present at higher levels in this sample.

40|$|Increment of {{technical}} knowledge has remarkably uplifted logical thinking among scientific communities {{to shape the}} theoretical concepts into near product-oriented research. The concept of nanotechnology has overwhelmed almost all forms of lives and has traded its applications in myriad fields. Despite rapid expansion of nanotechnology, sustainable competitions still do exist {{in the field of}} agriculture. In current scenario, agriculture is a manifestation demand to provide adequate nutrition for relentless growing global population. It is estimated that nearly one-third of the global crop production is destroyed annually. The loss owes to various stresses such as pest infestation, microbial pathogens, weeds, natural calamities, lack of soil fertility and much more. In order to overcome these limitations, various technological strategies are implemented but a majority of these have their own repercussions. Hence there is a scrawling progress on the evaluation of nanoparticles into agriculture sector which can reform the modern agricultural system. Applications of these nanomaterials can add tremendous value in the current scenario of a global food scarcity. Nanotechnology can address the adverse effects posed by the abundant use of chemical agrochemicals which are reported to cause biomagnification in an ecosystem.

40|$|Abstract:Technology in the Twentieth century {{requires}} miniaturization {{of devices}} into nanometer sizes while their ultimate performance is dramatically enhance. This raises many issues regarding to new materials for achieving specific functionality and selectivity. Nanomaterials a new branch of materials research are attracting {{a great deal}} of attention because of their potential applications in areas such as Electronics. There are two ways of approaching the properties of nanoscale objects: the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach. In the first, one assembles atoms and molecules into objects whose properties vary discretely with the number of constituent entities, and then increases the size of the object until this discretisation gives way in the limit to continuous variation. The relevant parameter becomes the size rather than the exact number of atoms contained in the object. In the second case, one considers the evolution of the properties of a sample as its size is whittled down from macroscopic toward nanometric lengths. It is this approach that we shall examine here, whilst mentioning zones of overlap and exclusion between the two approaches. Nanomaterials plays a very important role in various applications. One of the best applications of Nanomaterials is for Energy Storage Applications. Since the surface reactivity increases in Nano dimensions, their structures play a very important role under these dimensions.

40|$|The forming of a {{porous layer}} <b>of</b> {{deposited}} <b>nanoparticles</b> on the heater surface {{is one of}} the unique phenomena in nucleate boiling of nanofluids.

40|$|Nanoparticles are {{commonly}} engineered {{with a layer}} of polymers on the surface used to increase their stability and biocompatibility, as well as providing multifunctional properties. Formulating the nanoparticle size and surface properties with polymers directly affects the way these nanoparticles interact with a biological system. Many previous studies have emphasized <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticle</b> size and surface charge in affecting their toxicity in cells. However, the potential weakness in many of these studies is that the polymer grafting densities on nanoparticles have been disregarded during toxicity evaluation. In the current study, we hypothesized that the density <b>of</b> polymers on <b>nanoparticles</b> will affect their toxicity to cells, especially for nanoparticle cores that are toxic themselves. To address this issue, we synthesized a range of RAFT (reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer) polymers bearing different surface charges and coated them onto silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) with different grafting densities. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these SiNPs was evaluated using the MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay with Caco- 2 cells. We found that neutral (biocompatible) polymers with a high grafting density on SiNPs were effective at protecting the cells from the toxicity of the silica core. High cellular toxicity was only observed for cationic polymer-SiNPs, while all other neutral and anionic polymer-SiNPs induced limited cellular toxicity. In contrast, the toxic effects induced by low density polymer-coated SiNPs were mostly attributed to the silica core, while the polymer coatings had a limited contribution.

In the present contribution, the short and long term colloidal stability <b>of</b> silica <b>nanoparticles</b> (SNPs) and silica–poly(ethylene glycol) nanohybrids (Sil–PEG) have been scrutinised in a protein model system. Well-defined silica nanoparticles are rapidly covered by bovine serum albumin (BSA) and form small clusters after 20 min while large agglomerates are detected after 10 h depending on both particle size and nanoparticle–protein ratio. Oppositely, Sil–PEG hybrids present suppressive protein adsorption and enhanced short and long term colloidal stability in protein solution. No critical agglomeration was found for either system in the absence of protein, proving that instability found for SNPs must arise as a consequence of protein adsorption and not to high ionic environment.

We show that icosahedrally shaped nanoparticles result in a blue-shifted absorbance, with a peak in the visible range. Alternatively, the nanoplate nanoparticles result in the characteristic NIR absorbance peak. Thus, we report that the NIR-contributing species in conventional gold-gold sulfide formulations are nanoplates that are comprised entirely of gold. Furthermore, polydisperse gold nanoparticle samples produced by the traditional one-step reduction of HAuCl 4 by sodium thiosulfate show increased in vitro toxicity, compared to isolated and more homogeneous constituent samples. This result exemplifies <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> developing monodisperse <b>nanoparticle</b> formulations that are well characterized in order to expedite the development of clinically beneficial nanomaterials.|$|R
30|$|An overall {{understanding}} of the effect <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticle</b> slip mechanisms for the augmentation of heat transport in nanofluids is in its infancy. In the past, several authors have attempted scaling analysis for convective transport of nanofluids to show the effect of slip mechanisms. Scaling analysis [4 – 6] is an effective tool to apply and develop mathematical models for describing transport processes. Through scaling analysis, the solution for any quantity that {{can be obtained from}} the governing equations can be reduced to a function of the dimensionless independent variables and the dimensionless groups. Ahuja [7] examined the augmentation in heat transport of flowing suspensions due to the contribution of rotational and translational motions by an order of magnitude analysis and concluded that the translational motion is expected to be negligibly small compared to that of the rotational motion of the particles. Savino and Paterna [8] performed order of magnitude analysis for Soret effect in water/alumina nanofluid and concluded that the thermofluid-dynamic behavior may be influenced by gravity and the relative orientation between the residual gravity vector and the imposed temperature gradient. Khandekar et al. [9] used scaling analysis for different nanofluids to show that entrapment <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> in the grooves of surface roughness leads to deterioration of the thermal performance of nanofluid in closed two-phase thermosyphon. Hwang et al. [10], in his study for water/alumina nanofluid, showed that both thermophoresis and Brownian diffusion have major effect on the particle migration and that the effect of viscosity gradient and non-uniform shear rate can be negligible. Buongiorno [11] estimated <b>the</b> relative <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> different <b>nanoparticle</b> transport mechanisms through scaling analysis for water/alumina nanofluid and concluded that Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis are the two most important slip mechanisms. Also, he ascertained that these results hold good for any nanoparticle size and nanofluid combination.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for colloidal nanoparticle synthesis has allowed scientists to fabricate materials that can manipulate {{light on a}} scale that is small even compared to the wavelength of the light itself. This ability has led to the {{development of}} myriad and diverse applications of nanostructures in wide-ranging fields. This thesis focuses on the investigation and exploitation of nanoscale material properties in the fields of medicine and energy. The unique optical properties <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> arise from their size and their high surface area to volume ratios compared to bulk materials. As a result of this relationship, the surface characteristics <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> generally dominate their properties, whereas in bulk materials the surface atoms have very little bearing on the properties of the composite. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to nanoparticles and their optical properties, including a discussion of the plasmon resonance and the properties imbued upon nanoparticles possesing such a resonance as well as the applicability of these properties that will be explored in the subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 presents a study of the interaction of cationic, hydrophobic gold nanoparticles as probes to elucidate specific regions of interest on cell surfaces. The high imaging contrast <b>of</b> gold <b>nanoparticles</b> in electron microscopy allows for visual, macroscopic observation of the aggregation patterns formed by these nanoparticles on cell surfaces. Plasmon resonant coupling between proximal nanoparticles is exploited in order to monitor nanoprobe binding and localization over time with the use of extinction spectroscopy. The role of surface proteins in the nanoparticle-cell surface interaction is elucidated, generating composite data with relevance in pharmaceutical development and pharmacokinetics. Additionally, bacteria strain-dependent toxicity is observed and subsequently investigated for smaller gold nanoparticle probes, demonstrating a potential use for nanoparticles as strain-specific antibiotics. The development of affordable, effective antibiotic technology is one of the major scientific challenges of our time; infections from pathogen-infested drinking water alone account for millions of deaths each year worldwide. In Chapter 3, we investigate the use of titanium dioxide as an inexpensive method to harness solar energy to split water into reactive species and thereby decontamitate solutions of E. coli. Though titanium dioxide is an excellent catalyst for water splitting, it requires UV irradiation, which is fairly lacking in the solar emission spectrum. Further, recuperation <b>of</b> titanium dioxide <b>nanoparticles</b> from solution is non-trivial, and its immobilization into a film greatly limits its surface area and charge carrier efficiency, thereby limiting its activity. We treat both the poor visible light absorption capability as well as the surface area limitation in this study. CdS semiconductor nanocrystals are used to extend the absorption edge of TiO₂ further into the visible light region of the spectrum by providing for lower-energy photon absorption and charge injection into titanium dioxide. TiO₂ is also electrochemically anodized to generate TiO₂ nanotube arrays, which have greatly increased surface area as well as more efficient charge transfer properties compared to thin films <b>of</b> TiO₂ <b>nanoparticles.</b> The utility <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> in increasing the light absorption of other systems continues as a theme in the work presented in the next two chapters. Chapter 4 ex- amines the plasmonic enhancement of the solar energy conversion in a biomimetic system. In this endeavor, we enhance the photocurrent generated by a light-transducing, proton-pumping protein, bacteriorhodopsin, in a 3 -dimensional wet electrochemical cell. First, we increase the overall charge carrier separation with the use of a proton- selective membrane in order to minimize ionic depolarization in the cell. We then use plasmonic nanoparticles to exploit an irregularity in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle known as the blue light effect. This effect shortens the timescale of the photocyle by more than 99 % via blue photon absorption, but it has a very low natural occurrence. Plasmonic nanoparticles tuned to the blue wavelength region increase the flux of blue photons on a local level and thereby increase the overall photocurrent generation. We first examine <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticle</b> field strength to photocurrent enhancement using silver nanospheres with different capping shell thicknesses. We then consider the trade-off between (1) using a nanoparticle with a plasmon resonance tuned perfectly to the blue wavelength region and (2) using a nanoparticle with a stronger field intensity but weaker energetic presence in the blue. By minimizing ionic depolarization, minimizing shielding of the plasmon electromagnetic field, and maximizing the field strength while maintaining the plasmon frequency at the proper wavelength, we demonstrate an enhancement of 5, 000 -fold in the photocurrent production by bacteriorhodopsin. Chapter 5 explores a variation on the theme of Chapter 4 with an application in cancer therapeutics. Here, a photodynamic cancer drug, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), is incorporated into complexes with silver nanospheres, gold nanospheres, and gold nanorods. Each <b>of</b> these <b>nanoparticles</b> displays a plasmon resonance in a different region of the spectrum, with consequent different overlap with the absorption or emission of the drug. Photodynamic therapeutic potential is measured in situ and in vivo, and the drug activity is shown to be strongest when drug absorption overlaps with plasmon resonance. Absorption by electronic excitations in the particle crystal lattice is shown to function as a competitive light filter and decrease drug activity. Additionally, the method of attachment of the drug to the nanoparticle is examined. Maximum enhancement of drug activity is shown to require the drug to remain bound close to the nanoparticle surface, where the electromagnetic field strength is highest. This plasmonic enhancement effect on drug activity is shown to outstrip the increase in drug activity seen when using the nanoparticle solely as a delivery platform. In Chapter 6, some synthetic techniques are presented for various nanomaterials. Included are syntheses for gold, silver, and semiconductor <b>nanoparticles</b> <b>of</b> a variety of shapes and sizes as well as for TiO₂ nanotube arrays. The relationship of the ratio of capping agent to metal salt is explored for gold nanospheres, and a method for facile tuning of the longitudinal plasmon resonance displayed by gold nanorods is presented. Synthetic techniques are also presented for the nanoparticles whose applications are explored in the preceding chapters. Ph. D...|$|R

In this study, we focused on biocompatibility issues, evaluating production of nitric oxide by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and macrophages, used as models of cells which would be exposed to nanoparticles after systemic administration. Methods: The nanoparticles tested were liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles carrying phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin, and PEGylated poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (PEG-PACA). We measured nitric oxide production using the Griess method as well as phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and intracellular free calcium, which are biochemically related to nitric oxide production. MTT viability tests and caspase- 3 detection were also undertaken. Results: Exposure to liposomes did not affect the viability of endothelial cells at any concentration tested. Increased production of nitric oxide was detected only with liposomes carrying phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin at the highest concentration (120 µg/mL), together with increased synthase phosphorylation and intracellular calcium levels. Macrophages exposed to liposomes showed a slightly dose-dependent decrease in viability, with no increase in production of nitric oxide. Exposure to solid lipid nanoparticles carrying phosphatidic acid decreased viability in both cell lines, starting at the lowest dose (10 µg/mL), with increased production of nitric oxide detected only at the highest dose (1500 µg/mL). Exposure to PEG-PACA affected cell viability and production of nitric oxide in both cell lines, but only at the highest concentration (640 µg/mL). Conclusion: Liposomal and PEG-PACA nanoparticles have a limited effect on vascular homeostasis and inflammatory response, rendering them potentially suitable for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, they highlight <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> testing such <b>nanoparticles</b> for production <b>of</b> nitric oxide in vitro in order to identify a therapeutic dose range suitable for use in vivo.

40|$|A stable high {{temperature}} gold nano-catalyst: synthesis, characterization and application The ability <b>of</b> supported gold <b>nanoparticles</b> to catalyse many reactions even {{at very low}} temperatures has spurred {{a great deal of}} research into the eld. Reactions such as CO oxidation and NOx reduction have many industrial applications as well as uses in the motor industry for catalytic converters. The interest is both for scienti c as well as economic reasons as gold supplies far exceed all PGM supplies. Scienti cally gold catalysts are able to catalyze reactions from below 0 °C, a feat that no PGM catalyst can achieve. The low temperature activity of gold catalysts will reduce the emission of pollutants during start up. Since the discovery and development of gold catalysts one of the most researched topics has been nding ways to stabilise the gold nanoparticles on the support surface. <b>The</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> gold <b>nanoparticle</b> stability is crucial as the catalysts are only highly active if the gold nanoparticles are less than 5 nm in size. A number of companies have worked to develop gold catalysts that are stable for long durations at temperatures over 450 °C with no signi cant progress made {{over the last two decades}} other than a catalyst produced by Toyota. In this thesis, literature reviews of current support materials as well as synthesis methods are investigated in order to determine reasons for the instability of current gold catalysts. Further, the Mintek Aurolite catalyst is tested and its deactivation mechanisms probed using in-situ VT-PXRD, Rietveld re nement, TEM, HR-TEM, as well as CO oxidation tests. Testing revealed aws in the support structure of the catalyst which resulted in dramatic deactivation. As titania is such a common support material for many reactions in industry as well as being known to be one of the best supports for gold it was chosen as a support material. However, as is revealed, in its current forms and morphologies it is unable to provide the thermodynamically stable and high surface areas that are required for a stable catalyst After the development of a robust and reproducible synthesis method for the deposition of gold and other PGM's a number of supports were tested. These include silica and zirconia as well as titania derivatives such as Degussa P 25 and commercial anatase. Initially these supports o er high usable surface areas but after a relatively small amount of time complete deactivation occurs. Reasons for this deactivation are determined and the information gained is used to develop supports that can combat these deactivation processes. Phase pure nano anatase is synthesised which produced a support with an incredibly large surface area compared to the aforementioned supports. The catalyst was able to withstand temperatures over 450 °C for longer durations compared to other catalysts exposed to the same conditions. However, the phase conversion of the anatase to its thermodynamically stable form rutile once again deactivated the catalyst with time. Finally a rutile nanosupport is developed with the desired morphology and thermodynamic stability needed for {{high temperature}} applications. The catalyst is able to withstand temperatures over 550 °C for more than 200 hours as well as still being active after exposure to 810 °C. The industrial Aurolite catalyst showed complete deactivation after just 12 hours at 500 °C. The catalyst produced in this thesis has been shown to be one of the most stable and thermally resistant gold catalysts in the world...|$|R
40|$|Trafikverket or Trafikverket’s {{contractors}} are considering {{the use of}} several products {{that in some way}} have to do with nanotechnology for sealing and impregnating various types of surfaces, for example road safety cameras. It has been noted that the potential health and environmental risks of nanomaterials should be evaluated over their entire life cycle. Further to previous risk assessments made on the nano-products considered by Trafikverket, it is therefore relevant to analyse the product’s impacts from a life cycle perspective. The aims of this project are to (i) Provide a state-of-the-art background on the types, production processes, uses and current debates on the classification, and human and eco-toxicity of nano-silica and silane based nanofilms, (ii) To analyse if there are any arguments, from an environmental perspective, for the application of self-cleaning coatings to speed cameras compared to conventional practice, (iii) To qualitatively discuss <b>the</b> potential <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticle</b> emissions from self-cleaning coatings in the context of other sources <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticle</b> emissions. A life cycle assessment is performed for maintenance of road safety cameras in Sweden in a business as usual (BAU) scenario and in a scenario where the cameras have been coated with a self-cleaning silane based nanofilm (Nano ProHard). The functional unit is the maintenance of road safety cameras in Sweden to allow for an acceptable speed camera picture quality over one year. The life cycle impact assessment methods ReCiPe Midpoint (Hierarchist) and Cumulative Energy Demand have been used. All life cycle phases from extraction of raw materials to end-of-life have been included. Inventory data is gathered from Ecoinvent 2. 2. The detergent used in the business as usual scenario is approximated with the Ecoinvent process "Soap, at plant/RER S" and the alkoxysilanes in NanoProHard with "Tetrachlorosilane, at plant/GLO S". Results show that the biggest impacts in the BAU-scenario are related to operation of vehicles for inspection of the road safety cameras in the maintenance phase, and to the production of soap. The biggest impacts in the Nano-scenario are related to operation of vehicles in the maintenance phase, and to production of soap, Nano ProHard Clean and Nano ProHard, mainly due to the ethanol in the product. Comparing the two scenarios (excluding operation of vehicles in the maintenance phase) it was seen that BAU had a bigger contribution than Nano in all impact categories except for fossil depletion, due to use of ethanol in the Nano-scenario. However, a sensitivity analysis revealed that this may not always be the case. It {{should also be noted that}} the toxicity in the use phase has not been assessed. In cases where very little detergent is used for cleaning, for example in those cases where only water is used in the BAU-scenario, it may not be beneficial to use a nanofilm. However, in case the road safety cameras are usually washed very often, and/or with big amounts of detergent, use of nanofilm could have lower GHG-emissions than maintenance in BAU-scenario. However, it can again be emphasised that the toxicity of the products in the use phase has not been assessed, and that this is an aspect that must also be considered when concluding on which maintenance regime to choose. It must also be noted that soap is not the commonly used detergent in maintenance, and that results could vary significantly depending on detergent used. It can be concluded that there are no clear environmental benefits if Trafikverket were to apply self-cleaning coatings to their road safety cameras, compared to conventional practice. The main source of impacts from maintenance of the road safety cameras is vehicle operation and this cannot be reduced by application of a nanofilm due to the current requirement of inspecting the cameras once per week. Considering the lack of knowledge on the product, and the possible toxicity of its components, it is not recommended that the product is used without further investigations into the type of chemicals used.

40|$|Nanotechnology is {{a rapidly}} growing {{industry}} <b>of</b> global economic <b>importance.</b> <b>The</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> (NPs), that make them useful for industrial applications, have led to concerns regarding their potential impact on human and environmental health. Because of their properties NPs are attractive for basic science, technical or medical applications. Size, surface 22 charge, geometry, and its modifications contribute to NPs toxicity. The aquatic environment is at risk of exposure to NPs, as it acts as a sink for environmental contaminants 1. There are insufficient evidence for environmental concentrations and derived harms for almost all NPs. This finding requires more standardised approaches for NPs hazard identification. The possibility to relate the data obtained in Xenopus laevis with higher vertebrates, including humans, makes it a convincing study model 2, 3. Our aim is to evaluate the activity of three different NPs: AgNPs, AuNPs and SiO 2 NPs, 20 nm sized, on the embryogenesis of X. laevis, These commercial nanoparticles were used as model to understand the possible consequences of similar NPs utilized in medicine. We purchased NPs from MKnano (Canada). Dinamic Light Scattering was performed at 21 °C to measure NPs size and Z-potential. The embryos were reared starting from st 4 / 8 in FETAX containing 0. 01, 1 and 5 mg/L NPs. All embryos were harvested at st 47 / 48. The mortality, morphology, length, heartbeat and pigment distribution were statistically analyzed 4. Real Time-PCR for rax 1, pax 6, sox 9, fgf 8 and egr 2 were carried out from embryos st. 46, see 5. Our data show that all NPs, that we tested, aggregate in FETAX and do not cause mortality. Embryos treated with AuNPs are longer and bradycardic compared with control, whereas those treated with AgNPs or SiO 2 NPs are shorter and tachycardic (AgNPs). The pigment distribution and gene expressions are altered after treatment with SiO 2 NPs. In conclusion our studies indicate that the NPs that we tested affect embryonic development impairing the expression of genes involved in the early embryogenesis. References 1. Casado MP, et al.
