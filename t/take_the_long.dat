25|$|The field H {{is defined}} as the long {{wavelength}} Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of H and not the spins. Once the correlations in H are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in H.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of the {{assessment}} (which takes the form of the cadet performing the role of a street judge with full powers), Kraken killed a group of Democracy terrorists who had taken hostages. Shortly afterwards Judge Morphy, Dredd's best friend and mentor (who had supervised Dredd on his own Final Assessment), was killed on a routine vehicle stop. Furious, Dredd almost murdered one of the perpetrators, pulling back at the last moment when Kraken urged him to control himself. Despite Kraken's impeccable performance, Dredd's unappealable decision was to fail him, believing that [...] "a leopard can't change its spots. Not this one, anyway." [...] At the moment of announcing his verdict, Dredd tendered his resignation and requested permission to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Walk, leaving the city forever.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, {{historian}} Toh Boon Kwan argues {{at length}} {{the cause of}} the Indonesians, asserting that their claim to victory is equally as valid, if not more than that of the British. He states that British policy makers, in their relief at being let out of the spiral towards war, had forgotten that the Lombok Strait was militarily advantageous to Indonesia, as Indonesian warships could screen the task force easily from a nearby naval base. Symbolically, too, the forcing of ships of the vaunted Royal Navy to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> way around their territory can be regarded as a major diplomatic success. Indonesian politicians gained strength from the Crisis, now believing that they could go toe-to-toe with 'Imperialists' and survive [...] "brushes with danger." [...] This, acknowledged Boon Kwan, oddly contrasts with the defeatist views of the army, who were irritated at how close they had come to war, and who in any case carried out the policies of the Confrontation with little relish. It was the army, he asserts, that sent the peace initiatives to the Tunku in September.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{alternative}} is around Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred as the Cape of Good Hope route. This {{was the only}} sea route before the canal was constructed, and when the canal was closed. It is still the only route for ships that are too large for the canal. In the early 21st century, the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to piracy in Somalia, with many shipping companies choosing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> route instead. Between 2008 and 2010, {{it is estimated that}} the canal lost 10% of traffic due to the threat of piracy, and another 10% due to the financial crisis.
