Morrison left in 1995, and the band changed their name to Polarbear. Under this name they released their other EP, Starfighter Pilot, on the Electric Honey label. Drummer Jonny Quinn joined in 1997 and the band signed to Jeepster Records the same year. They then underwent their final name change to Snow Patrol. The band's first two studio albums: Songs for Polarbears and When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up were released in 1998 and 2001 respectively, but failed to do well commercially.

Three different types of low-fat yogurts, YV 0, YV 1, and YV 2, were prepared using Versagel as a fat replacer. The fermentation time of <b>the</b> low-fat <b>yogurts</b> containing Versagel was less than that of <b>the</b> control <b>yogurt</b> (YV 0). <b>The</b> starter cultures maintained their viability (8. 68 to 8. 81 log CFU/g of S. thermophilus and 8. 51 to 8. 81 log CFU/g of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) in all <b>the</b> <b>yogurts</b> throughout <b>the</b> storage period. There was some decrease in the pH of <b>the</b> <b>yogurts</b> during storage and an increase in the concentration of lactic acid. However, the proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory potential of the starter cultures was suppressed in the presence of Versagel.

50|$|Milk fat {{comprises}} about 0.55-6% of <b>the</b> <b>yogurt.</b> Added in quantities {{inversely proportional}} {{to the amount of}} milk solids, the milk fat lends richness to <b>the</b> <b>yogurt.</b> Milk solids account for 8-14% of the yogurt's volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting.

40|$|Dairy Research, 2013 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2013 Within cells, {{cysteine}} can be synthesized from methionine by the enzyme γ-cystathionase. Cysteine is then utilized to synthesize glutathione, which has many functions in cells that contribute to good health. Certain subpopulations, however, especially the elderly, have decreased γ-cystathionase activity. Thus, dietary cysteine may be beneficial in maintaining health. In previous reports, a yogurt with enhanced cysteine content was made by incorporating whey protein isolate (WPI) into the mix’s dairy base combined with a process treatment to minimize cysteine denaturation. The gel quality of this yogurt matched or exceeded that of a yogurt that was formulated and processed to mimic an industrially manufactured product. More importantly, the cysteine content was 3 times greater, and the gel quality was stable throughout a 60 -day shelf life. With this evidence, the question remained whether the flavor of an enhanced cysteine yogurt would be acceptable. Because addition of whey-based products in yogurt {{has been reported to}} affect flavor and texture properties, this study was undertaken to determine consumer liking of a high-cysteine yogurt. Formulas were adjusted to contain sugar and vanillin, and these mixes were processed to produce high-cysteine and low-cysteine yogurts. Yogurts were stored at 4 °C for 1 week, then evaluated by a group of 119 consumers. Consumers rated yogurts based on their liking of appearance, thickness, flavor, aftertaste, and overall acceptability using a 9 -point hedonic scale ranging from dislike extremely (1) to like extremely (9). Overall, consumers rated the high- and low-cysteine yogurts similarly for flavor (6. 1), aftertaste (6. 1), and overall acceptability (6. 3), with mean scores corresponding to “like slightly” to “like moderately. ” Consumers liked the thickness of <b>the</b> high-cysteine <b>yogurt</b> more than <b>the</b> low-cysteine <b>yogurt</b> but liked <b>the</b> appearance of <b>the</b> low-cysteine <b>yogurt</b> more than <b>the</b> high-cysteine <b>yogurt.</b> <b>The</b> high-cysteine <b>yogurt</b> had approximately 3 times more cysteine than <b>the</b> low-cysteine <b>yogurt.</b> These results indicate that a high-cysteine yogurt may be a useful and acceptable food system to provide dietary cysteine...|$|R
