He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea.

5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{not be able}} to hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should {{withdraw}} from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzenegger {{remained}} attached, but Fox {{had mixed}} emotions with Hamm's script. When Columbus dropped out in late 1995 {{to work on}} Jingle All the Way, Fox offered the director's position to Roland Emmerich in January 1996. James Cameron was in talks during the filming of Titanic as writer and producer. Cameron's version would have drawn elements from the original film and its sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes. After the financial and critical success of Titanic, Cameron dropped out. After learning about his previous involvement, Chernin and Rothman met with Peter Jackson to learn about his original Renaissance idea. Jackson turned down directing the film with Schwarzenegger and Cameron as his producer, recognizing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> conflict over the direction. Schwarzenegger left to work on Eraser. Michael Bay then turned down the director's position. Jackson again turned down the project while facing the possible cancellation of The Lord of the Rings in 1998, because he was unenthusiastic following Roddy McDowall's death. In mid-1999, the Hughes brothers were interested in directing but were committed to From Hell.|$|E

500|$|Varina {{and their}} young {{daughter}} Winnie {{were allowed to}} join Davis, and the family was eventually given {{an apartment in the}} officers' quarters. Davis was indicted for treason while imprisoned; one of his attorneys was ex-Governor Thomas Pratt of Maryland. There {{was a great deal of}} discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis, and there was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet to do so. [...] Although Davis wanted such a trial for himself, there were no treason trials against anyone, as it was felt <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not succeed and would impede reconciliation. There was also a concern at the time that such action could result in a judicial decision that would validate the constitutionality of secession (later removed by the Supreme Court ruling in Texas v. White (1869) declaring secession unconstitutional).(2) (2) (3) ...|$|E
500|$|The skull, {{measuring}} [...] in length, was proportionally {{shorter and}} deeper {{than in any}} other large carnivorous dinosaur. The snout was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like Ceratosaurus, and the jaws were curved upwards. As in other abelisaurids, the facial bones, especially the nasal bones, were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes. In life, a wrinkled and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the frontal bones, were thick, cone-shaped but in cross-section somewhat vertically flattened, and measured [...] in length. In life, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns. The proportionally small eyes were situated in {{the upper part of the}} keyhole shaped orbita (eye sockets). The upper part was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of binocular vision.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, McKinsey {{surveyed}} 1,300 US private-sector employers {{on their}} expected {{response to the}} Affordable Care Act (ACA). 30 {{percent of respondents said}} they anticipated <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> or definitely stop offering employer sponsored health coverage after the ACA went into effect in 2014. These results, published in June 2011 in the McKinsey e-Quarterly, [...] became [...] "a useful tool for critics of the ACA and a deep annoyance for defenders of the law" [...] according to an article in TIME Magazine. Supporters of healthcare reform argued the survey far surpassed estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and insisted that McKinsey disclose the survey's methodology. Two weeks after publishing the survey results, McKinsey released the contents of the survey including the questionnaire and 206-pages of survey data. In its accompanying statement, McKinsey said it was intended to capture the attitude of employers at a certain point in time, not make a prediction.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All {{we got in the}} way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{immediately}} began investigating the affair, and by morning, Preston and the eight soldiers had been arrested. In {{a meeting of}} the governor's council held late the morning after the shootings, Boston's selectmen asked Hutchinson to order the removal of troops from the city to Castle William on Castle Island, while a town meeting at Faneuil Hall met to discuss the affair. The governor's council was at first opposed to ordering the troop withdrawal, with Hutchinson correctly claiming {{he did not have the}} authority to order the troops to move. Lieutenant Colonel William Dalrymple, commander of the troops, did not offer to move them. The town meeting, however, became more restive when it learned of this. Under an imminent threat of further violence, the council changed its position, and unanimously ("under duress", according to Hutchinson's report) agreed to request the troops' removal. Secretary of State Andrew Oliver reported that, had the troops not been removed, [...] "that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be destroyed by the people — should it be called rebellion, should it incur the loss of our charter, or be the consequence what it would." [...] This decision left the governor without effective means to police the town. The 14th was transferred to Castle Island without incident about a week later, with the 29th following shortly after. The first four victims were buried amid great ceremony on March 8; Patrick Carr, the fifth and final victim, died on March 14 and was buried with them on March 17.|$|E

2500|$|During the mid-1960s, the United States Army {{initiated}} the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program, {{which led to}} the development of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne for use in the anti-tank gunship role. The US Army pursued the AH-1G HueyCobra as an [...] "interim type" [...] for the [...] "jungle fighting" [...] role. However, the Army's broader concern was the task of protecting Western Europe from the legions of Warsaw Pact armor to the east. The main scenario used by NATO throughout the Cold War was that, if the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact forces were to conduct a massive tank offensive attack on Western Europe, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> cross either the Fulda Gap (capturing Frankfurt first and then aiming for the westward bend of the Rhine south of Wiesbaden: a total distance of just 85miles), or cross the North German Plain (see map).
