5|$|Section D {{believes}} banker Alexis Meynell {{is trying}} to bankrupt the country. Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) asks the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gillian Calderwood (Selina Cadell) to freeze Meynell's assets, but is turned down {{due to lack of}} evidence. To get the evidence they need, Ros is sent undercover to the London Stock Exchange, where Meynell is targeting the bank Highland Life. After starting a rumour about the bank, he starts betting against it. When the chairman of Highland Life, Francis Debham (Simon Williams), attempts to keep the bank afloat, Meynell doubles his position, bankrupting Highland Life. Ros uses the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>swipe</b> a memory card from Meynell's mobile phone, containing his secure email account that could prove his guilt. However, they find nothing relevant. Lucas North (Richard Armitage) relays this to Ros and tells her to get closer to Meynell.|$|E

40|$|A term {{ubiquitous}} in {{the comic book}} industry, swiping has garnered few critical attention in comics theory: yet, the concept is one that strongly shapes the comics world by giving a medium-specific term to its own issues of copying, imitation and borrowing.

2500|$|Prior to September 2007, Boston University had a {{restrictive}} visitor policy, which {{limited the}} ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night.

2500|$|The MetroCard {{system is}} {{susceptible}} to various types of unauthorized resale. At times, this may involve individuals charging <b>to</b> <b>swipe</b> another commuter into the subway system. Usually these frauds involve the person preventing or dissuading the commuter from using {{his or her own}} MetroCard, and then charging the commuter for entry to the system (entry is gained by a method that costs the individual nothing). The individual can use an array of unlimited cards, selling rides for a discounted price. Multiple cards are needed because of the 18-minute delay between each swipe at the same station. Using unlimited cards, one is able to sell rides for a discounted price. In addition, MetroCard Vending Machines are programmed to disable the bill or coin acceptor after a series of rejected bills or coins, which can result in a row of MVMs all saying [...] "No Bills" [...] or [...] "No Coins".|$|E

6000|$|A {{too liberal}} {{interpretation}} {{of the meaning of}} the verb [...] "to hit" [...] led to the departure of two more Riptonians {{in the course of the}} next two overs.

This policy sometimes leads to a boundary or two, as it did on this occasion, but it means that wickets will fall, as also happened now. Seventy-four for three became eighty-six for five.

However, base Avantgarde versions will feature traditional analogue dials with a seven-inch multi-information display, along with an 8.4-inch central infotainment screen. Mercedes-Benz claimed a first for the automotive industry, adding a pair of touch-sensitive control buttons on the steering wheel, which respond <b>to</b> finger <b>swipes</b> <b>to</b> control the car's infotainment system. The more traditional Command controller is also retained on the centre console. The interior was previewed on the Concept IAA (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) that Mercedes showed in September 2015 at the Frankfurt auto show.|$|R
