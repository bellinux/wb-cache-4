40|$|The {{mismatch}} between the services {{offered by the}} two standard <b>transport</b> <b>protocols</b> in the Internet, TCP and UDP, and the services required by distributed multimedia applications {{has led to the}} development of a large number of partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>protocols.</b> That is, protocols which in terms of reliability places themselves between TCP and UDP. This paper presents a taxonomy for retransmission based, partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>protocols,</b> i. e., the subclass of partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>protocols</b> that performs error recovery through retransmissions. The taxonomy comprises two classification schemes: one that classifies retransmission based, partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>protocols</b> with respect to the reliability service they offer and one that classifies them with respect to their error control scheme. The objective of our taxonomy is fourfold: to introduce a unified terminology; to provide a framework in which retransmission based, partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>protocols</b> can be examined, compared, and contrasted; to make explicit the error control schemes used by these protocols; and, finally, to gain new insights into these protocols and thereby suggest avenues for future research.

25|$|This is {{also the}} layer where packets may be {{selected}} to be sent over a virtual private network or other networking tunnel. In this scenario, the link layer data may be considered application data which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a connection, or virtual link, may be established with a <b>transport</b> <b>protocol</b> or even an application scope protocol {{that serves as a}} tunnel in the link layer of the protocol stack. Thus, the TCP/IP model does not dictate a strict hierarchical encapsulation sequence.|$|E
25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a <b>transport</b> <b>protocol,</b> such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data {{directly}} in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E

40|$|Cognitive radio {{networks}} (CRNs) {{have emerged}} as a promising solution to enhance spectrum utilization by using unused or less used spectrum in radio environments. The basic idea of CRNs is to allow secondary users (SUs) access to licensed spectrum, {{under the condition that}} the interference perceived by the primary users (PUs) is minimal. In CRNs, the channel availability is uncertainty due to the existence of PUs, resulting in intermittent communication. Transmission control protocol (TCP) performance may significantly degrade in such conditions. To address the challenges, some <b>transport</b> <b>protocols</b> have been proposed for reliable transmission in CRNs.
