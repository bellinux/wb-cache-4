40|$|Precise {{cable drive}} has been {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gears, belts and pulleys, chains and sprockets in electro-optical tracking system. The analytical method is developed to predict <b>the</b> transmission <b>backlash</b> of precise cable drive to enable designers to better assess the precision performance in the design study phase. Slip angle of precise cable drive is studied, {{and the effect of}} the rotational velocity and inertia of cable on the force equilibrium of contact region is considered. The deformation of cable in slip region and free region is calculated respectively and theoretical formulation of transmission backlash for precise cable drive system is carried out. Parametric sensitivity is investigated to evaluate the relationship between <b>the</b> transmission <b>backlash</b> and precise cable drive parameters including preload tension, load tension, friction coefficient, center distance and output drum radius. Experimental setup is built and <b>the</b> transmission <b>backlash</b> is tested. Effect of preload tension on <b>the</b> transmission <b>backlash</b> is tested. Results show that the experimental value and the theoretical curve of <b>the</b> transmission <b>backlash</b> fit well, which validates the theoretical method developed in this article...|$|R

5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> {{against the}} New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional {{concern over the}} Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} first {{completed}} in 1975 as a live-action/animated film, {{in which only}} the main characters were animated and the rest were portrayed by live actors, but the film's release was pushed back, and later postponed indefinitely. Warner Bros. claimed that {{this version of the}} film was unsatisfactory; concerns about <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> against Coonskin were also cited.|$|E
5|$|Variable-speed drives {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress.

Ruth ultimately chose {{to return home}} to her family. The storyline, which had begun in 2004, was heavily criticised by listeners, who inundated the BBC with complaints. Low listener figures were also attributed to the storyline, while the editor Vanessa Whitburn said <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> helped keep Ruth faithful to David.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. <b>The</b> <b>backlash</b> was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

50|$|In a gear train, {{backlash}} is cumulative. When a gear-train {{is reversed}} the driving gear is turned a short distance, {{equal to the}} total of all <b>the</b> <b>backlashes,</b> before <b>the</b> final driven gear begins to rotate. At low power outputs, backlash results in inaccurate calculation from the small errors introduced at each change of direction; at large power outputs backlash sends shocks through the whole system and can damage teeth and other components.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|Risk is {{the eighth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on August 31, 1999 by Capitol Records, the band's last album {{to be released}} by the label. The first Megadeth album since 1990 to feature a lineup change, Risk marks the studio debut of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso with the band, {{as well as the}} final appearance of longtime guitarist Marty Friedman, who announced his departure a year later. Meant to be a breakthrough on alternative rock radio, Risk received a mixed response because of the great deviation from the band's traditional sound. <b>The</b> <b>backlash</b> ultimately resulted with the band returning towards a heavier sound with its next album.|$|E
5|$|Saint Anselm {{came out}} of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s with no major {{disturbances}} or riots on campus despite various bomb threats called into campus, often from parties outside the college. Fr. Placidus Riley, O.S.B. successfully led the college through these challenging times. Despite <b>the</b> <b>backlash</b> against the U.S. military on college campuses nationwide, the presence of a National Guard armory did not result in any major problems. However, in May 1970, final exams for that year were made optional as students showed support for the students of Kent State after the massacre of several unarmed college students protesting the Vietnam War. Students, faculty and members of the monastic community held prayer services and rallies throughout campus after the shootings.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>backlash</b> {{against the}} socialist Second Republic {{brought about the}} {{democratic}} Third Republic under consecutive presidents Albert Zafy (1991), Ratsiraka (1997) and Marc Ravalomanana (2001), followed by a Fourth Republic under Andry Rajoelina, who {{came to power in}} a 2009 coup d'état. Although Dama performed at political rallies in Paris during the eight-month political standoff following the 2001 presidential elections that brought Ravalomanana to power, Mahaleo as a full group has never sided with any particular politician, instead expressing through their lyrics the social and political views and concerns of the average Malagasy citizen. They tend to promote collective, grassroots action as the best solution to the country's problems, rather than entrusting the work to politicians and international development partners.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. <b>The</b> <b>backlash</b> against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, Hall {{continued}} her alliance with Melina, both teaming with her and accompanying her to the ring on numerous occasions.

In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with multiple partners, including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to face them in tag team matches. She continued to have a rivalry with Kelly throughout October, and was {{also a part of}} the winning team in a Raw versus SmackDown 10-wrestler tag team elimination match at Survivor Series in November, although she was eliminated by Maria.|$|E

5000|$|The Ghostwalker {{series has}} groups of men (and a few women), called Ghostwalkers who go on special missions.
