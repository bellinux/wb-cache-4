Bomelius diverted this outcome by announcing {{in a letter}} to Parker that he had knowledge of a terrible danger hanging over England. The archbishop sent the letter to Cecil and urged him to examine Bomelius in the privy council. But Cecil entered into private correspondence with the doctor in the expectation of discovering a conspiracy. What Bomelius communicated to Cecil was a statement on the queen's nativity, and a portion of a book De Utilitate Astrologiæ, in which he claimed that great revolutions take place every 500 years, and that as rather more than 500 years had elapsed since the Norman conquest, England must be in imminent peril. Cecil treated Bomelius's announcements as worthless.|$|R

The results suggest a bicausal relationship between notes and bonds and a unicausal relationship <b>from</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> municipals. Shocks {{in the bond}} market have a large impact on the municipal and note markets, whereas shocks in the municipal or note markets have a smaller impact on the bond market.

40|$|This paper shows empirically {{that the}} level of stock-bond {{correlation}} depends more on crosscountry influences than on stock and bond market interaction. The study examines the relation of cross-country and cross-asset stock and bond market linkages for eight developed countries and finds that (i) stock market returns primarily depend on the US stock market and (ii) bond market returns primarily depend on the US bond market. Recursive Granger causality tests further show that the dominance of the US stock and bond market has increased in recent years and that there is both Granger causality <b>from</b> stocks <b>to</b> <b>bonds</b> and <b>from</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> stocks in several periods. We argue that the relatively low level of stock-bond correlations is due to an increased cross-country interdependence of financial markets leading to more frequent portfolio reallocations between stocks and <b>bonds</b> in order <b>to</b> compensate for lower cross-country diversification benefits. financial market integration, stock market co-movements, bond market co-movements, stock-bond linkages, flight-to-quality, contagion...|$|R

Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common <b>to</b> prevent snow <b>from</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows.
