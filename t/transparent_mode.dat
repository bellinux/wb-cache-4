50|$|The XBees {{can operate}} {{either in a}} {{transparent}} data mode or in a packet-based application programming interface (API) mode. In the <b>transparent</b> <b>mode,</b> data coming into the Data IN (DIN) pin is directly transmitted over-the-air to the intended receiving radios without any modification. Incoming packets can either be directly addressed to one target (point-to-point) or broadcast to multiple targets (star). This mode is primarily used in instances where an existing protocol cannot tolerate changes to the data format. AT commands are used to control the radio’s settings. In API mode the data are wrapped in a packet structure that allows for addressing, parameter setting and packet delivery feedback, including remote sensing and control of digital I/O and analog input pins.|$|E

The technology employs a small jolt of electricity to switch the material between NIR-transmitting and NIR-blocking states.

The same window can also be switched to a dark mode, blocking both light and heat, or to a bright, fully <b>transparent</b> <b>mode.</b> The effect relies on a synergistic interaction in the region where glassy matrix meets nanocrystal that increases the electrochromic effect. The atoms connect across the nanocrystal-glass interface, causing a structural rearrangement in the glass matrix. The interaction creates space inside the glass, allowing charge to move more readily.|$|E

Companies involved in global sourcing are confronted with the task both to bring local production schemes in line with competitive strategies and market demands and to guarantee food safety and food quality. Likewise, sustainability and social responsibility imply new strategic challenges for global food chains.

The study focuses on the gain in throughput that is possible in omnidirectional relay systems and increases in signalling requirements that arise due to the multihop network architecture. The study finds that the introduction of <b>transparent</b> <b>mode</b> relays cannot deliver improved throughput for a substantial part of the coverage area of a Base Station (BS) – only approximately half of the total area covered by the BS can benefit from throughput enhancement. Further, the study shows that 802. 16 j based systems require significant signalling overhead, with almost twice that of 802. 16 e in the cases studied. Finally, the study demonstrates that in a topology with users uniformly distributed within the BS cell coverage, the maximum throughput increase on the downlink that can be achieved is relatively low. Much further work is necessary to realise useful gains from these systems. Keywords- 802. 16 j MMR, transparent multihop relay, performance, omnidirectional antenna. I...|$|E

Un-der the <b>transparent</b> <b>mode,</b> existing studies aim at improving network throughput by increasing the transmission rates of mobile stations (MSs).

Objective 1 is necessary while objective 2 should be achieved when objective 1 is met. The above bi-objective problem is especially important when the network is non-saturated. The EURA problem is NP-hard and we propose a heuristic with two key designs. First, we exploit relay sta-tions to allow more concurrent uplink transmissions to fully use the frame space. Second, we reduce MSs ’ transmission powers by adjusting their rates and paths. Simulation re-sults show that our heuristic can save up to 80 % of MSs’ energy as compared with existing work...|$|E
