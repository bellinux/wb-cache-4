500|$|Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud}} of his players despite their defeat: [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> win today but the players have done the club proud, I think today we were playing against a top team and I think we have got a lot to be proud of." [...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E
500|$|Scheduling {{the concert}} meant a {{financial}} loss of £500,000 for the band, despite sponsorship from Coca-Cola and GSM. Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 ( [...] , [...] ), {{because of the}} 50percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we {{felt it was important}} that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. <b>To</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> not do the whole show would have been rude." [...] According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation.|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> <b>And</b> I feel very grateful.... For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and {{near the end of the}} performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E

She said: [...] "It means {{a great deal}} to me, it's a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year. <b>To</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> receive this and to meet the Queen {{at the end of it}} just {{finishes}} it off perfectly." ...|$|E

And yet we still invite them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> at the same time ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights. [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's take on {{bringing}} in Budig as Greenlee hinged on her {{belief that it}} was a no-brainer. Wilson had been trying to get Budig at All My Children for years. [...] "She went on to Guiding Light about two weeks before I was going to bring her in to read for the part," [...] stated Wilson. [...] "Since then I'd spoken to her several times and tried to encourage her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> this time we got lucky. I think she's a terrific young lady and a wonderful actress, and I'm really happy that we have her here at ABC." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having played what is {{generally}} considered their debut first-class match against Lancashire in 1882, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status following the 1885 season, after a string of heavy losses and matches {{in which they could}} not field eleven men. [...] Meetings were held at Somerset, and Henry Murray-Anderdon took over as secretary of the club. [...] Under his leadership, the club acquired a ground in Taunton, variously known as the 'Athletic Ground' and 'Rack Field'. [...] The land was extensively worked on until Murray-Anderdon announced that [...] "opponents will want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> play". [...] In addition to improving the ground, the secretary targeted the universities to add talent to the team, and added two professional bowlers, George Nichols and Ted Tyler.|$|E
2500|$|... t.A.T.u.'s first {{rehearsal}} dominated proceedings on 20 May—the band {{were supposed}} to rehearse the day before, but had turned up a day late, claiming that Julia Volkova was suffering from a sore throat. The group were booed by journalists during their press conference where they complained about the production's poor lighting and stage. EBU supervisor Sarah Yuen said [...] "They are the bad girls of pop… we shouldn’t have expected them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> be nice and pleasant." [...] The EBU had originally planned to have a pre-recorded performance of the Russian entry ready to substitute during the live broadcast in case the duo performed a lesbian publicity stunt on stage, which they deemed inappropriate for a family entertainment show. The EBU later stated that the performance would be broadcast live without any interruption.|$|E

2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|The Beach Boys' surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. Wilson once said of its myth: [...] "It's not just the surfing; it's the outdoors and cars and sunshine; it's the society of California; it's the way of California." [...] Al Jardine of the Beach Boys argued that [...] "It’s not entirely a myth. There are still some elements that are certainly true, especially for a first-time observer. But to be able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> to drive that coast on Route 1 ... you experience {{the water and the}} animals and the sea life, the whole thing. It’s really magical. It really is." [...] Capitol Records staff producer Nick Venet, who worked with the group early on, believed that Hollywood films was where most of the group's lyrical inspiration was drawn.|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, 2014, Jerad and Amanda Miller {{killed two}} Las Vegas police {{officers}} and a civilian before Amanda Miller took her life. Jerad Miller was fatally wounded and died during a shootout with police. During the attacks, they shouted [...] "this is a revolution", and they covered {{the bodies of the}} officers in a Gadsden flag and left a copy of a manifesto bearing a swastika. Their original plan may have been to take over a courthouse and execute public officials. The Millers had moved from Indiana to the Las Vegas area in January. They were quoted on Reno television KRNV: [...] "I feel sorry for any federal agents that want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> try to push around or anything like that. I really don't want violence toward them but if they're gonna come and bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it." [...] Miller commented on the issues involved in greater length in social media, and interviewed other protesters at the Bundy ranch.|$|E
