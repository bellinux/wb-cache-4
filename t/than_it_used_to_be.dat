Such chemicals, known as pesticides, have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year. Other poisons {{can also be used to}} preserve foods and building material.|$|E

However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

Today, the body of water is less productive <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> because of runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species.|$|E

25|$|Under {{all three}} of the {{conceptual}} approaches to animal cruelty discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty. Due to changes in ethical standards, this type of cruelty tends to be less common today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover, and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travellers on the Grand Tour.|$|E
25|$|Dog meat is {{far less}} popular today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> being viewed largely {{as a kind of}} health tonic rather than as a diet staple, {{especially}} amongst the younger generations who view dogs as pets and service animals. That said, historically the consumption of dog meat {{can be traced back to}} antiquity. Dog bones were excavated in a neolithic settlement in Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. A wall painting in the Goguryeo tombs complex in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site which dates from 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse.|$|E
25|$|Russia's oldest factory {{was founded}} by Peter the Great in 1721 first as a {{lapidary}} plant {{to help in the}} construction of the Peterhof Palaces but also other Palaces in St.Petersburg. It started to produce equipment and parts for the watch industry in the 1920s. After World War II, the factory started to produce complete watches under the brand name Pobeda and from 1961 under the brand Raketa. in 1985 the factory had 7500 employees and was producing 5 million mechanical watches per year. Today, it is the last watch factory in Russia producing its own movements from A to Z, though the production is much smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E
25|$|After the riot, Trench {{recognised}} {{the necessity}} to implement further reform of the government. So, with the assistance from Holmes, the government began a City District Officer Scheme in May 1968 {{which was based on}} the existing District Officer system in the New Territories. Under the new scheme, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were divided into 10 different districts. Each district had a District Office where the District Officer concerned could collect public opinions, receive complaints and provide advice and quick responses. This scheme effectively drew the relationship {{between the government and the}} general public closer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> as the general public could easily express their needs and demands to the District Officer nearby. Alongside the reform, the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs was reorganised into the Home Affairs Department in February 1969 while the post of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs was renamed into the Secretary for Home Affairs. Holmes continued to serve after the reorganisation and was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the same year. Before retiring from the Home Affairs Department, he had been focusing on the legislation on abolishing polygyny. Yet, such legislation was completed in October 1971, five months after his retirement from the civil service.|$|E

500|$|Bridge Street Bridge (Chantry Bridge) is a {{single-span}} metal {{bridge that}} carries Bridge Street over the navigation. [...] The street continues eastwards and originally crossed {{the river at}} Rotherham Bridge. [...] As originally constructed in 1483 the bridge had four arches and was [...] wide, but it was widened and a fifth arch added in 1768. In 1930 a new bridge was built nearby, a little further upstream, {{and as part of}} the work, the fifth arch was removed and the bridge was returned to its Medieval width. Because of improvements to the river made in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is wider <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and the bridge no longer reaches the west bank. [...] The chapel on the bridge is one of only three complete bridge chapels that still exist in Britain, the other two being at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and St Ives, Huntingdonshire. Dating from about 1483, it remained in use as a chapel until the reign of King Edward VI (1547–1553). It was put to use as almshouses during the 17th and 18th centuries, and in 1779 it was used as a prison. Later, it became a private dwelling and finally a tobacconist's shop, before being returned to its original use as a chapel; it was formally reconsecrated in 1924 by the Bishop of Sheffield.|$|E
500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Marriages between Swedish- and Finnish-speakers are {{nowadays}} very common. According {{to a study}} {{commissioned by}} the Swedish Assembly of Finland in 2005, 48.5% of all families with children where {{at least one of}} the parents was Swedish-speaking were bilingual in the sense of one parent being Swedish- and the other Finnish-speaking (only families living in those municipalities where Swedish was at least a co-official language were included in this study). 67.7% of the children from these bilingual families were registered as Swedish-speaking. The proportion of those who attended schools where Swedish was the language of instruction was even higher. [...] The Finnish authorities classify a person as a Swedish- or Finnish-speaker based only upon that person's (or parent's) own choice, which can be changed at any time.

2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
