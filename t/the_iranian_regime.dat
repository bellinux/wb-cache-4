The White House spokesman said that the comments underline the need to “keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons”.

On June 16, 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing killed 19 U.S. soldiers. The 9/11 Commission concluded that Hezbollah, likely {{with the support of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>regime,</b> was the perpetrator of that bombing in Saudi Arabia. It said there are “signs” that Al-Qaeda also played a role.|$|E
25|$|The wave of copycat {{incidents}} reached Europe on 11 February 2011, {{in a case}} {{very similar}} to Bouazizi's. Noureddine Adnane, a 27-year-old Moroccan street vendor, set himself on fire in Palermo, Sicily, in protest of the confiscation of his wares and the harassment that was allegedly inflicted on him by municipal officials. He died five days later. In Amsterdam, Kambiz Roustay, a 36-year-old asylum seeker from Iran, set himself on fire on Dam Square in protest of being rejected asylum.

The MEK advocates the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>regime</b> and its replacement with the group’s own leadership.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>regime.</b> It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{prominent}} Palestinians rejoiced at the news, {{believing it}} would give them increased legitimacy and Israel decreased credibility {{in the international arena}} and among its own allies. Similarly, Thomas Friedman observed: [...] "From Iran’s point of view, it makes fantastic TV on Al Jazeera, and all the European networks; it undermines Israel’s legitimacy with the young generation on college campuses around the globe; and it keeps the whole world much more focused on Israeli civil rights abuses against Palestinians rather than the massive civil rights abuses perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>regime</b> against its own people.

2500|$|President George W. Bush {{insisted on}} 31 August 2006, that [...] "there must be consequences" [...] for Iran's {{defiance}} of demands that it stop enriching uranium.

Iran, in particular, provides little economic opportunity for women which has resulted in limited participation in the formal economy. In 1986, for example, 11 million women were not counted in the labor force because <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>regime</b> deemed them to be [...] "homemakers."

Later, in [...] "Islamic Awakening conferences" [...] which were held in Tehran, Khamenei praised the Muslim youths of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain for {{what he described as}} Islamic awakening. He also paralleled these events with Islamic revolution in Iran during his Nowruz oration in 2011.
