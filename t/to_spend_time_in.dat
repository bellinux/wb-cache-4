25|$|During {{the course}} of the 2001 {{campaign}} a conflict arose between Rossy and the opposition candidate, then-mayor of Antananarivo Marc Ravalomanana, which manifested in such indirect ways as the ostracism of Rossy's bodyguards by influential Ravalomanana supporters. Rossy chose <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> France to allow the political standoff to run its course. When Ravalomanana was ultimately declared the winner of the election, Rossy anticipated a further deterioration in his relations with the new political, social and economic leaders of the capital, and made the decision to remain with his family in France until the situation improved. He was to remain six years in France without returning home to Madagascar. Minister of Culture Patrick Ramiaramanana (2007–08) attempted to prohibit Rossy from holding concerts in Madagascar. Despite the friction between Rossy and Ravalomanana, Ramiaramanana's efforts were condemned by the president, who relieved the minister of his post.|$|E
25|$|Generally very lethargic, a trait {{which helps}} it survive {{months at a}} time without food, the {{saltwater}} crocodile will usually loiter in the water or bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated that they are more active and more likely <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the water during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter. Saltwater crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians, spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much less terrestrial than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on land except for basking. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in search of land and in some cases, barnacles have been observed growing on crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.|$|E

25|$|In early 1964 Clark {{made his}} first visit to the Antipodes as he spent time as the William Evans Professor at Otago University in New Zealand, using the {{opportunity}} to learn more about Maori prehistory. In May of that year he used the Commonwealth Visiting Scholars' appointment to fund a period in Australia, where he spent time at the University of Sydney, Queensland Museum, and the Australian Museum. He also visited Vincent Megaw's excavation of the Curracurrang rock shelter and was taken by Norman Tindale to witness a living hunter-gatherer society at the Papunya indigenous community. In November 1965, he undertook a lecture tour of the U.S., giving talks at Pennsylvania State University, Temple University, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado, and Colorado Women's College. That year Hutchinson published a book that Clark had co-written with Piggott, Prehistoric Societies, and in 1967 Thames and Hudson published Clark's coffee table book, The Stone Age Hunters. In 1968 he published a revised second edition of World Prehistory, although it attracted criticism from archaeologists studying Africa for making significant errors about that continent. In 1968 he travelled via Moscow to Japan in order to attend the International Conference of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, using the trip <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan, the Philippines, and New Zealand.

With Richard's volunteering his time as legal counsel, they refused to pay fines, {{and the two men}} spent a month in prison. The punishment was never ordered for Pankhurst, however, possibly because the magistrate feared public backlash against the imprisonment of a woman so respected in the community.
