5|$|The term Palestine is also {{sometimes}} {{used in a}} limited sense {{to refer to the}} parts of the Palestinian territories currently under the administrative control of the Palestinian National Authority, a quasi-governmental entity which governs parts of the State of Palestine under the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jurisdiction {{over the}} city was {{handed over to the}} Palestinian National Authority on December 12, 1995, as a result of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> Interim Agreement on the West Bank. Nablus is {{surrounded}} by Israeli settlements and was site of regular clashes with the IDF during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{married his}} cousin Intissar al-Wazir in 1962 and had five {{children}} with her. They had three sons, named Jihad, Bassem and Nidal, and two daughters, named Iman and Hanan al-Wazir. Intissar {{and her children}} returned to Gaza following <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> between Israel and the PLO and in 1996 {{she became the first}} female minister in the Palestinian National Authority. His son Jihad al-Wazir is currently the Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} years, Esquipulas {{laid the}} groundwork for <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accord</b> (not to be confused with <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> between <b>the</b> Israeli government and the PLO). This was a preliminary agreement between the Guatemalan National Reconciliation Commission (CNR) and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) which brought to an end more than three decades of strife in Guatemala.|$|R

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> II <b>Accord,</b> <b>the</b> Paris Protocol is {{incorporated}} in Article XXIV. The amendments to the Protocol (Supplement to the Protocol on Economic Relations) were annexed as Annex V of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> II <b>Accord</b> and contain only some changes on the clearance of revenues and some technical changes on the taxes issue. While the Protocol initially applied to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area, its jurisdiction was extended {{to all of the}} Palestinian Territories in <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> II <b>Accord.</b>|$|R
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|When the First Intifada {{broke out}} in 1987, Deir al-Balah's {{residents}} participated in the uprising against Israeli rule. Around 30 residents were killed during the uprising, which formally ended in 1993 with <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel. In 1994 Deir al-Balah was the first city to officially come {{under the control of}} the Palestinian National Authority as a result of the Gaza–Jericho Agreement.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1988 and {{continuing}} {{for the following}} years, the NRC and URNG met on several occasions and engaged in peace talks, but {{did not come to}} an end to the Guatemalan civil war.

5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b> The {{agreement}} called for Palestinian {{administration of the}} Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994.

The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|Said disliked <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords,</b> thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} community regards {{all of the}} Palestinian territories including Gaza as occupied. Human Rights Watch has declared at the UN Human Rights Council that it views Israel as a de facto occupying power in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel has no military or other presence, because <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accord</b> authorizes Israel to control the airspace and the territorial sea.|$|R
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b> Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E

25|$|Peres {{was perhaps}} more closely {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> than any other Israeli politician (Rabin included) {{with the possible exception}} of his own protégé, Yossi Beilin.
