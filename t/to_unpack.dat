25|$|While each playwright {{will take}} {{his or her}} own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who {{undertook}} and completed this task for Timon of Athens felt that the trick was to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere <b>to</b> <b>unpack</b> whatever might hinder the free flow of the story {{in a way that is}} clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his article}} in The American Interest, Francis Fukuyama criticized Acemoglu and Robinson's {{approach}} and argument for being {{very similar to}} a book by North, Wallis and Weingast in 2009, Violence and Social Order. Fukuyama argued that the conception of states being inclusive or extractive [...] oversimplifies the problem. He {{also pointed out that}} the approach is too conceptual and fails <b>to</b> <b>unpack</b> the practical meaning of different institutions. The historical approach to prove the argument was also subjected to interpretation. Finally, Fukuyama specifically pointed out that the argument by Acemoglu and Robinson does not apply to the case of modern China, as China has extractive institutions but still flourishes economically.|$|E

2500|$|Dourish’s {{recent work}} {{has dealt with}} {{information}} technology use in trans-national and trans-cultural contexts. For example, his work on postcolonial computing has tried <b>to</b> <b>unpack</b> how assumptions about technology and knowledge drawn from Western or industrialized nation experiences create shape (or misshape) technology design. In the process, he has worked with indigenous Australian people, Chinese gamers, mobility between Thailand and the USA, and Indian people regarding IT design. Dourish and his team were drawn by these new settings to dismiss the presumption that [...] "everyone is or wants {{to be just like}} us". The new experience also helped to challenge current technological practices by showing the assumptions made in familiar settings.|$|E
2500|$|In Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book The Edge of Reality, Hynek {{published}} a stereoscopic {{photograph of a}} UFO he took during a flight.

UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book Psychic Vibrations that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he later told a reporter for The Globe and Mail {{that he had never}} seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek [...] "has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO even if I did see one—not without a witness'".|$|E

Stein, Director of the Institute for the Study of Modern Israel of Emory University, who was {{the founder of the}} Middle East program at the Carter Center and the Center's first director (February 1984 – 1986), presents criticisms of the book as follows: [...] "President Carter's book on the Middle East, a title too inflammatory to even print, is not based on unvarnished analysis; it is replete with factual errors, copied materials not cited, superficialities, glaring omissions, and simply invented segments." [...] In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: [...] "Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third person in the room, and my notes of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book." [...] He adds: [...] "Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or <b>to</b> <b>unpack</b> it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook. Having little access to Arabic and Hebrew sources, I believe, clearly handicapped his understanding and analyses of how history has unfolded over the last decade." [...] At {{the end of the first}} week of December, Karen DeYoung reported that Stein had not yet provided a full outline of such alleged factual errors in the book.|$|E
50|$|Silent {{mutations}} {{alter the}} secondary structure of mRNA. mRNA has a secondary structure {{that is not}} necessarily linear like that of DNA, thus the shape that accompanies complementary bonding in the structure can have significant effects. For example, if the mRNA molecule is relatively unstable, then it can be rapidly degraded by enzymes in the cytoplasm. If the RNA molecule is highly stable, and the complementary bonds are strong and resistant <b>to</b> <b>unpacking</b> prior <b>to</b> translation, then the gene may be underexpressed.

2500|$|Baber Siddiqui (Manoj Sood)– A {{divorced}} college {{economics professor}} {{and the most}} conservative member of the Muslim community in Mercy, he acted as the imam prior to Amaar's arrival in the pilot episode; when Amaar briefly quits his job in Season 3, Baber again takes over as imam, and proves {{to be one of}} the reasons the community is so determined to get Amaar back. His conservatism often conflicts with the wishes of his teenage daughter Layla, although he loves her dearly (in fact the main reason he has custody of her is that when his ex-wife came to visit him after he moved to Mercy she saw that the only thing he had bothered <b>to</b> <b>unpack</b> was his daughter's picture on the wall). He wears a taqiyah and a shalwar kameez and constantly rants and raves and complains about everything, to the point that most of his acquaintances consider him obnoxious. He once falsely claimed that he was on the American no-fly list to cover up his own fear of flying, resulting in Rayyan and Amaar taking him to the American consulate in Regina three separate times to help him clear his name. He calls most non-Muslims [...] "imbeciles" [...] and [...] "infidels", although it is rather obvious that he is not any sort of dangerous fanatic but just a harmless crank. In the episode [...] "The Letter", Baber takes an interest in a female motivational speaker (played by Andrea Martin) who is stranded in Mercy, who in turn becomes interested in him. Everything goes well until Baber utters some anti-Semitic remarks. [...] The motivational speaker takes offense, and reveals to Baber that she is Jewish. Baber comes to Amaar for guidance. Amaar reminds him that anti-Semitism is not tolerated in the Muslim faith. [...] Baber also falls for Thorne's ploy of taking over as Imam which led to Amaar being removed as Imam. [...] His bringing in the overzealous Rahaloon resulted in the mosque being removed from the church. [...] Later Amaar made amends with Baber when he was reinstated as Imam. [...] Baber performed Amaar and Rayyan's wedding and they left for their honeymoon. [...] Upon their return it is revealed that Baber is the current Imam and is good friends with Reverend Thorne.|$|E

The London show, A Survey of the Avant-Garde in Britain, included Ian Breakwell, Victor Burgin, Anthony McCall and John Stezaker.

50|$|In a {{study of}} folic acid {{functionalized}} PAMAM, methotrexate was combined either as an inclusion complex within the dendrimer or as a covalent surface attachment.

The surface attachment approach yielded stable, soluble complexes which were able to selectively target cancer cells and did not prematurely release their cargo. Drug release {{in the case of the}} inclusion complex could be explained by the protonation of surface and interior amines under biological conditions, leading <b>to</b> <b>unpacking</b> of the dendrimer conformation and consequent release of the inner cargo.
