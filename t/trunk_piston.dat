50|$|This <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> design {{would become}} almost {{universal}} for internal combustion engines.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication of the {{crosshead}} has {{advantages over}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> as their lubricating oil {{is not subject}} to the heat of combustion: the oil is not contaminated by combustion soot particles, it does not break down owing to the heat and a thinner, less viscous oil may be used. The friction of both piston and crosshead may be only half of that for a <b>trunk</b> <b>piston.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some large slow-speed Diesel engines, {{particularly}} those for ships, use crossheads and piston rods. Medium- and high-speed diesel engines operate at faster speeds and so use lighter-weight <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} of most <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons,</b> particularly for diesel engines, {{is that they}} have a groove for an oil ring below the gudgeon pin, in addition to the rings between the gudgeon pin and crown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trunk</b> <b>pistons</b> {{have been}} a common design of piston {{since the early days}} of the {{reciprocating}} internal combustion engine. They were used for both petrol and diesel engines, although high speed engines have now adopted the lighter weight slipper piston.|$|R
50|$|Princess of Vancouver pioneered {{a series}} of diesel engine {{innovations}} that made possible the use of heavy fuel oil in medium speed <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> engines.|$|E
50|$|Wichmann {{launched}} the WX28 engine in 1984. This 2-stroke loop-scavenged <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> engine had cylinders with a 280 mm bore and 360 mm stoke. Each cylinder generated 295 kW {{and the engine}} was produced in 4, 5 and 6 in-line and V8, V10, V12 and V16 models, giving a choice of power from 1180 to 4735 kW.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} (piston) engines {{operate at}} higher speeds than steam engines. They thus benefit from reduced reciprocating mass {{and from a}} shorter, stiffer linkage between the piston and the connecting rod. Double-acting engines are also very rare, although these did use piston rods. The high-speed steam engine's lightweight <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> was thus soon adopted and remains in service today. Its major changes have been in its sealing rings and the adoption of aluminium alloys to make the pistons lighter.|$|E
50|$|Some late steam engines, mostly {{high-speed}} steam engines, {{were also}} single acting. These also used <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons,</b> {{but in a}} new form. These engines were vertical and used a simple piston design, with no separate trunk but using the sides of an elongated piston as the crosshead bearing surface.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trunk</b> <b>pistons</b> {{are long}} {{relative}} to their diameter. They act both as a piston and cylindrical crosshead. As the connecting rod is angled for much of its rotation, {{there is also a}} side force that reacts {{along the side of the}} piston against the cylinder wall. A longer piston helps to support this.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines, and {{in particular}} all current automobile engines, do not generally have piston rods. Instead they use <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons,</b> where the piston and crosshead are combined and so do not need a rod between them. The term piston rod {{has been used as}} a synonym for 'connecting rod' in the context of these engines.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines soon switched to single-acting cylinders. This was for two reasons: {{as for the}} high-speed steam engine, the high force on each piston and its connecting rod {{was so great that}} it placed large demands upon the bearings. A single-acting piston, where the direction of the forces was consistently compressive along the connecting rod, allowed for tighter bearing clearances. Secondly the need for large valve areas to provide good gas flow, whilst requiring a small volume for the combustion chamber so as to provide good compression, monopolised the space available in the cylinder head. Lenoir's steam engine-derived cylinder was inadequate for the petrol engine and so a new design, based around poppet valves and a single-acting <b>trunk</b> <b>piston</b> appeared instead.|$|E
50|$|As speeds increased, the {{high-speed}} engine evolved towards its developed {{form of the}} multi-cylinder vertical engine with an enclosed crankcase. There was also a tendency to use single-acting pistons. This had two advantages, the lubrication {{could be provided by}} a generous 'splash' system within the crankcase that also helped with cooling, and secondly that the forces in a single-acting engine always act in the same way, as a compression force along the piston rod and connecting rod. This meant that even if a bearing's clearances were relatively slack, the bearing was always held tight. Slack, and thus free-running, bearings could be accepted. An example of such an engine would be the twin-cylinder Westinghouse engines. These engines used a <b>trunk</b> <b>piston,</b> as used for internal combustion engines today, where there is no separate crosshead and the gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is moved up within the piston itself. This provides a very compact layout, but obviously requires a single-acting piston. Interestingly, the main crankshaft bearings of this engine were provided with separate oilers that drained into the crankcase sump. It was recognised that the crankcase oil would become contaminated with water from condensed steam and blow-by from the pistons. A valve was provided for draining this collected condensate off from beneath the oil {{in the bottom of the}} deep sump.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Henry J. Kaiser asked William Besler to convert his 1953 Kaiser Manhattan to steam. Besler {{completed}} this in either 1957 or 1958. The engine {{was described as}} a V4 single acting uniflow with <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons.</b> It was a cross compound with piston valves across the high-pressure heads. Kaiser apparently did not take the car back and left it with Besler.|$|R
50|$|Their <b>pistons</b> {{are usually}} <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons,</b> where the gudgeon pin joint of the {{connecting}} rod {{is within the}} piston itself. This avoids the crosshead, piston rod and its sealing gland, but it also makes a single-acting piston almost essential. This, in turn, {{has the advantage of}} allowing easy access {{to the bottom of the}} piston for lubricating oil, which also has an important cooling function. This avoids local overheating of the piston and rings.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{force is}} {{transmitted}} from the opposed <b>trunk</b> style <b>pistons</b> to either an upper or lower crankshaft. The two crank shafts are geared together by a vertical drive shaft. Pistons are removed by either removing the top crankshaft, and removing from the top, or by removing through the lower crank case access doors.|$|R
50|$|In the Willans engine, {{cushioning}} {{at the end}} {{of stroke}} was provided by an additional air cylinder below the others. The air piston also acted as a trunk guide. During the upward stroke, inertia of the engine continues its movement upwards and before the next stroke begins there is otherwise nothing to retard it. The enclosed air cylinder acts as a compressed air dashpot above the <b>trunk</b> guide <b>piston.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first multiple-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to demonstrate}} {{some of the}} principles of the steam motor was the Midland Railway's Paget locomotive of 1907. This was one of many attempts to build a balanced locomotive, so avoiding the problems of hammer blow. It also followed contemporary advanced stationary engine practice in using single-acting cylinders. The locomotive has been variously described as either inspired by, or actually using, the design of the Willans engine that represented the peak of steam engine design at this time. In fact, the rotary valves used for the locomotive were entirely different from the Willans' characteristic central valve spindle, even though they did both use single-acting <b>trunk</b> <b>pistons.</b> Eight cylinders were used, two driving the front axle of the three driving axles, four the middle axle and two the rear axle. All three axles were coupled by external coupling rods. The central axle was a complicated forging as a four-throw internal crank axle, although following traditional Stephenson practice. To provide additional space for the cylinders, the locomotive was outside framed.|$|R
50|$|The name 'trunk piston' {{derives from}} the 'trunk engine', an early design of marine steam engine. To make these more compact, they avoided the steam engine's usual piston rod with {{separate}} crosshead and were instead the first engine design to place the gudgeon pin directly within the <b>piston.</b> Otherwise these <b>trunk</b> engine <b>pistons</b> bore {{little resemblance to the}} trunk piston; they were extremely large diameter and double-acting. Their 'trunk' was a narrow cylinder mounted in the centre of the piston.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{engines are}} usually {{double-acting}} (i.e. steam pressure acts alternately {{on each side}} of the piston) and the admission and release of steam is controlled by slide valves, piston valves or poppet valves. Consequently, steam engine pistons are nearly always comparatively thin discs: their diameter is several times their thickness. (One exception is the <b>trunk</b> engine <b>piston,</b> shaped more like those in a modern internal-combustion engine.) Another factor is that since almost all steam engines use crossheads to translate the force to the drive rod, there are few lateral forces acting to try and [...] "rock" [...] the piston, so a cylinder-shaped piston skirt isn't necessary.|$|R
