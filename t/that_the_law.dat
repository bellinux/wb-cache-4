5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> does not impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated {{is that of a}} minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E

Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality instead of using online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E

40|$|By the ‘Rule of Law’ I mean a set {{of formal}} and {{institutional}} features <b>the</b> <b>law</b> may possess in varying degrees. These features define an ideal, which laws have traditionally been expected to live up to. One of these features is publicity. Part of what constitutes <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> is <b>the</b> requirement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> should be public. This {{is the subject of}} this paper. When it is claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> requires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> should be public, what is to be understood by this claim? My main claim is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> requirement of publicity is best understood in terms of the notion of common, or mutual, knowledge. When it is required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> should be public, what should be meant by this is not only that each one of <b>the</b> <b>law’s</b> addressees should know what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, but also that everybody should know that everybody knows what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, <b>that</b> everybody should know that everybody knows that everybody knows what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, and so on. This may look unnecessarily complicated.

The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E

5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E
