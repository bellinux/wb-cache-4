5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E

At his second start Poseidon disappointed his backers with a poor third in the AJC Craven Plate, after Antonius had cannoned into him mid-race and knocked <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of him.|$|E

25|$|One last {{attempt to}} capture Moscow {{was made on}} 2 December, but lack of fuel and {{ammunition}} and increasingly stiff resistance prevented its success. By this time, the Soviet air forces had gained air superiority. By 5 December, when the counteroffensive drove Army Group Centre back, they could muster 1,376 aircraft against just 600 German. The Germans possessed just 487 fighters (200 serviceable) on the entire Eastern Front. There were 674 Soviet fighters (480 serviceable) on the Moscow front. When the Soviet offensive began it quickly gained ground. German morale sank and Army Group Centre, overstretched and exhausted, was threatened with collapse. Richthofen's forces, despite enemy air superiority, did all they could to blunt the attack. The effectiveness and determination of German air units improved {{the morale of the}} army. Concentrating aviation against Soviet ground forces, the Luftwaffe delivered a series of attacks that took <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of the Soviet offensive within two weeks. Richthofen's forces bore the main burden of the air defence against the Soviet attack, and had been reinforced with four Kampfgruppen. Hitler had forbidden a retreat, and Richthofen endorsed this view. His refusal to give ground and his tenacity saw him become one of Hitler's favourites. Hitler gave him a further five transport groups to keep his Corps effective. Fliegerkorp VIII would stay on the front until April 1942, fighting a series of Soviet counter offensives.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 Cork {{were back}} in form and O'Grady won his first Munster winners' medal {{following}} a 5-31 to 3-6 trouncing of Waterford. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny. Following an impressive provincial championship campaign 'the Rebels' were the red-hot favourites, however, Kilkenny surprised. [...] Christy Heffernan scored two goals in a forty-second spell just before the interval to take <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of Cork's sails. [...] Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the restart, giving Kilkenny a 3-18 to 1-15 victory, one of their biggest over Cork.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{breakthroughs}} of {{the previous}} two seasons the old order was restored in 1982 with Cork and Kilkenny lining out in the championship decider. [...] Cork were the red-hot favourites following a 5-31 to 3-6 trouncing of Waterford in the Munster final, while Kilkenny had a tough route to the final. [...] Kilkenny bucked the trend when Christy Heffernan scored two goals in a forty-second spell just before the interval to take <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of Cork's sails. [...] Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the re-start, giving Kilkenny an unexpected 3-18 to 1-15 victory.|$|E

2500|$|Neil McCormick {{believed}} otherwise in The Daily Telegraph, finding Anti {{more dependent}} on mood and texture rather than [...] "the practised song-craft that usually knock <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of listeners". NME critic Emily Mackay also felt the album lacked an obvious hit, while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times {{described it as a}} [...] "chaotic and scattershot album, not the product of a committed artistic vision, or even an appealingly freeform aesthetic, but rather an amalgam of approaches, tones, styles and moods". In The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis deemed Anti [...] "sprawling, uneven and opaque", but [...] "at its best, its daring pays off." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was more critical and believed [...] "the ultimate impression the album leaves isn't just that of an artist who failed to follow through on her vision, but who never bothered to conceive one in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extra√±a, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>out</b> of your sails, so you always have to navigate through that as quickly as you can before you start feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark that made you even want to write it in the first place".|$|E
