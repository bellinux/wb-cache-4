The initiative, known as the Technology Demonstration Programme, was scheduled to last approximately 2.5years, during which further financing in the form of €1million was made available by the ESA. The 2009 agreement allowed REL to involve several external companies, including EADS-owned Astrium, the University of Bristol and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in further development work. As a consequence of the enactment of the Technology Demonstration Programme, REL was able to transition from a <b>Technology</b> <b>Readiness</b> <b>Level</b> (TRL) of 2/3 up to 4/5 within a matter of months.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, 19 {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. [...] In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full combat gear then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. [...] Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a basic load of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. [...] A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. [...] Feedback from participants favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. [...] Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. [...] The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. [...] One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces. 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. [...] The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the [...] SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. [...] Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT on the first try. [...] The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. [...] When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG. The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to <b>technology</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>level</b> 7.|$|E

50|$|The cased {{ammunition}} is more advanced in development, partially {{due to the}} fewer technical difficulties and the fewer differences with standard ammunition. It has already reached the required <b>technology</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>level</b> of 5. As of 2008, the {{cased ammunition}} has been tested {{for a wide range}} of operating temperatures, and it has had over 9000 rounds fired (approximately 6500 rounds of Spiral 1 ammunition, and over 2000 of Spiral 2). The second spiral version of the cased ammunition produced a 33% weight reduction (falling just short of the program goal), while the ongoing development of the third spiral of cased ammunition has achieved a roughly 40% reduction. The third spiral is also 30% smaller than standard ammunition. The improvement by the third spiral of cased ammunition over the second spiral was achieved partially by compacting and consolidating the propellant (thereby allowing a smaller cartridge case and round). Having reached a sufficient <b>technology</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>level,</b> the Spiral 2 ammunition is being prepared for a contracted 2000 round delivery. The cased ammunition has shown itself as a virtually risk free option, with present and potential ability grounded in success. In addition, development of the cased ammunition firing weapon has significantly improved understanding of the weapon action and requirements.

40|$|This paper {{shares the}} {{experiences}} of INITS, a business incubator located in Vienna, Austria, which consults to startup firms in Austria and (with partners) in Europe. INITS has investigated the <b>technology</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>levels</b> and market <b>readiness</b> <b>levels</b> of 57 startup firms {{in a variety of}} industries, who are engaged in social or environmental entrepreneurship, where the impact motive prevails over the profit motive. Thus, INITS provides 57 longitudinal case studies of social and environmental innovation in startup firms that have gone through the complete incubation process. Thirteen of these cases underwent an 2 ̆ 7 open incubation 2 ̆ 7 process developed by INITS. INITS has learned a few important lessons from these endeavors. The open incubation method is more focused and streamlined than traditional methods. A formalized Web-based application process, as well as prolonged interaction with fellow startup firms and external experts, identify errors early, which accelerates incubation. Open incubation also achieves higher <b>technology</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>levels</b> and delivers lower technology risk, especially in the life sciences. Finally, open incubation is not restricted to startups that follow the triple bottom line.
