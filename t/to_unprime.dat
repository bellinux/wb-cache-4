40|$|Unpriming is a {{decrease}} in the influence of primed knowledge following a behavior expressing that knowledge. The authors investigated strategies for unpriming the knowledge of an answer that is activated when people are asked to consider a simple question. Experiment 1 found that prior correct answering eliminated the bias people normally show toward correct responding when asked to answer yes–no questions randomly. Experiment 2 revealed that prior answering intended to be random did not unprime knowledge on subsequent attempts to answer randomly. Experiment 3 found that exposure to the correct answer did not influence the knowledge bias but that exposure to the incorrect answer increased bias. Experiment 4 revealed that merely expressing the answer for oneself was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>unprime</b> knowledge. Experiment 5 found that each item of activated knowledge needs to be unprimed specifically, in that correctly answering 1 question does not reduce the knowledge bias in randomly answering another...|$|E
40|$|A {{control group}} of normal readers and three subtypes of {{learning}} disability (LD) were compared in their visual event-related potentials (ERPs) <b>to</b> primed and <b>unprimed</b> words. The LD subtypes {{are characterized by}} deficient performance on tests of arithmetic skill (Group A), reading and spelling skills (Group RS), or both (Group RSA). The primed words were preceded by pictures or spoken words having a related meaning, while unprimed words were preceded by pictures or spoken words having a non-associated meaning. For normal readers, N 400 amplitude was greater <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> words than <b>to</b> words primed by pictures and spoken words. For Group A, parietal N 400 was reduced by spoken word primes, but not by picture primes. For Group RS and Group RSA, neither picture nor spoken word primes reduced N 400 amplitude. These groups were differentiated by the amplitude of parietal N 400. The normal readers displayed a greater left than right hemisphere frontal N 400 amplitude <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> words. This asymmetry was absent in the ERPs of all the LD subtypes.

40|$|From the {{ecological}} and economic {{point of view}} Agropyron elongatum, among perennial grasses, has a special place. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the most appropriate seed priming treatment and whether after a temporary stress removal, primed seeds have a higher recovery efficiency compared with unprimed seeds? In this research, seed was treated with different osmo and hydro priming and evaluated their effect by conducting germination test under drought stress (- 1. 2 and - 1. 4 MPa PEG) and recovery test. Hydro-primed seeds at 10 °C at all times (12, 24, 36 and 48 h) during priming; most indices of germination significantly improved compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds. Also, seeds treated with osmopriming at both temperatures (10 & 15 °C) and all times of priming compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds in the stress level of - 1. 2 MPa, the germination characteristics were improved. However, by increasing the potential of stress, few priming treatments have been able to maintain their superiority. It appears that priming can partially be effective on stress resistance and if the stress threshold is slightly higher than expected (this threshold for the Agropyron seeds in this study was - 1. 2 MPa) cannot have a noticeable effect on resistance to drought stress and can even be harmful too. All treatments which were placed in stressful situations and then moved to fresh water, showed a variety of recovery responses. As we viewed, primed seeds with a solution of - 0. 6 MPa urea for 12 h at 15 °C and followed by PEG solutions (- 1. 2 and - 1. 4 MPa) for 5 days and subsequently moved to fresh water conditions, had higher performance compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds (P< 0. 05).

Participants performed speeded two-choice responses depending {{on whether or not}} a stimulus showed a famous person. In Experiment 1, a facilitation was found in RTs to famous (but not to unfamiliar) faces when primed by the same face shown in an earlier priming phase of the experiment. In ERPs, an influence of repetition priming was observed neither for the N 170 nor for a temporal N 250 component which in previous studies had been shown to be sensitive to immediate face repetitions. ERPs to primed unfamiliar faces were more negative over right occipitotemporal areas than those <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> faces, but this effect was specific for repetitions of the same image, consistent with recent findings. In contrast, ERPs to primed familiar faces were more positive than those <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> faces at parietal sites from 500 – 600 ms after face onset, and these priming effects were comparable regardless of whether the same or a different image of the celebrity had served as prime. In Experiment 2, similar results were found for name recognition—a facilitation in RTs to primed familiar but not unfamiliar names, and a parietal positivity to primed names around 500 – 600 ms. ERP repetition effects showed comparable topographies for faces and names, consistent {{with the idea of a}} common underlying source.

We measured the effect of recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) priming on bacterial internalization, intracellular killing, oxidative burst, and cytokine release during phagocytosis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Eleven-day-old MDM, primed for 72 h with rIFN-gamma (100 ng/ml) exhibited an increased proportion of cells with associated bacteria (31 % versus 26 %, P = 0. 036) and a 67 % increase in internalized bacteria per cell compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> cells (P = 0. 025). Retrieval of viable bacteria following internalization was reduced 3. 6 -fold in 72 -h primed versus unprimed MDM (interquartile range, 3. 1 to 6. 4) at 0. 5 h due to enhanced early intracellular killing, and this difference was maintained up to 24 h. In contrast, cells primed for only 24 h exhibited no increase in early killing. MDM were competent to produce an early oxidative burst when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, which was fully abrogated by the respiratory burst inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), but infection of MDM with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium did not cause {{an increase in the}} early respiratory burst under unprimed or primed conditions, and DPI had no effect on the early killing of bacteria by primed or unprimed MDM. During 24 h following infection, rIFN-gamma-primed MDM released more interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and less IL- 10 relative <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> cells.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} seed priming on emergence, growth, yield and in-store biochemical changes in okra seed, three experiments (laboratory, field and storage) were carried out in 2009 - 2010. In laboratory experiment, seeds were primed in PEG- 8000 (polyethylene glycol) and Mannitol solutions having 0, - 0. 4, - 0. 8, - 1. 2, - 1. 6, - 2 and - 2. 4 Mpa osmotic potential for 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours duration while dry seeds were used as control. Priming proved effective in improving percent germination (27 %) and reducing mean germination time (17. 8 h) as compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds. Priming agents, its osmotic potential and duration significantly affected germination percentage, which increased as osmotic potential lowered from 0 to - 1. 2 Mpa while further lowering (- 1. 6 to - 2. 4 Mpa) osmotic potential adversely affected germination. Similarly germination percentage significantly enhanced as priming duration increased from 6 h to 12 h but further increase in duration from 12 h to 18 h caused insignificant increase in germination percentage. Increase in priming duration beyond 18 h, however, resulted in insignificant decrease in percent germination. Germination was higher for seeds primed with PEG than with Mannitol, but neither priming agent were effective in lowering MGT. MGT reduced significantly as osmotic potential increased from - 2. 4 to 0 Mpa and duration from 6 h to 24 h. For field experiment, seeds were primed in PEG and Mannitol solutions with same osmotic potentials as used in laboratory experiment. Yields were significantly improved through priming as compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds. In priming agents PEG primed seeds gave significantly higher yield than Mannitol. Maximum yield was observed at - 1. 2 Mpa osmotic potential. Priming at high osmotic potential significantly reduced days to 50 % emergence, flowering and maturity as compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> seeds and seeds primed at lower osmotic potential. Minimum days to 50 % emergence, flowering and maturity were recorded for plants raised from seeds primed with 0 Mpa osmotic potential. These parameters were not affected by priming agents. On the contrary plant height, AGR (Absolute growth rate) and RGR (Relative growth rate) were affected by osmotic potential of priming solution. Taller plants were recorded at - 1. 2 Mpa and above this osmotic potential, significantly higher AGR {{was found in the}} range of 0 to - 1. 2 Mpa osmotic potential as compared to other treatments whereas the highest RGR was observed for unprimed seed plots and seed plots treated with lower osmotic potential while less RGR was noted for hydroprimed (0 Mpa) plots.

After treatment, seeds were dried to initial moisture content (11 %) and then evaluated at zero storage, three months and six months storage for their unsaturated fatty acids, hexanal, protein, lipids and electrical conductivity. Results showed reduction in unsaturated fatty acids, proteins and lipids contents and increase in hexanal and electrical conductivity occurred during storage for each treatment but it was significantly controlled by priming with PEG at - 1. 2 Mpa water potential for 18 hour duration followed by priming with Mannitol at the same water potential and duration as used for PEG priming compared to water treatment and dry seeds...|$|R

In contrast, source localisation of the N 170 implicated a significantly more posterior location, corresponding to a lateral occipitotemporal source outside the fusiform gyrus...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{inflammatory response}} {{is required for}} protection against infection, but persistent inflammation causes tissue damage. Dendritic cells (DCs) have a unique capacity to promote both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. One key mechanism involved in DC-mediated immunosuppression is the expression of tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO). IDO has been implicated in diverse processes in health and disease but its role in endotoxin tolerance in human DCs is still controversial. Here we investigated the role of IDO in shaping DCs phenotype and function under endotoxin tolerance conditions. Our data show that TLR 4 ligation in LPS-primed DCs, induced higher levels of both IDO isoforms together with the transcription factor aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), compared <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> controls. Additionally, LPS conditioning induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype in DCs - {{with an increase in}} IL- 10 and higher expression of programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 and PD-L 2 - which were partially dependent on IDO. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the AhR-IDO pathway was responsible for the preferential activation of noncanonical NF-κB pathway in LPS-conditioned DCs. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms of the TLR 4 -induced tolerogenic phenotype in human DCs, which can help the better understanding of processes involved in induction and resolution of chronic inflammation and tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{follicular}} B cells express TLR 9 {{and respond}} vigorously to stimulation with single-stranded CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Surprisingly, follicular B cells {{do not respond}} to direct stimulation with other TLR 9 ligands, such as bacterial DNA or class A(D) CpG-ODN capable of forming higher-order structures, unless other cell types are present. Here, we show that priming with interferons or with B cell-activating factor, or simultaneous co-engagement of the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR), can overcome this unresponsiveness. The effect of interferons occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated through an autocrine/paracrine loop, which is dependent on IRF- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 12 p 40. We hypothesize that the lack of bystander activation of follicular B cells with more complex CpG ligands may be an important safety mechanism for avoiding autoimmunity. This will prevent resting B cells from responding to foreign or self-derived hypomethylated double-stranded CpG ligands unless these ligands are either delivered through the B cell receptor or under conditions where B cells are simultaneously co-engaged by activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells or TH 1 cells. A corollary is that the heightened responsiveness of lupus B cells to TLR 9 -induced stimulation cannot be ascribed <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> follicular B cells, but is rather mediated by hypersensitive marginal zone B cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing a sandwich-masked priming {{paradigm}} with faces, {{we report}} two ERP effects {{that appear to}} reflect different levels of subliminal face processing. These two ERP repetition effects dissociate in their onset, scalp topography, and sensitivity to face familiarity. The “early” effect occurred between 100 and 150  ms, was maximally negative-going over lateral temporoparietal channels, and was found for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. The “late” effect occurred between 300 and 500  ms, was maximally positive-going over centroparietal channels, and was found only for familiar faces. The early effect resembled our previous fMRI data from the same paradigm; the late effect resembled the behavioural priming found, {{in the form of}} faster reaction times to make fame judgments about primed relative <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> familiar faces. None of the ERP or behavioural effects appeared explicable by a measure of participants’ ability to see the primes. The ERP and behavioural effects showed some sensitivity to whether the same or a different photograph of a face was repeated, but could remain reliable across different photographs, and did not appear attributable to a low-level measure of pixelwise overlap between prime and probe photograph. The functional significance of these ERP effects is discussed in relation to unconscious perception and face processing...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT LiCI (2. 5 - 20 mM) {{reversibly}} suppressed nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) -induced neurite outgrowth by cultured rat PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells. Similar concentrations of LiCI also reversibly blocked NGF-dependent regeneration of neurites by PC 12 cells {{that had been}} primed by long-term pre-exposure to NGF and by cultured newborn mouse sympathetic neurons. In contrast, transcription-dependent responses of PC 12 cells to NGF such as priming and induction of the NGF-inducible large external glycoprotein, occurred {{despite the presence of}} Li ÷. SDS PAGE analysis of total cellular phosphoproteins (labeled by 2 -h exposure to 32 p_ orthophosphate) from neurite-bearing primed PC 12 ceils revealed that Li ÷ reversibly inhibited the phosphorylation of a band of Mr 64, 000 that was barely detectable in NGF-untreated PC 12 cells. However, Li ÷ did not appear to affect the labeling of other phosphoproteins in either NGF-primed or untreated PC 12 cultures, nor did it affect the rapid increase in phosphorylation of several proteins that occurs when NGF is first added <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> cultures. Several criteria indicated that the NGF-inducible phosphoprotein of Mr 64, 000 is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). Of the NGF-inducible phosphorylated MAPs that have been detected in PC 12 cells (Mr 64, 000, 72, 000, 80, 000, and 320, 000), several (Mr 64, 000, 72, 000...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that airway eosinophilic inflammation {{can be transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>unprimed</b> mice by infusing interleukin (IL) - 5 -producing T cell clones. Using that murine model, we performed this study to delineate the mechanism of cyclosporin A and dexamethasone to inhibit allergic airway eosinophilic inflammation. The ovalbumin-reactive murine T cell clones, FJ 17, produced IL- 2, IL- 4 and IL- 5 upon stimulation with relevant antigen. In FJ 17 -transferred mice, messenger RNA (mRNA) of IL- 2 and IL- 5 expressed in the lungs, the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased and the bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine was enhanced after antigen provocation. Cyclosporin A (10, 100 [*]ng[*]ml− 1) and dexamethasone (10, 100 [*]ng[*][*]ml− 1 suppressed the production of IL- 5 as well as IL- 2 and IL- 4 by FJ 17 in vitro. Subcutaneously administered cyclosporin A (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and dexamethasone (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) inhibited antigen-induced mRNA expression of IL- 2 and IL- 5, increase of BALF eosinophils and bronchial hyperresponsiveness of FJ 17 -transferred mice in vivo. The number of BALF eosinophils was correlated with the bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine (r= 0. 672). The results clearly indicated that the suppression of IL- 5 synthesis by T cells {{is involved in the}} effects of cyclosporin A and dexamethasone to inhibit allergic airway eosinophilic inflammation...|$|R
