5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory.

5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{the upper and}} lower jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|E
30|$|A {{biological}} {{system is}} a nonlinear system, so {{it is still a}} public problem upon how to control the biological system balance. The predecessors {{have done a lot of}} research. Especially the research on the predator-prey system’s dynamic behaviors has received much attention from the scholars. There is also a large number of research works on the stability of a predator-prey system with time delays. The time delays have a very complex impact on the dynamic behaviors of the nonlinear dynamic system (see [2, 3]).

5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{the remains of}} a plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Roman times, a new Roman mythology {{was born}} through syncretization of {{numerous}} Greek {{and other foreign}} gods. This occurred because the Romans had little mythology of their own, and inheritance of the Greek mythological tradition caused the major Roman gods to adopt characteristics of their Greek equivalents. The gods Zeus and Jupiter are {{an example of this}} mythological overlap. In addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions, the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations. For instance, the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian's successful campaigns in Syria. The Asiatic divinities Mithras (<b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the Sun) and Ba'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus, but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments. The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice. The worship of Sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by Christianity.|$|E

The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E
