40|$|SummaryThe ONS {{analysis}} of The effects of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> benefits on household income, most recently published in May 2011, examines how the Government's intervention, through <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> cash benefits, redistributes income among households. The amount by which <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> benefits redistribute income from richest to poorest, known as their redistributive effect (see text box, ‘Measuring income inequality’) is usually measured by comparing inequality {{before and after}} they are added. This periodic analysis updates ‘The redistribution of household income 1977 to 2006 / 07 article’ published by ONS in 2008. However, it goes further, by separating the redistributive effects over time into two parts, (i) the size of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> benefits, and (ii) {{the rate at which}} <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> benefits redistribute income. ...|$|R
