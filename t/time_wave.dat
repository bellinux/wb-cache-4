In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes.

Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—When Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) is used {{to detect}} the arrival <b>time</b> of {{traveling}} <b>wave,</b> the instantaneous frequency of the component PF may lead to wrong results for detecting the arrival <b>time</b> of traveling <b>wave.</b> From the above, a novel algorithm is proposed to detect the arrival <b>time</b> of traveling <b>wave,</b> and {{it is based on}} Local mean decomposition (LMD) and Teager Energy Operator (TEO). Firstly, the high frequency component of LMD is obtained through decomposing the aerial mode of voltage traveling wave; Secondly, based on Teager Energy Operator(TEO), the instantaneous energy spectrum of PF is calculated; thirdly, the arrival <b>time</b> of traveling <b>wave</b> can be determined according to the first sudden arising of energy in the instantaneous energy of PF 1; and the wave velocity can be measured online by calculating the transfer <b>time</b> of traveling <b>wave</b> on the healthy line. Lastly, the fault distance is calculated according to the principle of the double-ended traveling–wave-based fault location. Under different fault conditions, simulation tests show that the novel LMD-TEO-based method has more accurate than Wavelet Transfrom and Hilbert-Huang Transform in detecting the arrival <b>time</b> of traveling <b>wave.</b> ...|$|R
