5|$|In 1987, Sultan Iskandar {{was accused}} of causing {{the death of a}} golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, {{following}} an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. <b>The</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caddy – who also suffered injuries from the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman he loved.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and made a great show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E

5|$|Guo Xiaoke, who had led {{the first}} Tang {{campaign}} against Karasahr in 644, was installed in Kucha as protector-general of the Anxi Protectorate, or the Protectorate of the Pacified West. The headquarters of the protector-general was thus moved from its original location in Gaochang to Kucha. While Ashina was {{in pursuit of the}} Kuchean king, Nali, a Kuchean lord, traveled to request the help of the Western Turks. Guo was assassinated after the Kuchean soldiers retook the kingdom with the military assistance of the Western Turks. Ashina returned to Kucha, captured five of the kingdom's cities, and forced the remaining cities to surrender. Tang control was re-established in the oasis state. <b>The</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former king, a yabgu or viceroy, was enthroned by the Chinese as a subject of the Tang empire.|$|E
5|$|Illinois {{was laid}} down on 10 February 1897 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was {{launched}} on 4 October 1898, sponsored by Miss Nancy Leiter, daughter of Chicago multi-millionaire Levi Leiter and commissioned on 16 September 1901. The ship's first commander was Captain George A. Converse. Illinois {{was the first}} member of her class to be authorized, but the last to enter service. After commissioning, the ship began a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, followed by initial training. She left the area on 20 November to test a new floating dry dock in Algiers, Louisiana. The ship was back in Newport News in January 1902. She served briefly as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D.

5|$|King Philip VI of France (1293–1350) {{stayed at}} the castle in 1332. Due to the Anglo-French {{hostilities}} the castle was playing an increasingly important role. During the Hundred Years' War the English were given the castle from 1360 to 1385 by the Treaty of Brétigny. The castle was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's regent in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had brought <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keeper to the castle and threatened to behead him unless there was an immediate capitulation. French troops commanded by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid siege to the castle in 1380, {{but it did not}} yield until five years later. The English later regained the castle, but in 1442 Charles VII of France (1403–61) finally captured it from the English.|$|E

Olive Oatman, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation. One anecdotal {{description}} states that Irataba had several wives, among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek {{known as}} Rathurês, ´Ραθούρης) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is {{credited}} with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived {{in the second half}} of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and <b>the</b> <b>brother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.|$|E
