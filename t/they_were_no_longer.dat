From 720/721 however the Arab armies resumed their expeditions against Byzantine Anatolia, although now <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> aimed at conquest, but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the countryside and only occasionally attacking forts or major settlements.|$|E

Archbishop Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, while Ælfhere and his kin were rivals for power with the affinity of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia.

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István sank. Admiral Horthy, commander of the proposed attack, soon canceled the attack because {{he thought that the}} Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> there. This was the last military operation that the Viribus Unitis was to take part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1966, Dalek creator Terry Nation {{pitched a}} {{spin-off}} series The Daleks to the BBC, writing a 30-minute teleplay entitled The Destroyers {{as a possible}} pilot episode for an American co-production. The Daleks was to {{have focused on the}} adventures of the SSS. Lead characters included agents Captain Jack Corey, David Kingdom, his sister Sara Kingdom, and an android named Mark Seven. On 22 November 1966, the BBC informed Nation that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> interested in the project. It was later adapted by Nicholas Briggs & John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in December 2010.|$|E

5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> fighting each other.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E

5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E

The other three ships remained with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron {{for most of their}} careers and did not participate in any of the early naval battles of the war. Natal was sunk by a magazine explosion near Cromarty on 30 December 1915, killing an estimated 390–421 persons on board. Most of her wreck was slowly salvaged over the decades until the remnants were demolished in the 1970s so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a hazard to navigation.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17December; {{in light of the}} growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at Maguwo had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained– as guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} Stanley Cup play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many Stanley Cups the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were Stanley Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> holders of the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Even if the Huskies {{were still}} a strong {{national}} contender, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points {{to go along with}} nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Odile is {{tied for}} the most intense landfalling {{tropical}} cyclone on the Baja California Peninsula during the satellite era. Sweeping across the peninsula in September2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States. The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category4 hurricane peak intensity on September14. The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125mph (205km/h). Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September17. These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> identifiable on September19.|$|E
