40|$|There is over 60 {{years of}} {{experience}} within ICAS on <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> structures design and, together with Faculty of Silviculture and Forest Engineering from Braşov, represent watershed management history within Romanian forestry. Based on this activity a series of instructions and normative has been released in 1949, 1959, 1967, 1995. ICAS realized all spectrum of <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> structures design for investments sector (around 2000 projects and studies during 1951 - 2011) and specific technical documentations such as: themes, instructions, normative in static dam calculation, morphometry and torrential watersheds hydrology, pluvial erosion and landslides mitigation using forest vegetation and complex management of torrential watersheds basins. According to ICAS studies, through whole national territory, in all 15 major catchments were managed 3, 201 torrential watersheds, {{in which they have}} been forested 67, 193. 4 ha of degraded lands and 2, 165. 2 km of torrential riverbed have been improved. The overwhelming majority of these works were designed by ICAS. For the future it is estimated that in the forest fund are required: 29, 936 ha afforestation of degraded land, 127, 000 m 3 of construction works necessary to ensure existing structures, the improvement of 1855 km of torrential riverbeds using <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> structures. Torrential watershed planning issues are: chronic underfunding, permissive legislation in the auctions, the disappearance of traditional firms and workers. Finally is mentioned the opportunity offered by relatively new technology of Aerial Laser Scanners to delivery very accurate digital elevation models usable for better and faster design of specific works and the necessity of methodological research in this direction. With its available specialists, I. C. A.

40|$|Alluvial {{fans are}} often {{present at the}} outlet of small {{drainage}} basins in alpine valleys; their formation is due to sediment transport associated with flash floods and debris flows. Alluvial fans are preferred sites for human settlements and are frequently crossed by transport routes. In {{order to reduce the}} risk for economic activities located on or near the fan and prevent loss of lives due to floods and debris flows, <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works have been extensively carried out on many alpine alluvial fans. Hazard management on alluvial fans in alpine regions is dependent upon reliable procedures to evaluate variations in the frequency and severity of hydrogeomorphic processes and the long-term performance of the torrent training works. An integrated approach to the analysis of hydrogeomorphic processes and their interactions with <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works has been applied to a large alluvial fan in the southern Carnic Alps (northeastern Italy). Study methods encompass field observations, interpretation of aerial photographs, analysis of historical documents, and numerical modelling of debris flows. The overall performance of control works implemented {{in the early decades of}} 20 th century was satisfactory, and a reduction of hazardous events was recognised from features observed in the field and in aerial photographs, as well as from the analysis of historical records. The 2 -D simulation of debris flows confirms these findings, indicating that debris flow deposition would not affect urban areas or main roads, even in the case of a high-magnitude event. Present issues in the management of the studied alluvial fan are representative of situations frequently found in the European Alps and deal with the need for maintenance of the control structures and the pressures for land use changes aimed at the economic exploitation of the fan surface...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many alpine torrents convey {{regularly}} debris {{flows of}} high destructive hazard. After several granular events observed in Bruchji’s torrent near the Blatten {{village in the}} Swiss Alps, {{it was decided to}} manage the risk of similar debris flows by designing and constructing a control structure inside the torrent bed. Associated with a breach in the right bank side of the <b>torrent,</b> this <b>control</b> structure should divert part of the moderate and high debris flow events toward the original alluvial cone. Two different configurations of the control structure were tested and optimized through a series of physical tests. The basic concept of this structure is to create a local lateral contraction of the torrent section topped by a horizontal rack or by a deflector beam. A physical model at the scale of 1 : 20 was built and granular debris flows were simulated by four successive discrete pulses. The behavior of the structure was tested inside the linear part and inside the bend of the channel reach. The geometry and dimensions of the control structure were also optimized to divert laterally a maximum volume of debris flow materials. This paper describes the physical model experiments, presents and discusses the main test results, and proposes an optimized geometry of the control structure. The most efficient configuration consists of a unilateral contract of the channel flow section inside a channel bend and to install a deflector beam...|$|R

Riverbed degradation is discussed by comparing four different longitudinal profiles surveyed in 1928, 1951, 1970 and 1998 in the 120 km long reach upstream of the outlet. The analysis of channel narrowing is carried out by comparing a number of cross-sections surveyed in different years across the same downstream reach. Field sediment transport measurements of seven major floods that occurred between 2003 and 2006 are compared with the bedload transport rates predicted by the most renowned equations.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between environmental restoration and social-economic factors. It focuses on the erosion treatment on the Loess Plateau, especially the Grain to Green Project (GGP), the biggest national-range environmental treatment program in China in recent years. GGP produced significant impact on local landform, landuse and livelihood. On one hand, the program effectively <b>controlled</b> <b>torrent</b> by increasing soil aggregation; on the other hand, it lacked long-term perspectives and had underestimated {{the complexity of the}} environment and of local residents. The thesis seeks to bridge the gaps between soil treatment policy and the actual effect. Research was conducted on soil erosion across multiple scales and key issues are generated based on typical cases. Findings from the research serve as guidelines for the following design proposition. The design applies hierarchical method, including both top-down and bottom-up interventions. First, a division method for erosion states was developed which can divide the erosion problem within the range of the yellow river into small catchment basins. Second, a typical catchment basin was selected as an example to show proposed strategy in three scales: catchment, slope and patches. The core design idea is to conserve resources and maximize output in sustainable ways. The fragmented land patches are integrated to complete the production model. The study site is planned according to field condition, such as erosion process, slope ratio, lighting, water resource and distance to settlements. Patches were identified using vegetation coverage and appropriate planting strategies were proposed accordingly. In sum, the thesis is a critique of existing GGP. A new solution is proposed that can mitigate the conflict of soil erosion treatment and socio-economic development of local communities. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Landscape Architectur...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{and water}} {{resources}} are {{important elements of}} the environment that is managed to reduce the erosion rate and the destructive effects of torrential flooding. Implementation of the measures to reach this goal requires the ranking of sub-watersheds and areas within the sub-watersheds, from most to least vulnerable, which can be achieved using Multi-criteria decision analysis methods. In this paper, using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) II method ranking of nine sub-watersheds delineated in the Topciderska river watershed, Serbia, was performed by using ArcGIS software. The criteria used for determining {{the order of the}} most vulnerable sub-watersheds are land cover, rainfall, soil erodibility as well as topography. The importance of criteria was determined by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and the influence of the criteria weights on ranking results was tested.

40|$|On 24 August 2006, a {{debris flow}} {{took place in}} the Moscardo Torrent, a basin of the Eastern Italian Alps {{instrumented}} for debris-flow monitoring. The debris flow was recorded by two seismic networks located in {{the lower part of the}} basin and on the alluvial fan, respectively. The event was also recorded by a pair of ultrasonic sensors installed on the fan, close to the lower seismic network. The comparison between the different recordings outlines particular features of the August 2006 debris flow, different from that of events recorded in previous years. A typical debris-flow wave was observed at the upper seismic network, with a main front abruptly appearing in the torrent, followed by a gradual decrease of flow height. On the contrary, on the alluvial fan the wave displayed an irregular pattern, with low flow depth and the main peak occurring in the central part of the surge both in the seismic recording and in the hydrographs. Recorded data and field evidences indicate that the surge observed on the alluvial fan was not a debris flow, and probably consisted in a water surge laden with fine to medium-sized sediment. The change in shape and characteristics of the wave can be ascribed to the attenuation of the surge caused by the <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works implemented in the lower basin during the last years...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the impact of rainwater harvesting on mitigation of hydrological extremes. Due {{to the fact that it}} is a very broad topic that cannot be completely elaborated, the work targets selected aspects of this issue. The work is divided into two parts. The first part is divided into the following five chapters: The water in the landscape, Water regime, Hydrological extremes, Water regime adjustment and Legislation. These chapters summarize available worldwide knowledge about rainwater harvesting both in the landscape and in urbanized areas with a focus on mitigation of extreme hydrological phenomena (floods - drought), including legislative security of water management on national and EU level. The second part of the thesis is compiled in the form of an annotated set of four scientific studies, whose results were presented in articles published in scientific journals. The first study targets the efficiency of <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> (hydro-technical point of view and migration of water fauna). The second study focuses on the territory of the Morava River floodplains, where negative impacts of floods and droughts appear repetitively. The study solves the hydrological balance of the area using the WBCM- 7 model. The third study focuses on computation method of the retention drainage capacity in the agricultural area drained by subsurface pipe drainage system. The last paper describes a new application of the Fourier series for detailed simulation of the runoff on a catchment in the dry periods. Within the thesis, these studies have been interconnected by explanatory comments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mitigation}} of torrent related hazards is {{an important}} issue in mountainous regions. Structural mitigation measures have been implemented on hill slopes and in streambeds for more than 150 years in all Europe. Check dams {{play a key role in}} these mitigation plans and can have highly variable functions (horizontal and vertical stabilization of streambeds, consolidation of hillslopes' toe, retention of sediments, modulations of high solid discharges, lowering of streambed slope, etc.). Thousands of structures had been built more than a century ago. Since their construction, land uses evolved, <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works, associated with reforestation, curtailed a part of the sediment production. According to field experience, defining the initial and current functions of some old structures can remain challenging in some cases. To better understand for which purposes thousands of these structures were built during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, we analyzed old books to determine: • what was the history of the comprehension of the processes involved in torrent related hazards? and; • how the use of check dams evolved to take into account this improving comprehension? i. e. how the human actions on watercourses co-evolved with scientific knowledge from the early 19 th centuries to nowadays? The presentation does not aim to determine who, the first, addressed any scientific question: equivalent history and scientific works took place in all regions of the world at different time and the French were not the first to build check dams and to undertook watershed scale mitigation plans. But the French example is interesting because the <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works were planned in mountainous regions at the country scale (the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Massif Central). Initial plans were to reforest mountains, relying on civil engineering works if needed. Their implementation, through the French Mountain Lands' reforestation and grass seeding laws of 1860 and 1864, proved to be difficult for technical and sociological reasons. The Mountain lands' conservation and restoration law of 1882 aimed to better fit local issues. The idea of the presentation is thus to highlight how evolved the historical comprehension of torrential hazards and of the usefulness of check dams in miti-gation plans in a changing environment on the technical as well as on the sociological and regulatory points of view. Pioneering scientific and technical works on torrential hydraulics and check dams will be presented. Describing the global context that leads to French laws of 1860, 1864 and 1882 will allow us to explain the extensive development of the works in more than a thousand of torrents and a hundred of big landslides. We then will discuss the evolution of technics during the beginning of the 20 th century and the changes induced after WWII by the arrival of reinforced-concrete technics. We will conclude the presentation with a synthesis table aiming to highlight the different functions of check dams based on a description of their situations in the watershed, compare to other structures' situations and on shape criteria. This historical perspective will hopefully help people to better understand for which purposes some structures have been built in the past centuries and what lessons can be learnt from this assessment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: At the Hafelekar {{test site}} above Innsbruck three {{different}} triangular and rectangular shaped snow net {{systems of the}} regular providers were installed to study pressure and tension forces. The systems {{were placed in the}} well-known snow drift zone just below the alpine ridge to obtain a maxi-mum snow loading of the snow nets. Since the winter of 2006 / 07 several good years of measurements came up and especially the winter of 2011 / 12 delivered extreme values at the test site. On the 27 th of January 2012 the measurements on site showed between 5, 40 m and 6, 20 m of vertical snow heights {{directly in front of the}} protection barriers. The snow density was in average at 315 kg/m. The snow net systems have a construction height of Dk 3, 5 m; consequently they have been charged with an enormous load of drifting snow. This was for the protection systems an extreme load case beyond the design crite-ria. In our study the Avalanche and <b>Torrent</b> <b>Control</b> (WLV) and the Federal Research Centre for Snow and Avalanches (BFW) surveyed the technological changes in nets as well as the pressure and tension forces. The measured values exceeded the known values from previous studies published in the literature more than one third.

These results give information about the behaviour and reliabil-ity of snow nets in extreme conditions and provide data to optimise the systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} channel {{evolution}} {{over the past}} 200 yr in 12 selected streams in northern and central Italy and aims at reconstructing the evolutionary trends (e. g., trends of channel width and bed elevation) and understanding the causes of channel adjustments. The selected streams have been studied using various sources and methods (historical maps, aerial photographs, topographic surveys, and geomorphological surveys). The selected rivers have undergone almost the same processes in terms of temporal trends; however, the magnitude of adjustments varies according to several factors, such as original channel morphology. Initially, river channels underwent a long phase of narrowing (up to 80 %) and incision (up to 8 – 10 m), which started {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century and was intense from the 1950 s to the 1980 s. Then, over the last 15 – 20 yr, channel widening and sedimentation, or bed-level stabilization, have become the dominant processes in most of the rivers. Different human interventions have been identifi ed as the causes of channel adjustments in Italian rivers (sediment mining, channelization, dams, reforestation, and <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works). Such interventions have caused a dramatic alteration of the sediment regime, whereas effects on channel-forming discharges have seldom been observed. Some notable implications for river management and restoration are (1) the state of rivers before major human disturbances and channel adjustments can rarely be taken as a reference, as at present rivers are far from their pristine condition; and (2) sediment management is and will be a key issue in such fl uvial systems...|$|E

40|$|With {{the need}} to {{conserve}} and improve the environment, it is recommended to employ plant materials in the erosion control of torrents and slopes alongside roads. Considering the well-known properties of some willow species regarding their power of vegetative reproduction, survival in poor soils and often flooded alluvium, we researched into the potentials of the following species: Salix triandra L., Salix purpurea L. and Salix incana Schrk. in the catchment of the warehouse 'Gvozdac', Experimental Estate Goč, Serbia. The research started in 2004 and has continued till the present day. The above-mentioned willow species showed significant efficiency in the bank protection of torrential watercourses and on the moist slopes of embankments and cuts of roads. Some of them can even stand {{a certain degree of}} aridity, while other species, on poor, eroded soil exposed to long and extreme drought, could not survive and did not show the expected effect, which is also the consequence of the absence of maintenance and adequate attention to such erosion-control works. In spite of the above, one of the willow species survived even in the most severe conditions, checking the erosion of the road cut slope and the road construction itself, and prevented the impacts of aggressive atmospheric waters, thus halting the erosion ridges and the removal of the asphalt road surface. The above facts prove that, with adequate measures of maintenance, plant materials can be very successfully applied for both longitudinal structures and to check dams in <b>torrent</b> <b>control,</b> as well as in erosion control on the slopes in catchments, both in civil engineering works and in forest exploitation. The research requires closer attention, extending the interests to some grass and shrub species, with the aim of ecological erosion control and reclamation of endangered watercourses, slopes and, in general, environmental protection and nature conservation. ...|$|E
40|$|If the <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works {{will be used}} {{to reach}} its time-limit, it is {{necessary}} to make an estimation of sediment discharge and to estimate the variation of scouring and deposition. And steady flow experiment will neglect the sediment delivery effect of raising period and descending period in unsteady flow. Therefore, a flume experiment was conducted to measure the sediment delivery and to observe the variation of scouring and deposition with different flowing conditions in order to compare the difference of steady and unsteady flow in this study. According to the experimental results, under the same discharge, during the initial raising period until the ending of recession period,the sediment discharge of raising period in unsteady flow was larger than the equilibrium period in steady flow; and the sediment discharge of equilibrium period in steady flow was larger than the recession period in unsteady flow. And the scouring volume per unit width measured in unsteady flow was 1. 06 times of the estimation from steady flow experimental results and discharge hydrograph of unsteady flow; the deposition volume per unit width measured in unsteady flow was between 0. 69 to 0. 77 times of the estimation from steady flow experimental results and discharge hydrograph of unsteady flow. 欲使河川整治工程在壽命年限內達到預期之目的，適當且合理估計河道泥砂輸送量及沖淤之高程變化是必要的。又一般定量流試驗將忽略變量流昇水段及退水段不同輸砂環境所產生之效應。 故本研究擬利用室內渠槽試驗來觀測不同流況下泥沙運動之沖淤及輸沙情形，及探討變量流況及定量流況之差異性，期能提供野溪治理及河川結構物興建時之參考依據。 試驗結果顯示相同流量條件下，於昇水開始至退水完畢之間，變量流昇水段之輸砂量大於定量流平衡段之輸砂量，而定量流平衡段之輸砂量又大於變量流退水段之輸砂量。另變量流沖刷深度之實測值對由不同定量流試驗量測之沖刷深度累算變量流歷線之沖刷深度推估值比較，其比值為 1. 06 ；而回淤深度之實測值對推估值之比值則介於 0. 69 ~ 0. 77 之間。中文摘要………………………………………………………………Ⅰ 英文摘要………………………………………………………………Ⅱ 目錄……………………………………………………………………Ⅲ 表次……………………………………………………………………Ⅴ 圖次……………………………………………………………………Ⅵ 照片次…………………………………………………………………Ⅸ 一、 前言…………………………………………………………… 1 二、 前人研究……………………………………………………… 3 (一) 推移質運動………………………………………………… 3 (二) 非平衡輸砂………………………………………………… 8 (三) 變量流輸砂………………………………………………… 10 三、 理論分析……………………………………………………… 11 (一) 基本方程式………………………………………………… 11 (二) 變量流假設………………………………………………… 13 (三) 沖淤量分析………………………………………………… 14 四、 研究方法……………………………………………………… 15 (一) 試驗設備…………………………………………………… 15 (二) 試驗條件…………………………………………………… 17 (三) 試驗砂之粒徑分析 ………………………………………… 19 (四) 沖刷及回淤量估算方法 …………………………………… 19 (五) 試驗步驟 …………………………………………………… 21 五、 結果與討論 …………………………………………………… 24 (一) 定量流流況分析 …………………………………………… 24 (二) 輸砂歷線及底床型態之關係探討 ………………………… 30 (三) 流量與輸砂量之關係探討 ………………………………… 35 (四) 定量流之沖刷與回淤分析 ………………………………… 39 (五) 變量流沖淤量之估算值與實測值比較分析 ……………… 44 六、 結論 …………………………………………………………… 47 七、 參考文獻 ……………………………………………………… 49 附圖…………………………………………………………………… 51 附照片………………………………………………………………… 5...|$|E
40|$|The Moscardo Torrent (catchment area 4. 1 km 2, {{range in}} {{elevation}} between 890 and 2043 m), a small stream in the Eastern Italian Alps, displays a high frequency of debris flows (commonly one event per year) that deliver {{large amounts of}} sediment to the receiving stream, and cause concerns for infrastructures located on the alluvial fan and near the confluence. Over the last decades, hydraulic control works were implemented in the main channel to limit bed erosion and to stabilize channel banks. Although the objectives of training works have been only partly achieved, check dams and hillslope stabilization works have affected the sediment transfer from hillslopes to the channels and along the main channel. The effects of hydraulic control works were investigated by means of multitemporal Structure from Motion (SfM) surveys over an area exposed to debris-flow dynamics in which two new check dams were built. Ground-based SfM surveys were taken before and after three debris-flow events (occurred between June and July 2016), allowing the generation of four high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Geomorphic changes caused by the debris-flow events have been assessed {{in order to produce}} the DEM of differences (DoDs with a 0. 2 m spatial resolution) that allowed estimating erosion and deposition volumes in the study area. Furthermore a debris-flow monitoring system has been in operation in the Moscardo Torrent the analysis of the videos and of the hydrographs recorded by ultrasonic sensors permitted to assess the debris-flow volumes. These estimates were used to characterize the magnitude of events in support of the topographic analysis. By examining the changing pattern of erosion and deposition over time it was possible to understand the check dams’ effects on sediment dynamics. Preliminary results show that the new check dams effectively stored sediment transported by the three debris flows. However, once the check dams will be completely filled, they will lose their functionality, letting sediment flow downstream along preferential paths defined by the <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works and by the morphology of debris-flow deposits. Moreover, debris-flow lobes deposited upstream of the check dams could act as sediment sources further increasing downstream debris-flow magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{streams of}} the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia Regions, {{as many other}} Italian streams, have {{undergone}} remarkable channel adjustments in the last decades, which have been induced by a range of human interventions. The paper, which reports {{the state of the}} art about five streams (Brenta River, Piave River, Cellina Torrent, Tagliamento River and Torre Torrent), aims to compare the evolutionary trends of such streams and the factors that have driven to channel changes in the medium and short periods (last 200 years). The selected streams are relatively large (their drainage basins range between 446 km 2 and 3899 km 2) and have very wide gravel channels, often with a braided morphology, in the study reaches. Planform changes, in particular channel width variations, have been analysed using maps and aerial photographs (9 to 12 different maps/photos were available for each stream). Bed-level changes have been investigated through cross-section comparisons and field surveys. The river channels have shown very similar evolutionary trends and magnitude of adjustments. Channel changes were not notable over the 19 th century, whereas the channels have been in an unstable condition in the following period. Narrowing and incision have been the dominant processes during the 20 th century, up to the 1980 s- 1990 s. Channel width reduction has been of 50 - 70 %, referring to the width in the first half of the 19 th century, and bed-level lowering of 2 - 3 m on average, but locally up to 8 - 9 m. A different evolutionary trend, except for the Torre Torrent, has occurred in the last 15 - 20 years, since channel widening and aggradation have been the most common processes. The magnitude of changes during the last phase has been generally much smaller in comparison with those of the previous phases of adjustment. The gravel mining and channelization works have been the main causes of channel changes, in particular as for the main phase of adjustment that took place from the 1950 s to the 1980 s/ 1990 s. The dams (except for the Cellina Torrent), <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works, and reforestation have probably had a smaller effect on channel dynamics than mining and channelization. As pointed out in previous studies, it is confirmed that human interventions have dramatically altered the sediment regime, whereas a significant change of channel-forming discharges has been documented in just one case (Cellina) ...|$|E
40|$|Torrential floods {{represent}} {{the most frequent}} phenomenon within the category of “natural risks” in Serbia. The representative examples are the torrential floods on the experimental watersheds of the rivers Manastirica (June 1996) and Kamišna (May 2007). Hystorical maximal discharges (Qmaxh) were reconstructed by use of ″hydraulics flood traces″ method. Computations of maximal discharges (Qmaxc), under hydrological conditions after {{the restoration of the}} watersheds, were performed by use of a synthetic unit hydrograph theory and Soil Conservation Service methodology. Area sediment yields and intensity of erosion processes were estimated {{on the basis of the}} “Erosion Potential Method”. The actual state of erosion processes is represented by the coefficients of erosion Z= 0. 475 (Manastirica) and Z= 0. 470 (Kamišna). Restoration works have been planned with a view to decreasing yields of erosive material, increasing water infiltration capacity and reducing flood runoff. The planned state of erosion processes is represented by the coefficients of erosion Z= 0. 343 (Manastirica) and Z= 0. 385 (Kamišna). The effects of hydrological changes were estimated by the comparison of historical maximal discharges and computed maximal discharges (under the conditions after the planned restoration). The realisation of restoration works will help decrease annual yields of erosive material from Wа= 24357 m 3 to Wа= 16198. 0 m 3 (Manastirica) and from Wа= 19974 m 3 to Wа= 14434 m 3 (Kamišna). The values of historical maximal discharges (QmaxhMan= 154. 9 m 3 •s- 1; QmaxhKam= 76. 3 m 3 •s- 1) were significantly decreased after the restoration (QmaxcMan= 84. 5 m 3 •s- 1; QmaxcKam= 43. 7 m 3 •s- 1), indicating the improvement of hydrological conditions, as a direct consequence of erosion and <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works. Integrated management involves biotechnical works on the watershed, technical works on the hydrographic network within a precisely defined administrative and spatial framework in order to achieve maximum security for people and their property and to meet other requirements such as: environmental protection, sustainable soil usage, drinking water supply, rural development, biodiversity sustaining, etc. The lowest and the most effective level is attained through PAERs (Plans for announcement of erosive regions) and PPTFs (Plans for protection from torrential floods), with HZs (Hazard zones) and TAs (Threatened areas) mapping on the basis of spatial analysis of important factors in torrential floods formation. Solutions defined through PAERs and PPTFs must be integrated into Spatial Plans at local and regional levels...|$|E
40|$|Most Italian rivers have {{experienced}} widespread channel adjustments {{over the last}} 100 years, mainly {{in response to a}} range of human activities. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show how knowledge of channel adjustment and reconstruction of evolutionary trajectory are or can be used in river management and restoration. The first part of the paper deals with channel adjustments and summarizes the results of recent studies carried out on twelve rivers in northern and central Italy. The second part illustrates three examples of application. The selected rivers have undergone almost the same processes in terms of temporal trends. Initially, river channels underwent a long phase of narrowing (up to 80 %) and incision (up to 8 - 10 m), which started at the end of the 19 th century and was very intense from the 1950 s to the 1980 s. Then, over the last 15 - 20 years, channel widening and sedimentation, or bed-level stabilization, have become the dominant processes in most of the rivers, though channel narrowing is still ongoing in some reaches. Channel adjustments were mainly driven by human actions, but the role of large floods was also notable in some cases. Different human interventions have been identified as the causes of channel adjustments (sediment mining, channelization, dams, reforestation and <b>torrent</b> <b>control</b> works). Such interventions have caused a dramatic alteration of the sediment regime, whereas effects on channel-forming discharges have seldom been observed. The first example of application concerns a new methodology designed for assessing the hydromorphological condition of Italian rivers and for monitoring their condition through time. This methodology is required in the context of the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) which aims to assess the ecological status of rivers not only using biological and chemical elements, but also hydromorphological elements. The second example illustrates the potential of channel recovery in five gravel- bed rivers of north-eastern Italy. After defining four categories of channel taking into account recent evolution, it was analysed how different sediment management strategies could affect future channel dynamics. We concluded that even though both reach and basin-scale interventions may be carried out, it is likely that channels will not recover to the morphology they exhibited in the first half of the 20 th century, since sediment yield and connectivity will remain less than during the 19 th century and the first half of the 20 th century. The last example deals with solutions for promoting future sustainable management of sediment and channel processes in the Magra River catchment. Knowledge of channel evolution and its causes was used as a basis for defining channel and sediment management strategies, coupled with quantification of bedload transport and bed sediment budget, and the identification of areas most suitable for potential sediment recharge...|$|E
