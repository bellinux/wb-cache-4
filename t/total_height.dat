5|$|The South West Coast Path is England's longest waymarked long-distance {{footpath}} and a National Trail. It stretches for , {{running from}} Minehead in Somerset, along {{the coasts of}} Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Since it rises and falls with every river mouth, {{it is also one}} of the more challenging trails. The <b>total</b> <b>height</b> climbed has been calculated to be 114,931ft (35,031m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted 'Britain's Best Walking route' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center's steel {{structure}} topped {{out at the}} nominal 104th floor, with a <b>total</b> <b>height</b> of , in August 2012. The tower's antenna was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and {{the first section of}} the antenna was hoisted {{to the top of the}} tower on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its full height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E

5|$|This board {{terminated}} Hefty {{and hired}} the architectural firm of Whidden and Lewis {{to design a}} new building. Ion Lewis and William Whidden were originally from Boston, but were in Portland for the Portland Hotel project, and Whidden had been employed with McKim, Mead, and White. The board also persuaded the state legislature to authorize an additional $500,000 in bonds to complete the project. Whidden & Lewis designed a four-story structure in a neo-Renaissance style that included a clock tower. Designed to {{be located in the}} center portion of the building, the tower was to rise five-stories above the rest of City Hall with a <b>total</b> <b>height</b> of 200 feet. Due to costs, the clock tower was never built. A domed cupola also designed by Whidden and Lewis was never built. The original building design was praised for the details and symmetry.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's <b>total</b> <b>height,</b> including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E

40|$|Genetic model-fitting {{was used}} to {{determine}} the heritability of anteroposterior and vertical facial proportions in twins. Lateral headplates of 33 monozygotic and 46 dizygotic twins, none of whom had undergone orthodontic treatment, were used. Five proportions, based on four vertical and five horizontal measurements, were assessed: lower facial height, anterior- to posterior-facial <b>height,</b> <b>total</b> facial <b>height</b> to face depth, sella-A-point to sella-B-point, and sella-upper incisal edge to sella-lower incisal edge. Reproducibility was high for all variables. Model-fitting indicated that all the facial proportions were controlled by additive genes and the specific environment. The genetic component was 71 % for upper-to lower-facial height, 66 % for anterior- to posterior-facial height, 62 % for <b>total</b> facial <b>height,</b> and 66 % for sella-A-point to sella-B-point and sella-upper incisal edge to sella-lower incisal edge. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Across quadruped species, {{there is}} a strong {{correlation}} between body mass and the preferred transition speed from trotting to galloping. However, in humans no single anthropometric factor explains the preferred transition speed to a similar degree. In humans the strongest correlations between anthropometric measurements and the PTS come from measurements related to leg length, with a weak correlation between PTS and body mass. In these studies, the strongest correlates came from measurements of <b>total</b> <b>height</b> and lower leg length.|$|E

Although it is the oldest fully wooden pagoda in China, the oldest existent pagoda is the 6th century Songyue Pagoda (made of brick); the oldest existent wooden buildings in China are the Buddhist temple halls found at Mount Wutai, which {{date back to the}} mid Tang Dynasty (618907).|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{skeletal}} and cartilaginous changes take {{place after the}} onset of puberty at various rates and times. Sometime in the late teen years epiphyseal closure (in other words, the ends of bones are fused closed) takes place {{and the length of}} bones is fixed for life. Consequently, <b>total</b> <b>height</b> and the length of arms, legs, hands, and feet are not affected by HRT. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of testosterone. Many of these differences are described in the Desmond Morris book Manwatching.|$|E
25|$|The stone work of {{the two-story}} {{platform}} exhibits a superb sense of architectural organization and advanced building methods.

It has three stories with two pedestal layers and a <b>total</b> <b>height</b> reaching about twenty-five feet. The pagoda consists of simple undecorated pedestal slabs and three-story stupa each of which has five stepped eaves and truncated roofs. These characteristics constitute a typical form of the Korean stone pagodas.|$|E
25|$|The tallest {{bridge was}} the Pont du Gard, which carried water across the Gard river to Nîmes, {{southern}} France.

When crossing deeper valleys, Roman hydraulic engineers preferred inverted siphons over bridges for reasons of relative economics; this {{is evident in the}} Gier aqueduct where seven out of nine siphons exceed the 45m mark, reaching depths up to 123m. The tallest road bridges were the monumental Alcántara Bridge, Spain, and the bridge at Narni, Italy, which rose above the stream-level c. 42m and 30m, respectively.|$|E
