5|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>inertia</b> and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia,</b> meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia</b> on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

The first includes {{an analysis of}} Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data covering the vast deposits in the Amazonis, Memnonia, and Aeolis regions. These postulated ignimbrites have been previously mapped, and at least five high resolution nighttime IRTM data tracks cross the deposits. Preliminary {{analysis of the data}} covering Amazonis Planitia show that local features have anomalous <b>thermal</b> <b>inertias</b> but the ignimbrites as a whole do not consistently have significantly different <b>thermal</b> <b>inertias</b> from their surroundings. Preliminary photogeologic and IRTM studies of the large and small highland paterae have also begun.

40|$|Global {{correlations}} of the regions in which three Martian wind streak types (bright, dark, splotch-related) {{vary according to}} latitude, elevation, albedo, color, and predawn residual temperature provide constraints on models of streak formation and modification. Bright streaks are relatively stable and occur {{over a wide range}} of geographical surfaces. They are elevation-independent, suggesting that their formation is due to atmospheric dust fallout. Dark streaks appear variable from 20 to 40 deg S and at elevations between 3 and 7 km. They are associated with dark surfaces, having high <b>thermal</b> <b>inertias.</b> Splotch-related streaks occur at elevations between 0 and 6 km and at areas of either low or high <b>thermal</b> <b>inertias,</b> which is the cause of its modifying surface winds. Data are graphically presented, and the methods of data collection are fully explained. Regional studies of various types of streaks in Syrtis Major, Syria Planum, Oxia Palus, Mesogea and Pettit Craters, and Noachis confirm that the correlations found at the global level also occur at regional scales...|$|R

25|$|Current Martian surface {{temperatures}} vary from lows of about −87°C (−125°F) during polar winter to highs {{of up to}} −5°C (23°F) in summer. The wide range {{is due to the}} rarefied atmosphere, which cannot store much solar heat, and the low <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia</b> of the soil. Early in its history, a denser atmosphere may have permitted the formation of an ocean on Mars.|$|E
25|$|The oceanic {{aspects of}} these circulations can {{generate}} variability on centennial timescales {{due to the}} ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere, and thus very high <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia.</b> For example, alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation {{play a key role}} in redistributing heat in the world's oceans. Due to the long timescales of this circulation, ocean temperature at depth is still adjusting to effects of the Little Ice Age which occurred between the 1600 and 1800s.|$|E
25|$|The Martian {{atmosphere}} is very thin and composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen and argon. The average surface pressure on Mars is 0.6-0.9 kPa, compared to about 101 kPa for Earth. This {{results in a}} much lower atmospheric <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia,</b> {{and as a consequence}} Mars is subject to strong thermal tides that can change total atmospheric pressure by up to 10%. The thin atmosphere also increases the variability of the planet's temperature. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of approximately −140°C (−220°F) during the polar winters to highs of up to 20°C (70°F) in summers.|$|E

25|$|Although it manifests {{differently}} in different animals, REM sleep {{or something like}} it occurs in all land mammals {{as well as in}} birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM. The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators enjoy more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay in REM for longer, possibly because higher <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia</b> of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation. The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats. In utero, mammals spend more than half (50–80%) of a 24-hour day in REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of Io's thermal {{radiation}} in the mid-infrared spectrum in the 1970s led to conflicting results {{that were not}} explained accurately until after {{the discovery of the}} active volcanism by Voyager 1 in 1979. An anomalously high thermal flux, compared to the other Galilean satellites, was observed at an infrared wavelength of 10μm while Io was in Jupiter's shadow. At the time, this heat flux was attributed to the surface having a much higher <b>thermal</b> <b>inertia</b> than Europa and Ganymede. These results were considerably different from measurements taken at wavelengths of 20μm which suggested that Io had similar surface properties to the other Galilean satellites. NASA researchers observed a sharp increase in Io's thermal emission at 5μm on February 20, 1978, possibly due to an interaction between the satellite and Jupiter's magnetosphere, though volcanism was not ruled out.|$|E
500|$|Of all {{the planets}} in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars {{are the most}} Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' {{rotational}} axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about [...] at the winter polar caps to highs of up to [...] in equatorial summer.

A sharp increase in Io's thermal emission at 5 μm was observed on February 20, 1978 by Witteborn, et al. The group considered volcanic activity at the time, in which case the data was fit into a region on Io [...] in size at [...] However, the authors considered that hypothesis unlikely, and instead focused on emission from Io's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
