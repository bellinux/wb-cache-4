5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of Whitehead and <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E

5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{reactions}} <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p→e+e− and <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcee+e−→p¯p {{are analyzed}} in the near-threshold region.

For that purpose a recently published <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourceN¯N potential derived within chiral effective field theory and fitted to results of a new partial-wave analysis of <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p scattering data is employed. Our results provide strong support for the conjecture that the pronounced energy dependence of <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcee+e−↔p¯p cross section, seen in pertinent experiments, is primarily due to <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p interaction.

50|$|The {{degree of}} logic {{permitted}} in <b>the</b> <b>view</b> varies among different implementations.

The second argument for <b>the</b> <b>view</b> neglects <b>the</b> position that one’s justification for believing a conclusion can be one’s premise for the conclusion, rather than simply one’s justification for the premise. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> is false since it is inconsistent with the closure of knowledge as closure is properly understood...|$|R

In this paper, I use the word 2 ̆ 2 <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood 2 ̆ 2 not in the sense of thought about childhood but of Japanese general image about childhood. The concept can be defined as adult-child relation. First, I analyze sixteen Best Seller Novels in Postwar Japan, which were published between 1946 and 1999. In this way, I use two approaches: the kind of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood and the feeling of Novels 2 ̆ 7 characters. The findings of this analysis show three types of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Japanese childhood. The first is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood as the immaturer being than adult. The second is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood as the relativization of adult-child relation. The third is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood as subject being like adult. Secondly, I analyze the social background in Postwar Japan, which were relate to three types of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Japanese Childhood. There is, for example, the relation between the divorce rate and childhood as the immaturer being than adult, the relation between the ralio of students who enter higher 2 ̆ 7 educalion and The childhood as the relativlzation of adult-child relation, the relation between the trend of child 2 ̆ 7 s right and <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood as subject being like adult, the relation between the total fertility rate and <b>the</b> whole <b>view</b> of childhood in Postwar Japan. In conclusion, (1) In Postwar Japan, <b>the</b> whole <b>view</b> of childhood change a little. (2) The change of social background in Postwar Japan creates the new types of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood. (3) These types of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of childhood are coexistent...|$|R
40|$|The measurands {{of several}} {{reported}} laser-based measurement techniques {{are sensitive to}} both the propagation direction of the laser and <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> direction from <b>the</b> region {{of interest to the}} detector.
