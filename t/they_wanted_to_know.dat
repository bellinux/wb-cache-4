5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the location of a}} large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines Lofty was {{involved}} with was his marriage to the teenage mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Michelle and Lofty's church wedding was a massive target of press speculation before the episodes aired. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> two things, firstly the design of Michelle's dress, and secondly {{whether or not she}} would jilt Lofty at the altar.|$|E
25|$|Kyodo News {{contacted}} Paul Steucke, the FAA {{public information}} officer in Anchorage on December 24, and received confirmation of the incident, followed by UPI on the 29th. The FAA's Alaskan Region consulted John Callahan, the FAA Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations branch, as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what to tell the media about the UFO. John Callahan was unaware of any such incident, considering it a likely early flight of a stealth bomber, then in development. He asked the Alaskan Region to forward the relevant data to their technical center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, {{where he and his}} superior played back the radar data and tied it in with the voice tapes by videotaping the concurrent playbacks.|$|E

25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
500|$|Among other {{information}} retrieved from the archives was {{the revelation that}} the remaining Italian stone mosaics {{were found in the}} burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: [...] "It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed".|$|E
2500|$|Among the Europeans {{who were}} {{influenced}} by Ramakrishna was Principal Dr. William Hastie of the Scottish Church College, Calcutta. In the course of explaining the word trance in the poem The Excursion by William Wordsworth, Hastie told his students that if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> its [...] "real meaning", they should go to [...] "Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar."

He asked Salk to join the fight against polio and research/confirm how many polio types existed. At the time, scientists had discovered three and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if there were more types. [...] Although this type of polio research would be repetitious, boring, and time-consuming the foundation agreed to pay for additional space including equipment and researchers.

2500|$|In 2006, Yorke refused an {{invitation}} from Friends of the Earth to meet prime minister Tony Blair to discuss climate change. Yorke wrote on Radiohead's site that [...] "I {{have no intention of}} being used by spider spin doctors {{to make it look like}} we make progress when it is just words", and told the NME that Blair had [...] "no environmental credentials as far as I'm concerned." [...] He told the Guardian that Blair's advisers had [...] "wanted pre-meetings. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I was on-side. Also, I was being manoeuvred into a position where if I said the wrong thing post-the meeting, Friends of the Earth would lose their access. Which normally would be called blackmail." ...|$|E
2500|$|For their part, the British {{wanted the}} McMahon Act's {{restrictions}} on nuclear cooperation to be relaxed. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the weight and}} dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British V-bombers, and American warheads to be fitted to British Blue Streak missiles. This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium. While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans {{as to what they}} wanted to provide. The United States Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was concerned that a Special Relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies. Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire. Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were [...] "interdependent", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.|$|E

2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I should have said, 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'—I should have used 'influence.' I think that would have been more appropriate. I should not have said 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if he spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year Michelle and Lofty's (Tom Watt) church wedding was another target of press speculation before the episodes aired. According to Holland and Smith, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> two things: {{the design of}} Michelle's dress, and whether she'd jilt Lofty at the altar. The wedding was shot in a church in private grounds to which the press would not have access. But the press still assembled in large numbers, and security people had to be hired to keep camera people away from the story action. Huge lorries were {{parked in front of}} the church's entrance so nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them angry, and they tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were extras needed inside the church. The entire episode, written by David Ashton, was devoted to Lofty and Michelle's wedding day. Brake has said that at the time it was deemed one of the best cliffhangers of the series, with the episode ending as the bride arrives at the church door and hesitates. The birth of Michelle and Den's daughter, and Michelle and Lofty's eventual marriage, helped to consolidate a fast-growing audience. According to Holland and Smith, [...] "The young couple had come together under enormously difficult circumstances". The subsequent storylines were built to keep the audience guessing about the future of their relationship. Had they married for the wrong reasons? Would the relationship survive? What would happen if Lofty wanted his own child? ...|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E

Whereas the ordinary lumber-room of clubs from New Zealand, Hindoo idols, sharks' teeth, mangy monkeys, scorpions, and conch shells--who shall describe the weary inutility of it?
