5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest date back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the Wall was still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of {{the building of the}} Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross {{at the scene of the}} event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated on the east side of the Reichstag building.|$|E
25|$|Much of Gonzales's {{competitive}} fire {{during these}} years derived from the anger he felt at being paid {{much less than the}} players he was regularly beating. In 1956, for instance, he was paid $15,000 while his touring opponent, the recently turned professional Tony Trabert, had a contract for $80,000. He had a poor and often adversarial relationship with most of the other players and generally travelled and lived by himself, showing up only in time to play his match, then moving on alone to the next town. Gonzales and Jack Kramer, the long-time promoter of the tour, had a bitter and inimical relationship dating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Kramer had first beaten the youthful Gonzales on his initial tour. Now they fought incessantly about money, while Kramer openly rooted for the other players to beat Gonzales. As much as he disliked Gonzales, however, Kramer knew that Gonzales was the star attraction of the touring professionals and that without him there would be no tour at all.|$|E
500|$|Rigbey {{also wanted}} to make sure that {{everyone}} liked the character, and eventually nineteen year old, agricultural student Ruth Pritchard was created. Actress (later presenter) Felicity Finch was cast as Ruth. Finch had not listened to The Archers prior to her audition in 1987 and she tried to learn as much as she could about the history of the show before she came to the studio. Smethurst thought the decision to cast a Geordie was [...] "odd" [...] and wrote that it harked back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the show would cast lots of Scottish and Irish actors, irritating the audience. Finch's first scenes as Ruth were broadcast on 15 July 1987.|$|E

500|$|Brett Berk, {{writing for}} Vanity Fair, was {{positive}} about the scripting of the Quinn character in the second season premiere, now that the pregnancy storyline was over, and {{was happy to see}} the return of [...] "evil Quinn". Joel Kelly of TV Squad criticized the decision to pair Quinn with Finn again in the Valentine's Day oriented episode. He saw it as a regression of the characters, and commented: [...] "Yes, it feels like Glee Classic, because the series started with the two of them together. But both of them have changed—Quinn more so than Finn—and having them dating again seems like they're going back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Quinn was the icy lead Cheerio and Finn was the nice but dumb star quarterback." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E
500|$|However, {{according}} to the authorized biography Prism of the Night, by Katherine Ramsland, Rice's father {{was the source of}} his daughter's birth name: [...] "Thinking back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort to give it away, Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien." [...] Rice became [...] "Anne" [...] on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun [...] "Anne," [...] which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as [...] "Anne", and her name was legally changed in 1947. Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien, adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. [...] "I was honored to have my aunt's name," [...] she said, [...] "but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names." ...|$|E

500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never anything good on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E
500|$|Coming Up to Breathe {{received}} positive reception {{from music}} critics. Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "In a concerted effort to revert back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> they were more a rock band and less of a hitmaking machine, MercyMe delivers. While it's certainly not heavy metal, the songs definitely keep driving forward. Guitars are more prominent and production leans on a more earthy formula... MercyMe is able to rock on portions of each song but they always bring it back to a memorable chorus or a hooky verse. That's the formula that has always worked for them, and it does here, too". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted that [...] "For the most part, MercyMe has built a multiplatinum foundation on compelling power ballads. But on this set, the Texas band rocks out with passion and edgy intensity. It doesn't stray so far that it would alienate the faithful, but it delivers a powerful collection of pop/rock that should take the band's career to a new level". She also praised Millard's vocals and called it a [...] "landmark album in an already impressive career". Mark Joseph of CCM Magazine gave the album a B-; he called the album [...] "enjoyable" [...] but suggesting that a stronger producer or A team would have resulted in better lyrics. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars, praising the vocals and string arrangements as well as the choir on [...] "Bring the Rain". Russ Breimeier of The Fish called Coming Up to Breathe MercyMe's [...] "best album to date" [...] and an [...] "impressive {{step in the right direction}} for a band that many have pegged to be too formulaic", but derided the album's [...] "simplistic songwriting".|$|E
500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

2500|$|DECUS ET TUTAMEN — Latin for [...] "An {{ornament}} and a safeguard", {{a phrase}} taken from Virgil's Aeneid, and here {{referring to the}} fact that the inscription serves both as a decorative feature and as a safeguard against the clipping of the coin's edges (this is not a modern concern, but harks back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> circulating coins were made of precious metals).

2500|$|Like {{many other}} economists, Yvan Allaire, from Montreal's Hautes études commerciales {{business}} school, advocate increased electricity rates {{as a way}} to increase the government's annual dividend without resorting to privatization. Others, like columnist Bertrand Tremblay of Saguenay's Le Quotidien, claim that privatization would signal a drift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Quebec's natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices. [...] "For too long, Tremblay writes, Quebec was somewhat of a banana republic, almost giving away its forestry and water resources. In turn, those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures".|$|E
2500|$|Much of Luce's famously acid wit ("No {{good deed}} goes unpunished", [...] "Widowhood is a fringe benefit of marriage", [...] "A {{hospital}} {{is no place}} to be sick") can be traced back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when,</b> as a wealthy young divorcee in the early 1930s, she became a caption writer at Vogue and then, associate editor and managing editor of Vanity Fair. She not only edited the works of such great humorists as P. G. Wodehouse and Corey Ford but contributed many comic pieces of her own, signed and unsigned. Her humor, which she retained into old age, was one of the pillars of Clare's character.|$|E
2500|$|Pakistan International Airlines {{can trace}} its origins <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Pakistan {{had not yet}} gained {{independence}} from the [...] British Raj. In 1945, the country's founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah realized {{the need for a}} flag carrier for the prospective country and requested financial help from wealthy businessmen Mirza Ahmad Ispahani and Adamjee Haji Dawood for this purpose. Around that time, a new airline Orient Airways, was registered in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on 23 October 1946. In February 1947, the airline bought three Douglas DC-3 aircraft and obtained a license to fly in May of the same year. The airline started its operations in June, offering services from Calcutta to Sittwe and Rangoon (present-day Yangon). On 14 August 1947, Pakistan gained independence and Orient Airways started relief operations for the new country. It was the first and only Muslim owned airline in the British Raj and flew from 1947 to 1955.|$|E

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E
