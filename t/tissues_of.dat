40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the regulation of resistin, a recently identified adipocyte-secreted peptide, in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> prolactin (PRL) -transgenic (tg) mice using ribonuclease protection assay. The level of resistin mRNA increased 3. 5 -fold in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> untreated male PRL-tg mice compared to controls. However, there was no difference in resistin expression in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> female PRL-tg mice compared to control mice. PRL-tg male mice have elevated serum testosterone levels and we therefore analyzed the effects of testosterone alone on resistin mRNA expression. Furthermore, the effects of elevated androgen levels on PRL receptor (PRLR) mRNA expression in the adipose tissue were investigated. Resistin mRNA increased 2. 6 -fold in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> control male mice with elevated serum androgen levels. In addition, PRLR mRNA expression was increased in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> male mice with elevated testosterone. These results suggest testosterone to be a regulator of resistin and PRLR mRNA expression in the adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> male mice...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{regulation}} effect of S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine on target organ damage and oxidative stress induced by pyocyanin infection. Methods: Adult male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, NaCl group and SNAC group, both NaCl group and SNAC group received intratracheal inoculation of pyocyanin, and SNAC group received S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine intraperitoneal injection treatment. Then inflammatory mediator contents in serum {{as well as}} number of apoptosis cells, NO content, oxidation reaction product contents and endoplasmic reticulum stress marker molecule expression in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> three groups were compared. Results: Contents of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in serum and number of apoptosis cells in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> NaCl group {{were significantly higher than}} those of control group, and contents of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in serum and number of apoptosis cells in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> SNAC group were significantly lower than those of NaCl group; NO content in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> NaCl group was significantly lower than that of control group, and NO content in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> SNAC group was significantly higher than that of NaCl group; MDA, AOPP, 8 -OhdG and GRP 78 levels in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> NaCl group were significantly higher than those of control group, and MDA, AOPP, 8 -OhdG and GRP 78 levels in lung <b>tissue</b> <b>of</b> SNAC group were significantly lower than those of NaCl group.

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} white spore print. Both the spores and the basidia are dimorphic.

5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Once dissolved, {{distribution}} of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (in this case blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues stabilizes, or saturates, at a rate that depends on solubility, diffusion rate and perfusion, all of which vary in the different <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> the body. This process is referred to as in-gassing, and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process.|$|E
5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body <b>tissues</b> <b>of</b> kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
