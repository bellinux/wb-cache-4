5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> muscles directly attached to <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base, {{so that a}} small downward movement of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base lifts <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|A nodus {{is formed}} where the second main vein meets {{the leading edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> The black pterostigma is carried near <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tip.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the east}} wing is well-preserved, it has {{undergone}} many changes and its initial appearance is unknown. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> has two levels overlooking the courtyard retaining their arcades (now glassed-in), {{which are the}} same shape {{as those in the}} south wing. The southeast end of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> contained a kitchen (with a well) and a large pantry.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper side}} of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is brown with <b>the</b> fore <b>wings</b> having several glassy white spots. The {{underside}} of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> is brown with the body and basal area of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> bright yellow-orange.|$|R

5|$|Another {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> twisted slightly upward along its span, {{the angle of}} incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2017, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{commander}} of the CTWG is Col James Ridley, Sr. The vice commander position is held by Lt Col Rob Roy. The chief of staff is Lt Col Matt Valleau. The vice commander is responsible for coordinating <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> echelon with the subordinate units, specifically the squadrons. The vice commander is also an assistant of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> commander, serving as the coordinator of various special projects. The chief of staff {{is responsible for the}} staff members located at wing headquarters, who are independent of the individual squadrons. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> commander is responsible for connecting the two groups and ensuring that the chief of staff uses <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> staff members to benefit the squadrons who receive these benefits through the vice commander.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown by}} {{cavities}} in <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> bones of larger species and soft tissue preserved {{in at least}} one specimen, some pterosaurs extended their system of respiratory air sacs (see Paleobiology section below) into <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wings</b> are dusky grey, {{sprinkled}} with hoary {{and there is}} a hoary spot {{on each side of the}} thorax above <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> There are two or three indistinct, dusky longitudinal short streaks on <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> Adults are on wing from May to July.|$|R
50|$|The league name {{changed for}} 1998, but <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> success did not. Despite {{the loss of}} Gary Gait to the Baltimore Thunder, <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> still claimed their 4th regular season title in 5 years at 9-3. Once again, <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> were paired up with their arch-rival Bandits in the {{semifinal}} round, and <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> dispatched <b>the</b> Bandits {{just as they had}} in the previous semifinal matchup. <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> advanced to play the Thunder and Gary Gait in the final round, which was a best 2 of 3 series for the one and only time in league history. <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> opened <b>the</b> series with a 16-12 victory at home, before sweeping the series with a dominating 17-12 road victory in Baltimore Arena.|$|R
2500|$|The Army {{funded the}} second phase to {{study the effects of}} {{auxiliary}} propulsion on the helicopter. Bell configured the 533 with two [...] swept-back <b>wings.</b> <b>The</b> sweep of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> was adjusted by maintenance personnel on the ground. [...] Later in the program, the tilt of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> was linked to the collective control to limit lift and to control rotor speed during autorotational profiles. After flight tests to determine the characteristics of the aircraft with <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> installed, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> were removed.|$|R
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most}} of their area forming <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} angle of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base in some Diptera {{there is a}} pair of membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> had detached {{from the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment. Similar cracks were found on <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight path through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> had a flying mission, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{deployed}} to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the No-Fly Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{tour in the}} Mediterranean, No.78 Wing was reorganised at Williamtown. On 16March 1955, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{headquarters}} was re-formed, and Nos.76 and 378 Squadrons were disbanded. No.75 Squadron {{remained with}} <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> augmented on 21March by Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons. On 1April, No.478 Squadron absorbed the maintenance functions of No.77 Squadron. Nos.75 and 77 Squadrons initially operated Meteors from Williamtown and No.3 Squadron was based at RAAF Station Canberra, where it flew P-51D Mustangs. By November 1956 <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> had re-equipped with CAC Sabres {{and all of its}} units were stationed at Williamtown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, six F-15s and 161 personnel {{were sent to the}} Persian Gulf region. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> though never deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom. <b>The</b> <b>wing</b> converted from the F-15A/B to the F-15C/D in 2004. These planes came from Kadena Air Base.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> has {{controlled}} {{many other}} Air National Guard units. Following the inactivation of the 67th Fighter Wing in November 1950, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{was put in}} charge of a few fighter units on the Atlantic Coast. In 1976, <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> even became responsible for the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, located in Texas.|$|E
50|$|Doxocopa cyane has a {{wingspan}} {{of about}} 55 mm. The color of <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> varies by sex. Males show a brilliant electric-blue iridescence on the upperside of <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> of <b>the</b> females lack this iridescence. Females have usually a brown ground color with wide longitudinal bands of orange and white on forewings and hindwings.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> and <b>the</b> Montreal Canadiens {{became the}} first NHL teams to play in Europe, visiting Paris and London. <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> played nine games against the Canadiens and went 3-5-1. <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> did not play in Europe again until the preseason and start of the 2009-10 NHL season in Sweden against the St. Louis Blues.|$|R
