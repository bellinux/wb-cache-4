5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much dissolved gas, <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stop</b> {{pattern is}} {{composed}} of two overlapped symbols and has four bars. <b>The</b> <b>stop</b> pattern permits bidirectional scanning. When <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> pattern is read left-to-right (the usual case), <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> symbol (followed by a 2-module bar) is recognized. When <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> pattern is read right-to-left, <b>the</b> reverse <b>stop</b> symbol (followed by a 2-module bar) is recognized. A scanner seeing <b>the</b> reverse <b>stop</b> symbol then knows it must skip the 2-module bar and read {{the rest of the}} barcode in reverse.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stopping</b> {{force is}} <b>the</b> force exerted on a charged {{projectile}} by the excess {{charge of the}} wake generated by the projectile in the surrounding plasma. Since the wake does not instantly adjust to the projectile velocity, <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force should {{be affected by the}} projectile deceleration caused by <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force itself. We address this effect by deriving the corresponding correction to <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force in a cold plasma. We find that if the projectile is an ion, the correction is small when <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force is due to the plasma electrons, but can be significant when <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force is due to the ions...|$|R
50|$|There are 108 {{possible}} 11-unit wide symbols, and {{the code}} uses all possible symbols. Two of the symbols {{are used for}} stop (end-of-barcode) indication, stop and reverse <b>stop.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>stop</b> symbols are merged into a 13-unit long <b>stop</b> pattern. Reading <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> pattern left to right is <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> pattern (followed by a 2-unit bar), and reading <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> pattern right to left is <b>the</b> reverse <b>stop</b> pattern (followed by a 2-unit bar).|$|R

5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> and the keyboards from the console.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. These {{can be used in}} combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and {{can also be used to}} rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E

The song became a top 40 single on the UK R'n'B chart, in Iceland and in Belgium. The song has since been certified Gold for sales exceeding 500,000. Jay and West performed the song at all <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> on their 2011 Watch the Throne Tour.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork {{were included in}} the construction of the stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of {{the commune}} {{began with the}} {{establishment}} of the village of El Emn in 1960, followed by the main village of Ten Hamadi in 1962. El Bakhakh was established in 1972, {{and is one of the}} fastest-growing settlements in the commune. Its population more than doubled between 2000 and 2007, from 111 to an estimated 230, making it more populous than the main village of Ten Hamadi. Egueni Ehl Ahmed Zein, established in 1980, on the other hand, has declined in population by more than 75percent, with a population of 1,252 in 2000 to an estimated 284 in 2007.

5|$|Summer Hill {{railway station}} {{is located on}} the Airport, Inner West & South Line of the Sydney Trains network. The railway station was opened on 15 September 1879, and most of the local shops are {{clustered}} close to the station. Travelling towards the city, the railway stops in order are Lewisham, Petersham, Stanmore, Newtown, Macdonaldtown, Redfern, Central, and Town Hall. Travelling west towards Strathfield, <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> are Ashfield, Croydon, Burwood, Strathfield and Homebush. A renovation and easy access upgrade of the railway station was completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced swell pedal. This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
5|$|By lap ten, Hamilton {{had built}} a three-second lead over his {{teammate}} Rosberg, who was an additional 1.7 seconds ahead of Vettel. While some drivers came into the pit lane for their first regular stop as early as lap 13, the top runners stayed out until lap 37, when Vettel {{was the first to}} come in, followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively. Following <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds. Max Verstappen dropped down the order when a problem {{at the rear of the}} car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30. Fernando Alonso, who had been running in ninth place, retired from the race with a gearbox failure on lap 43. By lap 45, Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds, while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
