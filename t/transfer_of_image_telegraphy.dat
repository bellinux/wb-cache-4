Then according to the definition of similarity measure, the correspondence between the sample sets is established. Third, use the best matching algorithm to find the best matching samples of the target sample set in the source sample set and pass the color information to the target sample points. At last, take color <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the non-sampled part in the target image with the sampled set which has been taken color transfer.

It offers better reconciliation/ verification, better customer service and enhanced customer window. Operational efficiency provides a direct boost to bottom lines of banks as clearing of local cheques is a high cost low revenue activity. Besides, it reduces operational risk by securing the transmission route. Centralized image archival systems ensure that data storage and retrieval is easy. Reduction of manual tasks leads to reduction of errors. Real-time tracking and visibility of the cheques, less frauds with secured <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>images</b> to the RBI are other benefits that banks derive from this solution.|$|R
