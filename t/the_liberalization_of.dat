Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E

With a population that was 75 percent Armenian, official petitions were sent by Armenian leaders to the Soviet government in Moscow {{in order to address}} the issue but were rejected by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The demands to annex the region came in the middle of Gorbachev's reform policies, Glasnost and Perestroika. First implemented in 1985, when Gorbachev came into power, <b>the</b> <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> political and economical constraints in the Soviet Union gave birth to numerous nationalist groups in the different Soviet republics who insisted that they be given the right to secede and form their own independent countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes new {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberalization</b> level <b>of</b> free trade agreements (FTAs). Our measures take three issues into account.

Second, our measure includes information on tariff margins, i. e. the difference between FTA rates and most favoured nation rates. Third, the restrictiveness of rules of origin (RoOs) is also taken into account in order to penalize <b>the</b> <b>liberalization</b> level <b>of</b> products with more restrictive RoOs.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the functioning of the Egyptian political system in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic system of the Arab Republic of Egypt. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> began in <b>the</b> 1970 's, but accelerated in the late 1980 's and the early 1990 's. This was an effect of the pressure exerted by international financial institutions involved in the Egyptian economy which in the 1980 was in very poor condition. All this led to debt reduction as well as the reduction of state influence on various spheres of socio-economic life through which the Egyptian authoritarian regime could control the whole society. In order to secure its position and ensure the stability of the government, the authorities need to tighten repression against the increasingly radical opposition, and thus bring about what Eberhard Kienle called "deliberalisation", i. e. <b>the</b> economic <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian political system...|$|R

Econometric testing of indicators intended to proxy financial sector stability-subdivided into exchange rate and banking sector stability-suggests that opening of the financial sector is an efficient policy instrument {{at the disposal of}} the authorities for achieving a variety of macroeconomic goals. While liberalization is found to be broadly conducive to stability, <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> on exchange rate stability is less predictable than on banking sector stability. ...|$|R

Hypotheses are derived for how endogenous institutional adjustments affect the growth response to liberalization.
