5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, {{who died in a}} car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> response.

5|$|Concerned {{that the}} German Army posed {{a threat to}} Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom {{relocated}} to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Kremlin, where Lenin lived {{with his wife and}} sister Maria in a first floor apartment adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of his life. It was in the city in August 1918 that he survived a second assassination attempt; he was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist Revolutionary, Fanny Kaplan, was arrested and executed. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for him and boosting his popularity. As a respite, in September 1918 Lenin was driven to the Gorki estate, just outside Moscow, recently acquired for him by the government.|$|E

5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can be rotated by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, the Grim Reaper chases after the player-character; the Reaper will rip out Cooper's soul if the character does not leave <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> time. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E

5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> {{which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find {{the remains of the}} victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the wishes of the Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E
5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> which Selena had been shot.|$|E

As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>In</b> the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other.

5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase which leads to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is {{sent back to the}} beginning of the current loop.|$|E
