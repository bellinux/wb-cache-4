50|$|The TRST pin is an {{optional}} active-low reset to the <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> - usually asynchronous, but sometimes synchronous, {{depending on the}} chip. If the pin is not available, the <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> can be reset by switching to the reset state synchronously, using TCK and TMS. Note that resetting <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> doesn't necessarily imply resetting anything else. There are generally some processor-specific JTAG operations which can reset {{all or part of}} the chip being debugged.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a tool which {{is capable of}} verifying an 1149. 1 <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> implementation and its compliance to the IEEE 1149. 1 Standard [1][2] while providing a precise list of errors as well as good debug and diagnostic information using graphical analysis. The paper provides {{a review of the}} methods used to perform the logic verification. We introduce an efficient technique for verifying the correspondence of chip I/O with the boundary scan register and for verifying large scan registers. The tool is independent of how the <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> is instantiated. The tool requires only the design netlist, cell library definition, and its BSDL [2] identifying what 1149. 1 <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> has been implemented. Results on current large ASIC designs is included [10]. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the load frequency control in isolated ac microgrid using fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>table</b> control. The objective of load frequency control {{is to hold}} the frequency constant against any load changes. The main task of microgrid is to maintain the voltage level supply to the loads. Any mismatch between the power generations and loads create to the major problem of frequency fluctuation that effected to the active power sharing and reliability in microgrid power flow. In this paper, {{the model of the}} generation unit in microgrid is carried out for proposing the load frequency control using fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>table.</b> The comparison of the proposed method is compared with the common proportional integral (PI) controller. The simulation results have shown that the proposed method is better than PI controller in term of transient performance. The simulation is carried out through the Matlab/Simulink environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose several methods of {{generating}} large benchmark circuits for <b>testing</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis tools. The benchmarks are derived from real circuits, {{so that they are}} functionally equivalent to their origins. We introduce misleading and/or redundant structures into them, making the benchmark size blow up significantly, with respect to the original circuit. Such benchmarks can be advantageously used for <b>testing</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis tools; the aim is to discover whether particular synthesis processes are sensitive or immune to particular circuit transformations. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of surface mounted devices {{a great deal of}} concern and discussion has gone into determining how to test boards crammed with these high-density devices. In 1990 these concerns resulted in ANSI/IEEE Standard 1149. 1 - 1990, Standard Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture. This stan-dard defines <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> that can be included on an integrated circuit to provide standardized approaches to testing the component itself or the interconnections between components on a printed circuit board. The standard also allows for observing or controlling the behavior of a component during its normal operation. The <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> allows <b>test</b> instructions and test data to be fed to a component, and upon execution of an instruction, allows the results to be read out and observed. All instructions, test data, and results are communicated in serial format. The <b>test</b> <b>logic</b> defined by the standard consists of a chain of boundary-scan cells and <b>test</b> support <b>logic,</b> which are accessed through the TAP inputs (see Fig. 1). A boundary-scan cell is a shift-register stage that is connected between each input or output pin on an IC and the application logic to which each pin is normall...|$|R
