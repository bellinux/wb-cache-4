5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
500|$|The {{numbers of}} {{performers}} used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering {{compared to the}} regular comedy or serious play, where the norm was something like 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes {{like that of the}} cyclops, and all the cupids who will join <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see [...] "Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, and hers by doves".|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The God Complex" [...] {{took place}} in February 2011. It was then filmed mainly on hotel sets constructed in the studio. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory's first encounter with a fear in the hotel is the ventriloquist dummies found in Joe's room; Whithouse wanted to include something [...] "big and bold" [...] and noted that there was [...] "something macabre about ventriloquist dummies". Many members of the crew were brought in to operate the dummies, most of them having to lie underneath <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The actor who portrayed the Minotaur, Spencer Wilding, was six foot seven inches tall. Wilding received a costume fitting in early 2011, after which the suit was dressed up with paint and fur.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as only she could calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: I still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and yelled [...] "I want nanny, I want nanny", to her great displeasure. [...] "What a naughty child" [...] she said. [...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{stresses}} {{responsible for}} the elongate ridges and scarps must have occurred {{after the end of}} the primordial bombardment and after emplacement of the intermediate plains unit. Where smooth plains material abuts ridges and scarps, the evidence is mostly ambiguous because we cannot tell if ridge formation involved smooth plains material or if the ridges are upwarped intermediate plains material with smooth plains material ponded against <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of some craters, such as Gluck, scarps apparently offset material mapped as smooth plains, but the exposures are so small that this interpretation could easily be challenged. Ridges appear to be both older and younger than medium-size craters (30–60km in diameter) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intermediate plains unit, but intersections of ridges with craters in this size range are too rare to constrain the time of ridge formation. Thus, ridge formation obviously occurred after emplacement of the intermediate plains unit, but how long after remains uncertain in this quadrangle.|$|R
