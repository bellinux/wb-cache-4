40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the inhibitory effects of <b>taltobulin</b> (HTI- 286), a synthetic analogue of natural hemiasterlin derived from marine sponges, on hepatic tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The potential anti-proliferative effects of HTI- 286 on different hepatic tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo were examined. RESULTS: HTI- 286 significantly inhibited proliferation {{of all three}} hepatic tumor cell lines (mean IC 50 = 2 nmol/L +/- 1 nmol/L) in vitro. Interestingly, no decrease in viable primary human hepatocytes (PHH) was detected under HTI- 286 exposure. Moreover, intravenous administration of HTI- 286 significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo (rat allograft model). CONCLUSION: HTI- 286 might be considered a potent promising drug in treatment of liver malignancies. HTI- 286 is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} design, {{synthesis}} and biological characterisation {{of a novel}} hybrid drug by conjugation of two tubulin inhibitors, a hemiasterlin derivative A (H-Mpa-Tle-AHA-OH), obtained by condensation of three non-natural amino acids, and cis- 3, 4 ′, 5 -trimethoxy- 3 ′aminostilbene (B). As we have previously demonstrated synergy between A and B, we used a monocarbonyl derivative of triethylene glycol as linker (L) to synthesise compounds A-L and A-L-B; via HPLC we analysed the release of its potential hydrolysis products A, A-L, B and B-L in physiological fluids: the hybrid A-L-B undergo hydrolysis in rat whole blood of the ester bond between A and L (half-life = 118. 2 ± 9. 5 min) but not the carbamate bond between B and L; the hydrolysis product B-L was further hydrolyzed, but with a slower rate (half-life = 288 ± 12 min). The compound A-L was the faster hydrolyzed conjugate (half-life = 25. 4 ± 1. 1 min). The inhibitory activity of the compounds against SKOV 3 ovarian cancer cell growth was analysed. The IC 50 values were 7. 48 ± 1. 27 nM for A, 40. 3 ± 6. 28 nM for B, 738 ± 38. 5 nM for A-L and 37. 9 ± 2. 11 nM for A-L-B. The anticancer effect of A-L-B was evidenced to be obtained via microtubule dynamics suppression. Finally, we stated {{the expression of the}} active efflux transporters P-gp (ABCB 1) and MRP 1 (ABCC 1) in the human normal colon epithelial NCM 460 cell line by reverse-transcription PCR. Via permeation studies across NCM 460 monolayers we demonstrate the poor aptitude of A to interact with active efflux transporters (AET) : indeed, the ratio between its permeability coefficients for the basolateral (B) → apical (A) and B → A transport was 1. 5 ± 0. 1, near to the ratio of <b>taltobulin</b> (1. 12 ± 0. 06), an hemiasterlin derivative able to elude AETs, and significantly different form the ratio of celiprolol (3. 4 ± 0. 2), an AET substrate...|$|E
