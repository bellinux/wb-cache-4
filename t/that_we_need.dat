500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Afghanistan, Dutton wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper, in which he opined that the NATO-led forces in the country were making a {{difference}} and the situation was improving, but that the Afghan government still required assistance. He argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence, saying that [...] "experience shows that after an initial spike as the insurgents are cleared out, violence reduces to much lower levels" [...] and that [...] "providing {{a sense of security}} depends on much more than physical troop presence, but it has to start with <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>need</b> sufficient troops to protect the people and convince them that Afghan government control (supported by [...] for the moment) is sufficient to prevent the return of the insurgents. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "the backbone of the NATO alliance gives the coalition a steadfastness which [...] "coalitions of the willing" [...] cannot match. It also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on the consensus of its members". Dutton concluded that [...] "given the strength of this unparalleled military coalition, and the political and financial commitment to building the long-term stability of Afghanistan and the region, failure should not be contemplated". He was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer), and given permission to wear the decoration, [...] "in recognition of meritorious, gallant and distinguished services during coalition operations in Afghanistan".|$|E
500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling {{of right and wrong}} as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E

[...] Grevious attended Constitution Elementary School and then Dunbar Junior and High School, both segregated schools, almost always bringing home good grades. She credited her mother with giving her the drive and self-confidence to succeed: [...] "She instilled in us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to be the very best <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could. <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to have a goal and that that goal would mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to depend on other people to help us get there; which meant we couldn't waste our time and energy doing stupid things, getting into trouble." ...|$|R
