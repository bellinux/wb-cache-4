25|$|This uniform was {{standard}} for all branches of ROTC. Since the OSUMB was under {{control of the}} ROTC department for much of its early existence, the band uniform was simply the ROTC uniform with more additions, such as plumes, gloves, and West-point style Cadet cross belts. The red and gray plumes took on more of an upright style that is still seen today. Kappa Kappa Psi, the national honorary band fraternity, designed a special recognition bar for wear on band uniforms by brothers during these early days of college bands. This recognition bar is {{the same size and}} shape as a military ribbon. The bar is blue and white, separated along a diagonal axis, with the Greek letters K K Ψ along this diagonal. The letters are gold. <b>This</b> <b>bar</b> was to be worn on uniforms {{in the same manner as}} military ribbons, and the OSUMB allowed all KKY brothers to wear <b>this</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

In 2001, Gatorade introduced the Gatorade Performance Series, a special line of sports nutrition products. These products include Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Drink, Gatorade Protein Recovery Shake, the Gatorade Nutrition Shake, and the Gatorade Nutrition Bar. The Endurance Formula, introduced in 2004, contained twice the sodium and three times the potassium of the typical Gatorade formula as well as chloride, magnesium and calcium, to better replace what athletes lose while training and competing.|$|E

25|$|On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing {{redundancy}} among TNN and CMT when it merged {{them into}} its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, {{and in the}} process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and {{changed its name to}} The National Network. The network's name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel's original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom's acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal's USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s. During this time, the channel began placing a black bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen that was used to identify the program currently airing and to promote upcoming programs on the channel; <b>this</b> <b>bar</b> was eventually dropped by the fall of 2002.|$|E

His partners in the enterprise were Pere Romeu, who largely played host to the bar, as well as Rusiñol and Miquel Utrillo. The bar hosted tertulias and revolving art exhibits, including one of the first one-man shows by Pablo Picasso; the most prominent piece in its permanent collection was a lighthearted Casas self-portrait, depicting him smoking a pipe while pedaling a tandem bicycle with Romeu as his stoker. The original of the paintingor most of it: nearly a third of the canvas was cut away by an intervening owneris now in Barcelona's Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC); a creditable reproduction resides in the revived Els Quatre Gats.|$|E

25|$|That night, Matamoros {{was flooded}} with 15,000 spring {{tourists}} from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, Álvaro Obregón.

After a few drinks, Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Café for spring break. <b>This</b> <b>bar</b> was louder and wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony.

As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across Álvaro Obregón street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends to walk across the border uninterrupted and in a group.|$|E
