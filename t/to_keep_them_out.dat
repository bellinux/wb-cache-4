5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, after a {{successful}} {{campaign in the}} Nha Trang region, Nguyễn Ánh ordered de Puymanel to build a citadel at Duyen Khanh, near the city, instead of retreating south with the seasonal northeasterly breeze. A Nguyen garrison was established there {{under the command of}} Nguyễn Ánh's eldest son and heir, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, assisted by Pigneau and de Puymanel. The Tây Sơn laid siege to Duyen Khanh in May 1794, but Nguyen forces were able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> Shortly after the siege ended, reinforcements arrived from Saigon and offensive operations against the Tây Sơn duly resumed. The campaign {{was the first time that}} the Nguyễn were able to operate in Tây Sơn heartland during an unfavorable season. The defensive success of the citadel was a powerful psychological victory for the Nguyễn, demonstrating their ability to penetrate Tây Sơn territory at all times of year. The Nguyễn then proceeded to slowly erode the Tây Sơn heartland.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out of a desire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something {{that had belonged to}} their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's nonsense," [...] a downy, day-old bee answered. [...] "In {{the first}} place, I {{never heard of}} a Death's Header coming into a hive. People don't do such things. In the second, {{building}} pillars <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>'em</b> <b>out</b> is purely a Cypriote trick, unworthy of British bees. In the third, if you trust a Death's Head, he will trust you. Pillar-building shows lack of confidence. Our dear sister in grey says so." ...|$|R

"Well, that's partly true, Master Marner," [...] said Dolly, sympathetically; [...] "and if you can't {{bring your}} mind to frighten her off {{touching}} things, you must {{do what you can}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>'em</b> <b>out</b> of her way. That's what I do wi' the pups as the lads are allays a-rearing. They will worry and gnaw--worry and gnaw they will, if it was one's Sunday cap as hung anywhere so as they could drag it. They know no difference, God help 'em: it's the pushing o' the teeth as sets 'em on, that's what it is." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> {{of the hands}} of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E
5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2014 the Mavs {{handed the}} Suns {{one of three}} {{straight}} losses <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the playoffs, 101-98. The other losses from rival San Antonio and the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E

25|$|Plugs – Earplugs {{are short}} {{cylindrical}} pieces of jewelry. Some plugs have flared ends {{to hold them}} in place, others require small elastic rubber rings (O-rings) <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from falling <b>out.</b> They are usually used in large-gauge piercings.|$|R
25|$|As an {{immediate}} {{consequence of the}} Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the public eye.|$|E
25|$|Before retreating, Romanian troops {{burned down}} the oil wells at Ploiești {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} wheat fields so as <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> {{of the hands of}} the Central Powers. After Falkenhayen's Ninth Army cut off a portion of the Romanian Army, the remainder retreated to the Siret–Putna defensive line, one of the outermost defensive lines of Bucharest. There they rendevouzed with the Bucharest garrison and prepared to hold the line.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{around the}} mid-19th century, Wigan pit-brow girls scandalised Victorian society by wearing {{trousers}} {{for their work}} at the local coal mines. They wore skirts over their trousers and rolled them up to their waists <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the way. Although pit-brow lasses worked above ground at the pit-head, their task of sorting and shovelling coal involved hard manual labour, so wearing the usual long skirts of the time would have greatly hindered their movements.|$|E
50|$|Balloon {{catheters}} are catheters {{that have}} balloons at their tip <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from slipping <b>out.</b> For example, the balloon of a Foley catheter is inflated when the catheter is {{inserted into the}} urinary bladder and secures its position.|$|R

25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change {{things in the world}} that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E
25|$|Dysdera {{are one of}} the few known {{arthropods}} to {{hunt and}} prey on woodlice, which is their main food source. Their wide jaws and large fangs help to overcome woodlice hard armor like shells, as well as their ability to release chemicals <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of harm's way. These adaptations also enable them to prey on other common ground-dwelling invertebrates such as silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, and small burying beetles. Dysdera crocata is the only species from the Dysdera family to prey on other spiders. Dysdera spiders' huge, sharp fangs make them very powerful predators for their size, allowing them to dominate, and sometimes kill, competitors such as centipedes and other spiders.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> We were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E

5000|$|The redbacks {{and change}} notes were {{redeemed}} and cut-cancelled. The notes were cut-cancelled <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from going <b>out</b> {{the back door}} and coming back in the front door to be redeemed again. These notes are highly sought after by collectors. A few notes were never redeemed or cut-cancelled; those notes are valued more highly.|$|R
25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, a depressing atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a leftward course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the revolutionary left.|$|E
25|$|As the British advanced, {{the hostages}} in Akbar Khan's hands were treated less {{severely}} than previously, {{although they were}} moved to Bamian <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of reach of the British armies. Nott was urged to send cavalry to rescue the hostages, but he declined to do so (possibly {{as a result of}} a minor disaster on 29 August, when his cavalry had suffered heavy losses in a mishandled attack). Instead, Pollock sent Qizilbashi irregular cavalry under Richmond Shakespeare (his Military Secretary) and infantry under Brigadier Sale to rescue them. They found that when news of the Afghan defeats reached their guards, the hostages, including Sale's own wife, had negotiated their own release in return for payments. In all, thirty-five British officers, fifty-one private soldiers, twelve officers' wives and twenty-two children who had been taken hostage by Akbar Khan were released.|$|E
25|$|The UPMC Sport Performance Complex was {{designed}} by the architectural firm L. D. Astorino Associates, Ltd. Development was managed by Oxford Development Company and construction of the complex by Mascaro Construction was initiated in June 1999 and completed on September 5, 2000 although the Panthers and Steelers moved into their respective portions of the facility in August. The complex was completed at a cost reported from $30 to $80 million and, as part of Pittsburgh’s urban river-front revitalization effort, {{is located on the}} former site of the Jones & Laughlin, and later LTV, steel mill in the SouthSide Works. The MRI room had to be encased in five layers of steel plate, plus a sixth layer of copper, in order to shield the MRI machines from the nearby CSX railroad tracks. Fill was also brought in to raise the level of the land where the practice fields are by nine feet in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the flood plain.|$|E
25|$|Tucker {{strongly}} {{believed that}} future attorneys needed a proper legal education before beginning to practice, and would sometimes even cover a student's fees <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from dropping <b>out.</b> Tucker's reputation quickly grew, and the College soon took in law students from other states, {{and even from}} overseas. Attorneys would sometimes recommend a term of Tucker's courses to people reading the law under them.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Cuomo led HUD {{efforts to}} {{negotiate}} {{an agreement with}} the United States' largest handgun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, that required Smith & Wesson to change the design, distribution and marketing of guns to make them safer and <b>to</b> help <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the hands of children and criminals. Budgets enacted during his term contained initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing and home ownership, and to create jobs and economic development. These included new rental assistance subsidies, reforms to integrate public housing, higher limits on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a crackdown on housing discrimination, expanded programs to help homeless people get housing and jobs, and creation of new Empowerment Zones.|$|R
50|$|The primary adversary of the gens de couleur {{before and}} into the Haitian Revolution were the poor white farmers and trademen of the colony, known as the petits blancs (small whites). Because of the freedmen's {{relative}} economic success in the region, the white farmers often resented their social standing and worked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> shut <b>out</b> of government. Beyond financial incentives the free coloreds caused the poor whites further problems in finding women {{to start a family}} because the successful mulattoes often won the hands of the small number of eligible bachelorettes on the island. With growing resentment, the working class whites monopolized assembly participation and caused the free people of color to look to France for legislative assistance.|$|R
25|$|The Confederate army {{experienced}} a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery. Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians. After 1863 the invading Union forces had {{a policy of}} shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need - in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers {{experienced a}} growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.|$|E
25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to wonder {{how many of the}} abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of the}} First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
500|$|Shelters are {{generally}} maintained by local volunteers. Almost all shelters {{have one or}} more pre-hung food hangers (generally consisting of a short nylon cord with an upside-down tuna can suspended halfway down its length) where hikers can hang their food bags <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> {{of the reach of}} rodents. In hiker lingo, these are sometimes called [...] "mouse trapezes." ...|$|E
50|$|Local law {{enforcement}} {{and the federal government}} have resisted judicial requests for information about the use of stingrays, refusing to turn over information or heavily censoring it. In June 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union published information from court regarding the extensive use of these devices by local Florida police. After this publication, United States Marshals Service then seized the local police's surveillance records in a bid <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from coming <b>out</b> in court.|$|R
50|$|After two graboids are killed, {{the third}} one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming {{to the surface and}} then {{attaches}} it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> secret <b>out</b> of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence were known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings. Hiram settles in Rejection, building his home in the same place where his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 Gatling gun and begins target practice, enjoying it.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} kinds of mild, safety-oriented medical {{restraints}} which are widely used. For example, the use of bed rails is routine in many hospitals and other care facilities, as the restraint prevents patients from rolling out of bed accidentally. Newborns frequently wear mittens to prevent accidental scratching. Some wheelchair users use a belt or a tray <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from falling <b>out</b> of their wheelchairs. In fact, not using these kinds of restraints when needed can lead to legal liability for preventable injuries.|$|R
