40|$|Water is {{most widely}} {{existing}} liquid in the earth; beyond all question, {{it takes a}} very important role in human daily life and many applications in industrial field. The heat transfer phenomena have drawn a great attention in the past decades. In the thesis, classical molecular dynamic simulations are carried out to study thermal and dynamic properties, including thermal conductivities, specific heat capacity, and shear viscosity. Though water molecule only has three charged atoms, but a number of water molecule models exist in the literature field. In this thesis, several rigid water molecule models are selected to perform the simulation. Then a non-equilibrium molecular dynamic is conducted to study nano-bubble growth and annihilation in the liquid water with rigid TIP 3 P. A nano-bubble is successfully generated, and pressure and surface tension of the bubble is obtained. Contact angle of a water droplet is also getting attention from micro-cooling engineers. A non-equilibrium molecular dynamics on contact angle of nano-size water droplet on a single wall carbon nanotube plate is performed. The gap distance between nano-tube affects the contact angle somehow, and a critical distance value that achieve largest contact angle is found. Rapid boiling phenomena of thin water film on a hot copper plate is also studied due to its application in various industrial fields, such as laser cleaning, <b>thermal</b> <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer,</b> medical surgery. The entire process of the boiling phenomena is observed, and a piston-like motion of the film is analyzed. To the end, due to the size limitation of classical molecular dynamics, a hybrid simulation coupling molecular dynamic and computational fluid dynamic is developed to extend the simulation size to micron based on open-source code LIGGGHTS and OpenFOAM. Heat transfer coefficient between argon flow and cold copper plate is studied and it is found that heat transfer coefficient can reach a very high value. In the future work, argon fluid could be replaced with normal liquid water mol...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{piezoelectric}} drop-on-demand <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer</b> {{has been}} used to build three-dimensional structures by direct deposition of alumina ink containing sub-micron ceramic particles suspended in an alkane wax. Inks containing up to 40 % v/v alumina were used to produce cubes in which support structures were made from paraffin wax. The fabrication process consists of the sequential deposition of layers of the ceramic suspension by the <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer.</b> This organic vehicle was removed by capillary action in a powder bed followed by pyrolysis before sintering the alumina product. Ink-jet deposition results in the formation of a solid structure after droplet impact and solidification. The distribution of alumina in the solid deposit has been studied and correlated with measurements of shrinkage during the dewaxing and sintering stages. A slight anisotropy is observed in that shrinkage in the z axis is greater than for the in-plane directions...|$|R

Introduction Several physical phenomena influence colours reproduced by <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers.</b> This makes accurate colour prediction very difficult. The dot gain effect is generally considered to have the largest impact on colour deviations. Dot gain is caused by light scattering or by ink spreading or both together.

40|$|Traditionally, {{positive}} transparencies for photogravure {{intaglio printing}} and negative transparencies for platinum and carbon-tissue transfer printing were produced from photographic film, providing continuous tone images of great detail, tonality and delicacy. Some {{of the finest}} photographic images {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century were printed using these processes and over the last decade an increasing number of artists have been attracted to the expressive possibilities of these techniques. Choice of film stock for the production of the necessary transparencies has become much more limited over recent years and digitally produced negatives and positives from image-setters and <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers</b> are increasingly favoured. The production of transparencies of a modest quality using <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers</b> and commercially available acetate film is not difficult. However, comprehensive calibration routines are necessary if full control over tonal gradation and print contrast is to be secured, especially in the highlight and shadow areas. Each type of photosensitive coating/process responds differently to the type and spectrum emissions of ultra-violet lamp used for exposure and to the nature of the transparency substrate and the colour/composition of the <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printer</b> inks. The ink colour and UV absorbance of the negative transparency, or positive in the case of photogravure, can be varied to give enhanced control over reflectance density, tonal gradation and micro-contrast in the final print. This illustrated talk will compare different techniques for the production of and calibration of ink-jet transparencies and the requirements for control of tonal gradation and contrast in respect of platinum, photogravure, carbon transfer and other photographic contact printing processes. The talk is complemented by a conference exhibition of some of Peter Moseley’s photogravure portraits...|$|R

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in printable large-area electronics [1, 2], {{it is not a}} fanta-sy anymore to print macroscopic-level organic ICs by <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printers.</b> To proto-type the organic circuits for the higher integration level, we propose User Customizable Logic Paper (UCLP). The UCLP can be easily customized by the user and operated in a speed for educational purposes that one can see how the circuit operates with one’s naked eyes.
