In the <b>tension</b> <b>building</b> <b>up</b> to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.|$|E

50|$|Their {{work done}} in Bristol, the convoy sets off again, and splits in two; half of them follow the cattle truck to Cirbury for the summer {{solstice}} performance, and the rest go to Stonehenge. The Brigadier receives new orders at last; the government will not tolerate the vandalism of a national monument, and UNIT must keep the travellers out of the circle. Only Mike Yates thinks to wonder why the government didn't give any orders to intervene after the murders. He's still somewhat disoriented by the beating he took in the cemetery, and perhaps that's why he's the only one unaffected by the <b>tension</b> <b>building</b> <b>up</b> amongst the UNIT troops. Even Benton and the Brigadier seem {{to be affected by}} it; when Corporal Robinson urges them just to open fire on the convoy, neither of them questions this blatant insubordination. Yates suggests sending a squad to Cirbury, as the band has always been at the centre of the disturbances, but the Brigadier refuses, insisting that the enemy is here, at Stonehenge. Certain that something's wrong, Yates disobeys orders and takes a group of soldiers to Cirbury. Nobody even notices them go.|$|E

Village poets and balladeers composed anti-Hindu poems and rhymes, which they recited and sang in market places and other public gathering places.|$|R
5000|$|In 1869, amid <b>tensions</b> <b>building</b> <b>up</b> between {{factions of}} women's rights activists, Foster spoke {{out at a}} {{national}} meeting of the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) to accuse Elizabeth Cady Stanton of advocating [...] "Educated Suffrage"—the right of upper-class white women to vote. Foster implied strongly that Stanton should step down as president of AERA. Henry Brown Blackwell tried to calm the waters by saying that all present, including Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, believed in [...] "negro suffrage". Frederick Douglass widened the gap when {{he stood up and}} stated his position against Stanton's use in her address of the pejorative term 'Sambo'. The words of Foster and Douglass served to define a major split which separated women's rights activists into two camps; those like Stanton and Anthony who felt that educated women deserved the right to vote before or {{at the same time as}} uneducated men, and those like Stone, Douglass and Foster who felt that the political situation called for a drive to achieve suffrage for the African-American man, followed by a new focus on suffrage for women of all races.|$|R

By this stage, Usmani was operating underground under the nom de guerre of Sikander Sur; his Comintern code name was D A Naoroji (sometimes wrongly rendered as Naoradji).|$|R

The fastest growth in the sector of industry is due to construction whereas in the services sector – to financial mediation. Such a discordance could not continue in the future, so structural adjustments linked to the overall tuning of the economy, are both possible and probable. The {{second part of the}} article studies the changes in inflation rates, employment and income. A clear positive trend of inflationary pressures emerges, which is in line with the positive development of real income of households per capita. Material and financial resources are tied up in unproductive projects which pushes domestic demand further but the latter is not met structurally by a corresponding supply. The subject of the third part is financial mediation. The lending provided by the banking system is still being held at an unreasonably high level which does not correspond to the structural characteristics of demand. In the end some conclusions are drawn for the inner structural <b>tensions</b> <b>building</b> <b>up</b> in the economy, accompanied by intensifying disequilibrium.

This included Dolly’s Brae, which {{was known as the}} site of a sectarian murder of a Catholic {{at the beginning of the}} century. The Orangemen’s compliance brought taunts of cowardice from Catholic Ribbonmen, who had even composed a song about the affair. The Orangemen were determined to march their traditional route the next year. It had become a point of honour for them.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} Bulgarian economy situation by 2008, analysed {{in terms of}} some evolving inner tensions and disbalances. The individual elements’ dynamics of GDP is traced in the first part, illustrating how the economic expansion {{of the last decade}} is to be attributed to the imports of goods and services. GDP growth is predetermined by domestic demand. A steady overtaking growth at a sectorial level is recorded by an element called “adjustments” which is filled by indirect taxation. The fastest growth in the sector of industry is due to construction whereas in the services sector – to financial mediation. Such a discordance could not continue in the future, so structural adjustments linked to the overall tuning of the economy, are both possible and probable. The second part of the article studies the changes in inflation rates, employment and income.

2500|$|On November 23, 1923, Urmuz shot himself, {{an event}} which remains {{shrouded}} in mystery. His death {{occurred in a}} public location, described as being close to Kiseleff Road in northern Bucharest. Some early sources suggest {{that he may have}} been suffering from an incurable disease, but he is also argued to have been fascinated with guns and their destructive potential. In 1914 for instance, he wrote down in his papers a homage to revolvers, crediting them with a magical power over the suicidal brain. Reports also show that he was theorizing the purposelessness and hollowness of life, addressing his fears on the subject to family members during the funeral of his brother Constantin (also in 1914). Researcher Geo Șerban wrote about Demetrescu-Buzău's well-hidden disappointment, assessing that, during his final year, the writer continued to act cheerful and relaxed, but that a [...] "devastating" [...] <b>tension</b> was <b>building</b> <b>up</b> inside him.

500|$|Next {{came the}} action {{sequences}} {{and the battle}} for the Enterprise, a phase the filmmakers dubbed [...] "Borg Hell". Frakes directed the Borg scenes similar to a horror film, creating as much suspense as possible. To balance these elements he added more comedic elements to the Earth scenes, intended to momentarily relieve the audience of <b>tension</b> before <b>building</b> it <b>up</b> again. Leonetti reconfigured the lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors. [...] "When the ship gets Borgified, everything is changed into more of a squared-off, robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images," [...] he explained. To give the corridor walls more shape, Leonetti lit them from underneath. Since the halls were so small and the ceilings would be visible in many of the shots, special attention was paid to hiding the light fixtures.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of The Late Show in January 1989, there was some scepticism {{as to whether or}} not the programme, running four nights per week on BBC Two in a late night slot after Newsnight, would be a success. In a feature for The Times {{newspaper}} on television arts coverage, published two months prior to the show's launch, Brian Appleyard wrote that: [...] "the real <b>tension</b> is <b>building</b> <b>up</b> around The Late Show and its young creator, Michael Jackson." [...] Appleyard pointed out that: [...] "the investment financial, intellectual and egotistical in the programme is enormous... Yentob is determined to put his own cultural stamp on BBC2 and Jackson has everything to prove." [...] However, the programme went on to be a success, running for six years. Looking back at The Late Show and other television arts programming in a feature for The Guardian in 2003, David Herman felt that the programme represented the last great era of television arts coverage. [...] "The Late Show cast its net wider in terms of formats... What drove it was the enthusiasm and passions of its presenters, producers and editors, and this built a certain eclecticism and unashamed highbrowness into its agenda... It could be argued that the real high point of intellectual life on British television was not the 1960s or the 1970s, but the decade between the beginning of Channel 4 and the end of The Late Show in 1995." ...|$|R

Pop!, who concluded, [...] "Death Do Us Part does a fairly good job of <b>building</b> <b>tension</b> <b>up</b> between the characters and establishing subplots and drama between them, but once it becomes a horror film the whole thing unravels and quickly becomes a directionless mess. The characters {{do a lot of}} pointless running around and screaming for no apparent reason, and it becomes very tedious until the last ten to fifteen minutes. I was ready to divorce this movie until the final twist was revealed. The ending has a surprisingly nasty edge that somewhat redeems the movie, but doesn't quite make up for the lack of direction and poor script". In his coverage of Death Do Us Part for the Canadian Film Review, Mark Weeden called the picture a hackneyed affair that was devoid of fright, but full of boring kills, cringe-worthy attempts at emotion, and [...] "Huh?"-inducing plot developments.
