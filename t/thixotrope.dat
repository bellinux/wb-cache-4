40|$|There {{were studied}} six {{variants}} of type suspension gels with 1. 5 % propiconazole nitrate, with various ointment bases: 4 % hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC-H), polyethylene glycol modified base and hydrated cetylic alcohol base, using as wetting agent and permeation enhancer glycerol {{as well as}} propylene glycol. The aim {{of this research is}} the physico-chemical characterization of gels: aspect, pH, homogeneity, rheological behaviour, viscosity and antifungal activity. The formulas based on HPC-H 4 % have a plastic behaviour and an increased yield value; the formula sbased on modified PEG are rheopectic type, having a higher degree of thixotropy generated by propylene glycol. The formulae on hydrated cetylic alcohol base have a <b>thixotrope</b> behaviour (the formula including glycerol as wetting agent) and respectively <b>thixotrope</b> â€“ antithixotrope behaviour (the formula including propylene glycol). The values of viscosity are higher in case of gel formulas having propylene glycol as wetting agent. Propiconazole nitrate has a good antifungal activity against clinical isolates of Candida spp., including strains resistant to other antifungal agents. All tested propiconazole nitrate gels have similar activity against Candida spp...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008052099 A 1 UPAB: 20100430 NOVELTY - The element has elastically {{deformable}} knot like elevations (2) arranged at {{an outer}} surface. Upper {{surfaces of the}} elevations are spherically curved in a region staying in contact with an adhering body (5). The elevations are made of a substance including viscous-elastic, <b>thixotrope</b> and/or elastomer characteristics. The elevations and/or a support layer (1) are permeably or semi-permeably designed in area by area for a medium. A medium guiding system transports the medium. An additional layer is provided on the elevations and/or the support layer. USE - Medium applying element for integrated in textile/flex materials (claimed) i. e. clothes, of a human or animal body to apply medium to a surface of a human or animal body. Uses include {{but are not limited}} to apply fluid e. g. solution and electrolyte, emulsion, colloid and gas to a surface of the human or animal body, for receiving and delivering a signal, for monitoring a pressure, volume and temperature in a device and a machine, for reversible, dosable transport of nanoparticles, for treatment of pain, for detoxification, for photodynamic therapy, for measuring a vital parameter, for transcutaneous monitoring of blood glucose and for peritoneal dialysis. ADVANTAGE - The element permits dosable accurate medium exchange with surface of the human or animal body, and ensures stable and small transition resistance to the human or animal body...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to execute a {{bottom-up}} design of the intrinsically self-healing nanocomposites. We briefly introduced the self-healing materials in chapter 1, covering classification and basic self-healing mechanism. In chapter 2, we have synthesized polyborosiloxane (PBS) according to the last century recipe as the self-healing supramolecular matrix. Additionally, we provided the long existing recipe with exclusive supplementary details, such as reaction kinetics, structural refinement and characterization, mechanical performance, glass transition temperature, etc. We have denoted the refined PBS, in which the end groups of PBS primarily exhibit in the well-defined borono structure (B(OH) 2), rPBS. In chapter 3, the molecular interaction of PBS molecules {{that leads to the}} self-healing behavior was investigated with modern techniques. Besides the well-known physically cross-linked H-bonds, PBS molecules also cross-link via forming reversible covalent boroxane structures (B-O-B). Chapter 4 and 5 focus on the reinforcing effects of rigid nanoclay particles (Cloisite 20 A) and flexible graphene oxide (GO), respectively. As PBS molecules bear the hydrophilic borono end groups, the incorporation of natural clay and graphene oxide leads to softened nanocomposites due to their hydrophilic surfaces. GO platelets efficiently drive the GO/rPBS nanocomposite into thixotropic material readily at a mass fraction of 0. 001. However, natural clay surface is not as hydrophilic as GO. The softening effect is not only less pronounced, but also quickly compensated due to the formation of the particle network. Nevertheless, it results in a paste-like <b>thixotrope</b> when the mass fraction of natural clay reaches 0. 6. Cloisite 20 A and OMGO are surface modified natural clay and GO, with almost the same alkyl modifier. They behave as ordinary reinforcement additives and may efficiently enhance the rheological properties of the nanocomposites. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|E
