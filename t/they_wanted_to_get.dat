5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party {{to a series of}} fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the album's creation each Weezer member asked themselves what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the album. With that in mind, they set out to record. Recording was done in three sessions. Half of the album was recorded during the spring of 2007 with Rick Rubin overseeing production. The second session, started in July and finished on October 18, was produced by Weezer themselves at Malibu. The third and final session of recording was done at the request of Geffen Records, who claimed that there was not enough commercial material on the album. This session was produced by Jacknife Lee and completed in March 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some more complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, they just wanted a fuller sound and liked the way Eddie played.|$|E

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew {{that the only way to}} get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E
500|$|While Green Day {{was nearing}} {{completion}} of Warning, the band {{announced it would}} be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album's October release. Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular at that time. I think they did the Warped tour because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> popular again." [...] He also went on to call Warning [...] "probably their worst album, I think. It's what happens, the ups and downs." [...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn't matter. [...] We thought Warning was one of their best records." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 39th PBA season, Barako Bull was the subject of all the {{criticism}} from league pundits and social media, because of the questionable personnel moves made during the off-season.

[...] They also traded away all their three first round picks for established veterans, which team manager Raffy Casyao considers as team strategy. [...] Casyao explained that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> quality, tried and tested veteran players that can give them some impact right away, as opposed to rebuilding the team with rookies from the ground up. [...] As a result of these offseason moves, they lost Danny Seigle to free agency, and added loads of veterans Dennis Miranda, Rico Maierhofer, Willy Wilson, Willie Miller, Robert Labagala, and Dorian Peña. [...] They also drafted ex-UST stalwart Jeric Fortuna and Benildean star Carlo Lastimosa.|$|E

2500|$|When Mr. Swilling {{first saw}} Escalante, he boasted {{to his friends}} {{that he was going}} to marry her. Eventually, they met and fell in love. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, however her mother objected, after all Mr. Swilling was 34 years old and Escalante was a young lady of 17 years of age. They then decided to elope. They lived {{together}} unmarried in the area of Tucson until April 11, 1864. That day Father Aloysius M. Bosco came to Tucson's St. Augustine's Cathedral, as was his custom, to baptize Mexican children, and to confirm Catholic marriages. Mr. Swilling and Escalante were married. It was a time when there were few White women on the southwestern frontier. It was not unusual for White men to marry Mexican or Native American women for companionship. During the course of their marriage the couple had seven children: Georgia, 1865; Matilda, 1867; Leila (Lilly), 1871; Elizabeth, 1873; Berry, 1874; Matilda Adeline, 1876; and John William, Jr., 1878.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Chiang Kai-shek {{became the}} de facto leader of the KMT. Chiang led the Northern Expedition through China {{with the intention of}} defeating the warlords and unifying the country. Chiang received the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists; however, he soon dismissed his Soviet advisors. He was convinced, not without reason, that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the KMT (also known as the Nationalists) and take over. Chiang decided to strike first and purged the Communists, killing thousands of them. At the same time, other violent conflicts took place in the south of China where the Communists fielded superior numbers and were massacring [...] Nationalist supporters. These events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and Communists. Chiang Kai-shek pushed the Communists into the interior as he sought to destroy them, and moved the Nationalist Government to Nanjing in 1927. Leftists within the KMT still allied to the communists had established a rival Nationalist Government in Wuhan two months earlier, but soon joined Chiang in Nanjing in August 1927. By the following year, Chiang's army had captured Beijing after overthrowing the Beiyang government and unified the entire nation, at least nominally, marking the beginning the Nanjing Decade.|$|E
2500|$|The event {{featured}} seven professional wrestling matches {{with different}} wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the [...] "bad guys") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the [...] "good guy" [...] characters) as they followed {{a series of}} tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

During a CMLL press conference on March 21, 2013 long time rivals Atlantis and Último Guerrero talked about their rivalry and then proceeded to sign a match for a Lucha de Apuestas but with no specific date mentioned. A Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match, is the most prestigious match form in Lucha Libre and means that the participants put their wrestling mask on the line and the loser will be forced to remove it after the match and never wrestle wearing it again. The act of signing a Luchas de Apuestas match between two of the top ranked CMLL workers without announcing a specific date has let people to speculate that it would take place at the 80th Anniversary show. CMLL officials explained that due to various prior commitment both in Mexico and in Japan and the United States they were not sure when the Lucha de Apuestas match could take place, but <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the contract signed first and then figure out the schedule. The two rivals found themselves on opposite sides in the semi-finals of the 2013 Gran Alternativa tournament. The tournament saw Atlantis team up with rookie Hombre Bala, Jr. while Último Guerrero teamed up with Guerrero Negro, Jr.. After both teams won their first two matches the semi-finals saw Atlantis and Hombre Bala, Jr. defeat the two Guerreros to earn a spot in the finals of the tournament. In the week following his tournament victory Atlantis was quoted as saying that [...] "Último Guerrero would look good in my trophy case". During the celebration of Atlantis' 30th anniversary as a wrestler Guerrero appeared after a match to berate Atlantis, which turned out to only be a distraction for the real Último Guerrero to attack Atlantis from behind. The two identically dressed Guerreros proceeded to beat up Atlantis and tear his mask apart. Following the match Último Guerrero introduced his brother [...] "Gran Guerrero".|$|E
