We present a structure function analysis, i. e., measure the power distribution over a range of <b>timescales</b> tau, of 13 AGNs to constrain the origin of UV/optical emission. On <b>timescales</b> tau approx. 5 - 60 days, the mean UV and optical power density spectra (PDS) are equivalent. This may suggest that the underlying energy generating mechanism is identical. The combined W/optical PDS is P(f) proportional to f(sup -alpha) - with alpha = 2. 13 (sup + 0. 22, sub - 0. 06). For sources with measured X-ray PDS indices, we find they are indistinguishable from their UV/optical counterparts.

The variability on synoptic–intraseasonal <b>timescales</b> is treated as stochastic noise {{that acts as a}} forcing function for variability at ENSO <b>timescales.</b> The spatial structure is computed that the stochastic noise forcing must have in order to enhance the variability of the system on seasonal–interannual <b>timescales.</b> These structures are the so-called stochastic optimals of the coupled system, and they bear a good resemblence to variability that is observed in the real atmosphere on synoptic and intraseasonal <b>timescales.</b> When the coupled model is subjected to a stochastic noise forcing composed of the stochastic optimals, variability on seasonal–interannual <b>timescales</b> develops that has spectral characteristics qualitatively similar to those seen in nature.
