5|$|Richmond {{grew up in}} Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (née Warner) Richmond, met in {{the course}} of their work. Al was a welder for pipe {{construction}} companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E
5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

Predatory pulmonate land slugs, such as the ghost slug, use elongated razor-sharp teeth on the radula to seize and devour earthworms. Predatory cephalopods, such as squid, use the radula for cutting prey.|$|E
25|$|At the new City station {{there were}} two {{platforms}} and either {{could be used by}} an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The track connections at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving. The left hand platform line was extended by a train length and trains could be stabled in the extension. A large diameter Greathead shield was used <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> the section of tunnel where the track connections would be installed.|$|E
25|$|The New English Bible was {{produced}} primarily by British and European scholarship (for example, Whitsuntide is rendered in 1 Corinthians 16:8 rather than Pentecost). However, directly following the Second World War the English of the United Kingdom and Europe {{began to be}} influenced by foreign idiom, especially that of the Americans. For this reason, passages found in the New English Bible could be understood by a large body of English speaking individuals. The British publisher and author Adam Nicolson, in his 2003 book on the King James Bible, criticized the newer translation for its 'anxiety not <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> or intimidate'.|$|E

50|$|The river {{section of}} the tunnel was {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>bored</b> tunnels on both banks. The tubes were then covered over in the trench by 4 to 20 ft of mud. Because the tunnel essentially sits on the river bottom, {{there is a wide}} no-anchor zone enforced on river traffic.|$|R
25|$|The steel support {{structures}} {{are attached to}} concrete foundations with partially threaded steel rods in conduits. These conduits {{were supposed to be}} filled with concrete grout after installation. Some of these voids were temporarily closed at the top with a concrete seal. Later workers incorrectly interpreted some of these locations as having been grouted when they were only sealed at the very top. Incomplete grouting can lead to salt-water intrusion that will accelerate corrosion of these critical rods. It is planned <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> small holes into the grouting to determine which locations require additional grouting or an alternative, injection of oil or similar material, to displace any water.|$|E
25|$|The west tunnel was {{the most}} {{difficult}} of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) that took over four years <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2inches per 100 linear feet (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman Portal site and submerged the TBM. It took four months to restore operations {{in the aftermath of the}} flooding.|$|E
25|$|From June 1977 onwards Bore Star {{served on}} the Helsinki—Stockholm route. In the {{beginning}} of the year 1979 Steamship Company Bore changed its name <b>to</b> <b>Bore</b> Line. At this time passenger numbers on the Baltic Sea were raising rapidly and Finland SS Co (which had changed its name to Effoa in 1976) and Svea were planning to build new ships for the Helsinki—Stockholm service. Bore wanted to concentrate on freight traffic and as a result the company sold its share of Silja Line to the other owners in July 1980, and Bore Stars ownership passed to Effoa. Forllowing the sale she was transferred to the Turku—Mariehamn—Stockholm service. In September of the same year the ship was renamed MS Silja Star. In January 1986 she was replaced by the new MS Wellamo and sold to Sea Containers.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two intermediate shafts. Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E
25|$|Modifications {{were made}} to a stub end tunnel (also known as the Penn Pocket, which was {{originally}} built for short turn World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs to handle PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal) to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> through the bedrock dividing the stub tunnel and the tunnels to and from Newark. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to/from Hoboken use separate tunnels from the Newark service. From Newark, trains cross over to the Newark/Hoboken bound track just north of Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. From Hoboken, trains enter on the Manhattan-bound track at Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used the same crossover switch {{to go to the}} Newark-bound tracks before entering Grove Street.|$|E
25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E
