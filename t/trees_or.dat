5|$|The limpkin {{is an odd}} {{bird that}} looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> scrub in the Caribbean, South America and {{southern}} Florida.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> against walls.|$|E
50|$|A parse <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> parsing <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> {{derivation}} <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> {{concrete syntax}} <b>tree</b> is an ordered, rooted tree {{that represents the}} syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical syntax, the term syntax tree is more common.|$|R

5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling on <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
50|$|Recall that a <b>tree</b> (<b>or</b> a forest) is irreductible when {{it lacks}} any {{internal}} node of degree 2. In {{the case of}} a rooted <b>tree</b> (<b>or</b> a rooted forest), the root(s) are of course allowed to have degree 2, since they are not internal nodes. Any <b>tree</b> (<b>or</b> forest) can be made irreductible by applying a sequence of edge contractions.|$|R
50|$|Cordyline indivisa is a monocot tree {{endemic to}} New Zealand, {{where it is}} called {{mountain}} cabbage <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> bush flax. It {{is also known as}} the Broad-leaved cabbage <b>tree,</b> <b>or</b> Tōī.|$|R
50|$|A burial <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> burial {{scaffold}} is a <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> {{simple structure}} used for supporting corpses or coffins. They were once common among the Balinese, the Naga people, certain Aboriginal Australians, and some North American First Nations.|$|R
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir <b>trees,</b> <b>or</b> among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young boys {{as well as the}} priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to the tops of <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> other high places. All of the tengu's victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or madness, {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, {{close to the}} body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers {{as in many other}} species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.|$|E

5|$|The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to {{be found}} in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting under a tree, on sand beds near rivers, in {{mountain}} caves, near waterfalls, in hollows inside <b>trees,</b> <b>or</b> in wide open fields. The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind, they are the Paramahamsas.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a lost of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up <b>trees</b> <b>or</b> other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab <b>trees)</b> <b>or</b> abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E
