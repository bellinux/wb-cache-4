5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} Buddhist story {{tells of}} Avalokiteśvara vowing never to rest {{until he had}} freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that still many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempts {{to reach out to}} all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.|$|E
25|$|Several Hindu stories present {{alternate}} {{aspects of}} Parvati, {{such as the}} ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali or Kali (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. <b>The</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.|$|E
25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hungry people {{and by the}} other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who {{had been sent to}} retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E

500|$|Mae West {{had already}} {{established}} {{herself as a}} comedic performer when her 1926 Broadway show Sex made national headlines. Tried and convicted of indecency by the New York City District Attorney, she served eight days in prison. West carefully constructed a stage persona and carried it over into her interviews and personal appearances. Despite her voluptuous physique, most of her appeal lay in her suggestive manner. She became a wordsmith {{in the art of}} the come-on and the seductive line, and despite her obvious appeal to male audiences, was popular with women as well. Over <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> censors, West got her start in the film Night After Night (1932), which starred George Raft and Constance Cummings, as a Texas Guinan-esque supporting character. She agreed to appear in the film only after producers agreed to let her write her own lines. In West's first line on film, after a hat check girl remarks [...] "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds", West replies, [...] "Goodness {{had nothing to do with}} it, dearie." [...] Raft, who had wanted Texas Guinan herself for the role that went to West, later wrote, [...] "In this picture, Mae West stole everything but the cameras." [...] She went on to make She Done Him Wrong in 1933, which became a huge box office hit, grossing $3 million against a $200,000 budget, and then nine months later wrote and starred in I'm No Angel. She became such a success that her career saved Paramount from financial ruin.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I aim at {{interpreting}} <b>the</b> project <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encyclical {{as a sort}} of paradigmatic turn in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> conceiving Christian faith.

In my view, by uniting <b>the</b> two categories <b>of</b> “nature/creation” and “poverty”, the encyclical implicitly builds an ideal bridge between Pope Francis’ paradigmatic turn and that “political turn” invoked by the Catholic theologian J. B. Metz from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixties through <b>the</b> proposal <b>of</b> a “New Political Theology”. Indeed, <b>the</b> excesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neo-liberal paradigm and <b>the</b> perverse effects <b>of</b> a certain organization of global market pushes Christianity to act by involving all social, cultural and religious actors, in order to fight against all <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> suffering and dehumanization of contemporary society.
