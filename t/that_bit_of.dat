Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|Former North Bay Centennials and University of New Brunswick star Bill Wright {{replaced}} Chris Cobb at UMass for the 2012–13 season, and {{his tenure}} {{has been marked}} by increased success both nationally and within the ECWHL. Wright inherited a strong team that already included the aforementioned stars, then added key freshmen Ally Perdios and Jess Greenwood, along with Penn State transfer Paige Harrington, to the fray. While that roster and 2011–12's surprise run didn't initially inspire confidence among rankings voters - the Minutemen began the year placed 14th, their second lowest position ever to start a season - they quickly converted doubters and, {{by the end of the}} regular season, were ranked second only to Liberty, a new program best. <b>That</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> history was made possible by another: UMass' first-ever ECWHL tournament title, thanks to a 2–1 title game win over defending ACHA national champion Northeastern. An impressive journey at the ACHA National Tournament in Ashburn, Virginia followed, with an opening 3–2 win over 2011 national champ Michigan State, as second-period goals from Oteri, Labossiere and Chelsea Bräm turned around an early 2–0 deficit. Although Northeastern took an ECWHL final rematch in the day one nightcap (the first day of the tournament involved two pool games played by each team at the time), two more Oteri goals delivered a vital 2–1 victory over Robert Morris (IL) that, along with tiebreaker help, sent UMass through to the semifinals for the third time in program history. Once there, however, eventual champ Minnesota jumped on the Minutemen for three goals in the first ten minutes of the contest en route to a 5–1 result.|$|E

[...] According {{to the first}} two games' writer Sam Lake, he [...] "did want to switch to Mona [...] but it was problematic. In the end, Max frames those {{sequences}} with his narration, saying that he doesn’t know exactly what happened, or what Mona did, {{but it must have}} been something like this. In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival at the end of Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story.

500|$|The song {{starts with}} an {{electric}} guitar riff comparable {{to the music of}} English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The [...] "restless" [...] beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept [...] "Ray of Light" [...] a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. [...] "She got frustrated when we were recording but you want <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't fake it, and you can hear it when she cracks it on the record," [...] he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, this was a link to the origin of the song from [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

Commenting on Steph's death she stated: [...] "No wonder that, gazing upon his face, she realised she was better off burning to death than enduring one more day staring at him." [...] She praised Paul Marquess' cast cull of 2010, but stated that Gilly is [...] "still hanging around like <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> dog mess you can’t get out of the grooves in your trainers." [...] She also opined: [...] "A damp drizzle of a character, Gilly hasn’t worked as Rhys’s wide boy sidekick, hasn’t worked as a loved-up hippy, hasn’t worked as a doting husband, doesn’t work on any level." [...] Also stating she wanted Hollyoaks serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) to kill him. Colin Robertson, writing for British tabloid newspaper The Sun brands Gilly a kind-hearted type character.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty.

George and Dot's great-grandson, also an artist named George, is at a museum {{unveiling}} his latest work, {{a reflection on}} Seurat's painting {{in the form of}} a light machine called [...] "Chromolume #7". George presents the work, grounding its connection to the painting by inviting his 98-year-old grandmother, Marie, to help him present the work. Marie shares her family history, describing how her mother, Dot, informed her on her deathbed that she was Seurat's daughter. George is skeptical of <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> family lore, but Marie insists that the notes in Dot's grammar book, which mention George, are proof.

2500|$|Holyfield's rematch with Tyson {{took place}} on June 28, 1997. Known as [...] "The Bite Fight," [...] it went into the annals of boxing {{as one of the}} most bizarre fights in history. The infamous {{incident}} occurred in the third round, when Tyson bit Holyfield on one of his ears and had two points deducted. Referee Mills Lane decided to disqualify Tyson initially, but after Holyfield and the ringside doctor intervened and said Holyfield could continue, he relented and allowed the fight to go on. Tyson bit Holyfield again, this time on the other ear. Tyson's teeth tore off a small section of the top of his opponent's ear, known as the helix, and spat <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> flesh out onto the canvas.|$|E

The park began as a cricket ground in 1903, and {{was due to the}} vision of one Harry Ryan, a cricket enthusiast who {{approached}} landowner John Walters to lease part of his land as a sports field. [...] In the book [...] Eden Park: A History, the authors write, [...] "Certainly the rough paddock strewn with stones, studded with outcrops of rock and streaked with cowpats, falling away to a boggy trough that filled in a downpour and remained flooded throughout the winter, looked better suited to frog-hunting or duck-shooting than cricket, let alone rugby.

2500|$|After {{the rank}} and file had left, Blamey {{addressed}} the officers. He questioned whether they were worthy of their men, and told them they must improve. Potts was initially dismissive about Blamey's address, when informed about it by Major Albert Caro. He passed on the news in a letter to Dawn; [...] "... apparently most of the troops take the speech as a colossal joke against the speaker..." [...] He did however write to Allen asking him to [...] "take the necessary action" [...] regarding Blamey's remarks. By the New Year he had been given further details and was enraged. Again writing to his wife; [...] "Hugh sent me a precis of his (T's) speech to the old team and to the officers. Hells Bells, it was a cowardly bit of work and untrue in every detail.

2500|$|In {{the final}} book, Voldemort flies unsupported, {{something}} that amazes {{those who see}} it. Voldemort, like his ancestral family, the Gaunts, is a Parselmouth, meaning he can converse with serpents. This skill was inherited from his ancestor, Salazar Slytherin. The Gaunt family speak Parseltongue among themselves. This highly unusual trait may be preserved through inbreeding, a practice employed by the Gaunt Family to maintain their blood's purity. When Voldemort attempts to kill Harry his ability to speak Parseltongue is passed to Harry through the small bit of the former's soul. After <b>that</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> soul is destroyed, Harry loses this ability. In a flashback in the sixth novel, Voldemort boasts to Dumbledore during a job interview that he has [...] "pushed the boundaries of magic farther than they had ever before". Dumbledore states that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is more extensive than any wizard alive and that even Dumbledore's most powerful protective spells and charms would likely be insufficient if Voldemort returned to full power. Dumbledore also said that Voldemort {{was probably the most}} brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. Although Voldemort remains highly accomplished and prodigious in skill, he is enormously lacking and highly inept in the most powerful magic, love. This inability to love and trust others proves to be Voldemort's greatest weakness in the series. Voldemort initially voices scepticism that his own magic might not be the most powerful, but upon returning to power, he admits to his Death Eaters that he had overlooked the ancient and powerful magic which Lily Potter invoked and that would protect Harry from harm.|$|E
