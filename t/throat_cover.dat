50|$|From C. A. L. Gunther (1864) The Reptiles of British India:Head {{covered with}} small, irregular, keeled shields above; canthusrostralis sharp; a small {{tubercle}} behind the superciliary edge; <b>throat</b> <b>covered</b> with small keeled scales; {{a series of}} small shields commences at the chin and runs backwards parallel to the lower labial shields. Tongue scarcely notched in front; two small canine teeth in each jaw; the upper with fifteen very small molars on each side, much smaller than those of the lower jaw, which arc sub-corneal and seventeen in number. A fold across the throat; male with a small gular pouch. Nape of the neck granular, with scattered larger tubercles. Both sexes with a nuchal crest, composed of triangular lobes; it is continued along the back as a slight serrated ridge, and gradually disappears on the anterior part of the tail. Trunk slightly compressed; the upper parts arc covered with smallish, keeled scales, intermixed with larger ones, all having their points obliquely directed upwards. Ventral scales strongly keeled, of moderate size; there arc about thirty-eight scales in a longitudinal series between fore and hind limb. All the scales of the tail are rhomboid and keeled, those on its lower side being the largest. The hind limb extends to the eye, if laid forwards; toes with keeled scales below; the fourth hind toe is one-fourth longer than the third. Back with alternate brown or black and grayish or yellowish-white cross bands which ascend obliquely backwards; head above variegated with black; a light, black-edged cross band on the inter-orbital space. A white or yellow band along the upper lip; another irregular band along each side of the neck, confluent with one of the light cross bands. Gular sac black behind; tail with broad brown or black rings.The colors, however, vary to a considerable extent in this species. A large female is almost wholly black above, variegated with yellow, all the larger scales being of the latter color. The characteristic bands on the head and side of the neck arc present. This species is a native of Sikkim; it attains to a length of 12 inches, the tail taking two-thirds of it.|$|R

30|$|Also {{hydrocarbon}} saturation in {{a reservoir}} is {{strongly related to}} PSD as capillary pressure, that is, for oil to accumulate in a geological trap and form a reservoir, the pressure in the oil phase must be higher than that in the water phase of reservoir. If the pressure in the oil is only slightly greater than that in the water phase, the oil will enter only large pores of PSD, but if the pressure within the oil phase is high enough, then oil saturation would be different where the oil can enter large pores in addition to narrow pores of PSD. Due {{to the absence of}} permeability measurements, permeability distribution function (PDF) was used instead to show qualitatively which group of the studied samples of the two formations is more permeable than the other one, based on pore <b>throat</b> range <b>covered</b> by the distribution.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{determine}} {{the role of the}} interplanetary magnetic field in controlling: (1) particle acceleration processes in the earth's polar cap; (2) plasma convection patterns at high latitudes; and, (3) the topology of magnetic field lines in the earth's polar cusps. The primary result of the study on polar-cap particle acceleration regions was that they tend to occur in only one polar cap at a time, and that they occur in the hemisphere for which the magnetospheric tail-lobe field lines have solar-magnetospheric x components that are antiparallel to those of the interplanetary and tail-lobe magnetic field. Southward-directed interplanetary magnetic fields give rise to broad convection <b>throats</b> which <b>cover</b> several hours of local time across the dayside cleft. Under such conditions, solar-wind plasma is channeled efficiently through the polar cusps to populate the plasma mantle and dayside boundary layer. On the other hand, the appearance of strong northward components in the interplanetary magnetic field result in a very constricted throat, resulting in inefficient plasma entry at the cusps by diffusion processes...|$|R

50|$|Young {{specimens}} are yellowish {{to light}} brown in colour, above and below, dorsally with dark scale margins forming {{a pattern of}} irregular transverse lines and a black band that circles the neck. As they mature into adulthood, this species gradually darkens to a darker brown colour, while the band on the neck fades away. The ventral scales are often yellow with dark brown blotches, and the <b>throat</b> band, which <b>covers</b> ventral scales 12-23, turns blue-black. A banded phase sometimes occurs in the most southern parts of the species' range, black with six to eight yellow bands on the body and one to three on the tail. The light bands are often as wider than the dark ones. This banded phase has been noted in roughly 13% of males and up to 22% of females. Although Branch claims that the banded phase is more common among males above 60 cm in length.|$|R
50|$|Women's {{everyday}} wear was ÅŸalvar (trousers), a gÃ¶mlek (chemise) {{that came}} down to the mid-calf or ankle, a short, fitted jacket called a hÄ±rka, and a sash or belt tied at or just below the waist. For formal occasions, such as visiting friends, the woman added an entari, a long robe that was cut like the hÄ±rka apart from the length. Both hÄ±rka and entari were buttoned to the waist, leaving the skirts open in front. Both garments also had buttons {{all the way to the}} throat, but were often buttoned only to the underside of the bust, leaving the garments to gape open over the bust. All of these clothes could be brightly colored and patterned. However, when a woman left the house, she covered her clothes with a ferace, a dark, modestly cut robe that buttoned all the way to the <b>throat.</b> She also <b>covered</b> her face with a variety of veils or wraps.|$|R

This {{was surrounded by}} short, velvety black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and <b>throat</b> were sparsely <b>covered</b> with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|R
50|$|This rockfowl {{measures}} around 38 to 41 cm in length, {{with its}} notably long tail contributing about 18 cm. Adult rockfowl show little sexual dimorphism in plumage and the sexes cannot be told apart by appearance. On the adult, the head, excluding the chin and throat, is completely bare of feathers {{except for a}} thin layer of fuzz on the forehead. The head's skin is bright yellow except for two large, circular patches of black skin located just behind the eye and containing the ear; only a thin, 2 mm wide patch of yellow skin on the crown prevents the two black patches from connecting. The black patch has a raised edge and appears to be a distinct part of the face. The eyelid and eyering are a thin line of black surrounding the bird's large, dark brown eyes. The beak is robust, disproportionately large, and black. This beak can be considered crow-like, is noticeably decurved in the upper mandible, and is about 30 mm long. The bird's chin and <b>throat</b> are <b>covered</b> in {{a thin layer of}} white feathers, and the neck is long and slender. The nape is also covered in white feathers, while the hindneck is nearly bare, revealing the orange-yellow skin. The upper mantle is a solid black, merging into a greyish-black lower mantle. The rockfowl's thighs are very muscular and aid its partially terrestrial lifestyle. The back, rump, and undertail are a bluish grey, while the tail is a dark brown and tented in shape. The moderately-sized wings are also a dark brown. The underparts are a creamy white and appear their creamiest in the upper breast. In dim light the white-necked rockfowl can appear to be solely black above and white below. The legs are blue and relatively long. Overall the plumage appears to be smooth with long feathers. The adult weighs 200 to 250 g.|$|R
