5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan).

He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E

The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They bring with them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black kitten to keep him company.
