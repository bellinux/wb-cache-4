5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate Highway standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate Highway standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Because of the fact that New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway41 (Bus. US41) {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway that}} served as a business loop off US41 and M-28 in Marquette, Michigan, along Washington and Front streets. The streets serve the downtown area of Marquette and are bordered by several commercial properties and businesses. Those two streets originate with the early founding of the city {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. Jurisdiction over them was transferred to the city as part of a highway swap that resulted in <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of the trunkline in 2005. It was also previously co-designated Bus. M-28, mirroring the Bus. US41/Bus. M-28 designation previously used along Bus. M-28 in Ishpeming and Negaunee. Washington and Front streets had been a part of the state highway system since the 1910s, and a part of the United States Numbered Highway System since 1926. The business loop designation dates back to the 1960s and was removed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.|$|E

5|$|Once {{considered}} {{a beautiful and}} impressive example of Route 66 architecture in Texas, the U-Drop Inn fell into disrepair with <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of Route 66. It closed for business in the late 1990s. After it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 1997, the building was purchased by the First National Bank of Shamrock, which then {{gave it to the}} city. Primarily funded by a US$1.7 million federal grant, the city hired a firm specializing in historical renovation to restore the building to its original glory and adapt it into a museum, visitors' center, gift shop, and the city's chamber of commerce. In 2006 animated film Cars, the cartoon village of Radiator Springs was based on multiple real U.S. Route 66 landmarks from Peach Springs to Baxter Springs; the U-Drop Inn's distinctive architecture appears as Ramone's automotive body and paint shop.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operated {{divisions in}} three separate areas {{during the period}} of 1965 to 1970. Twenty-six s with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the U.S. Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the South China Sea into South Vietnam by Viet Cong and North Vietnam junk and trawler operators. The squadron also provided naval gunfire support to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnamese coastline and assisted the U.S. Navy during Operation Sealords. As the United States' direct involvement in combat operations wound down during 1969, squadron crews began training Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVN) sailors in the operation and deployment of the cutters. The cutters were later turned over to the RVN as part of the Vietnamization of the war effort. Turnover of the cutters to South Vietnamese Navy crews began in May 1969 and was completed by August 1970. Squadron One was disestablished with <b>the</b> <b>decommissioning</b> of the last cutter.|$|E
