25|$|The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> was K'uk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed {{for four}} years {{starting}} in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed Casper by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Caspers sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore {{it is believed that}} there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants.|$|E

25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin {{and there is no way}} of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E
500|$|In January 2015 a {{transgender}} Jewish woman, Kay Long, {{was denied}} access to the Wall, first by the women's section {{and then by the}} men's section. Long's presence was prevented by [...] "modesty police" [...] at women’s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique. [...] "Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people. This is not the first story <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> with transgender religious people that {{wanted to go to the}} Western Wall and pray and couldn’t," [...] said Elinor Sidi, who expects that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the LGBTQ community will be a long and difficult one. It was later asserted that Kay Long would have been permitted in the women's section except for her clothing. [...] "It was not an issue of her gender, but the way she was dressed." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1925 Brooks had solo {{exhibitions}} in Paris, London, and New York. There {{is no evidence}} to substantiate the claim that Brooks ceased painting after 1925. [...] While in New York during the '30s she produced portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 Mureal Draper in 1938 <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of.</b> [...] We know that she purchased paints in WWII when she and Natalie were trapped in Florence. [...] As researchers, we know from photographs that there are lost works by Brooks still to be rediscovered. [...] After that year she produced only four more paintings, including portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 and Muriel Draper in 1938. [...] Moreover, Brooks did complete what previous scholars thought to be her last portrait at the age of 87 in 1961. [...] The artist stated that she had drawn all her life so {{there is no reason to}} assume she was not doing so by the time McAvoy painted her portrait. [...] In fact, she herself says in her audio interview from 1968 that she was miffed by the fact that McAvoy portrait of her showed a bunch of dried up brushes rather than the glass table she used as a palette [...] "As if I didn't paint." [...] Her comments seem to indicate she was anything but dried up as a painter. [...] In fact, she had intended to paint a portrait of McAvoy but he never had time to sit for her. [...] During the '30s she became the subject of literary portraits by three writers. [...] Each portrayed her as part of lesbian social circles in Paris and Capri.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1894 and 1897, Perry’s work {{achieved}} international acclaim. Not {{only was}} she able to exhibit {{her work in}} Boston, she also regularly exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts at the Salon de Champ de Mars during this time. In 1897 brought another exhibition for Perry at the St. Botolph Club, in which a Boston Evening Transcript critic said of her work, [...] "Mrs. Perry {{is one of the}} most genuine, on-nonsense, natural painters <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of...</b> Such paintings must be taken seriously." [...] Unlike her previous exhibition at the same location, this time Perry was exhibiting her works in a solo show. This exhibit featured the breadth of Perry’s artistic achievements up until this point including Impressionist portraits and landscapes.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Robert {{had married}} a woman named known only as Isabella by 1419, when he is also {{recorded}} as taking membership of the Durham confraternity. He also {{appears to have been}} friends with the Prior of Durham, John Wessington (with whom he dined at Durham Priory on at least one occasion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of)</b> who had not only granted him his letters of confraternity, but had been entrusted by Umfraville with important family title deeds. Umfraville had a certain religious devotion; in 1428, he was licenced to grant his manor of Farnacres, near Newcastle upon Tyne for the use of a chantry chapel, one of the few that was free-standing. This, he charged, should be devoted to the souls of himself, his wife, Kings Henry IV and V, and to each past, present and future member of the Order of the Garter.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the Massacre of the Innocents, {{although}} Herod {{was guilty}} of many brutal acts including the killing {{of his wife and}} two of his sons, no other contemporary source refers to the massacre. One reason that has been put forward for the lack of other sources for the alleged massacre is that Bethlehem was a small village, and thus the number of male {{children under the age of}} two might not have exceeded 20. Of recent biographers of Herod, most doubt the event took place, with one exception, Stewart Perowne, who deems the killing [...] "wholly in keeping with all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> him." [...] Other scholars such as Jack Finegan, A. Schalit, and Richard T. France support the historicity of the event, or at least state there is nothing impossible about this command from Herod.|$|E
2500|$|José 'Chicho' Ibáñez (Corral Falso, 22 November 1875 [...] Havana, 18 May 1981) was {{the first}} trovador (<b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of)</b> to {{specialize}} in the son and also on guaguancós and afrocuban rhythms from the abakuá. He played the tres rather than the Spanish guitar, and developed his own technique for this Cuban guitar. During his extremely long career, Chicho sang and played the son in streets, plazas, cafés, nightclubs and other venues throughout Cuba. In the 1920s, when the sextetos became popular, {{he was forced to}} sell his compositions to these larger groups and their composers in order to survive. His compositions include Tóma mamá que te manda tía, Evaristo, No te metas Caridad, Ojalá (sones); Yo era dichoso, Al fin mujer (bolero-sones); Qué más me pides, La saya de Oyá (guaguancos). He worked throughout Cuba, and latterly a short film was made of him ('See also' below).|$|E
