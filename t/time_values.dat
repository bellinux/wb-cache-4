2500|$|Representations {{can be done}} in one of two formatsa basic format with {{a minimal}} number of {{separators}} or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability. The standard notes that [...] "The basic format should be avoided in plain text." [...] The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the hyphen, while the colon is used as the separator between <b>time</b> <b>values</b> (hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as [...] in the extended format or simply as [...] "20090106" [...] in the basic format without ambiguity.|$|E

2500|$|Ragtime {{is not a}} [...] "time" [...] (meter) in {{the same}} sense that march time is 2/4 meter and waltz time is 3/4 meter; it is rather a musical style that uses an effect that can be applied to any meter. The {{defining}} characteristic of ragtime music is a specific type of syncopation in which melodic accents occur between metrical beats. This results in a melody that seems to be avoiding some metrical beats of the accompaniment by emphasizing notes that either anticipate or follow the beat ("a rhythmic base of metric affirmation, and a melody of metric denial"). The ultimate (and intended) effect on the listener is actually to accentuate the beat, thereby inducing the listener to move to the music. Scott Joplin, the composer/pianist known as the [...] "King of Ragtime", called the effect [...] "weird and intoxicating." [...] He also used the term [...] "swing" [...] in describing how to play ragtime music: [...] "Play slowly until you catch the swing...". The name swing later came to be applied to an early style of jazz that developed from ragtime. Converting a non-ragtime piece of music into ragtime by changing the <b>time</b> <b>values</b> of melody notes is known as [...] "ragging" [...] the piece. Original ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, four being the most common number. These themes were typically 16 bars, each theme divided into periods of four four-bar phrases and arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Typical patterns were AABBACCC′, AABBACCDD and AABBCCA, with the first two strains in the tonic key and the following strains in the subdominant. Sometimes rags would include introductions of four bars or bridges, between themes, of anywhere between four and 24 bars.|$|E
