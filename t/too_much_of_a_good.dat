25|$|The 1999 Cricket World Cup in England was one {{in which}} India were not {{expected}} to perform too well. Despite having the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and captain Mohammed Azharuddin in batting and Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad in bowling, they weren't having <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> run, losing to arch-rivals Pakistan in the finals of 2 consecutive triangular tournaments {{at home and at}} Sharjah. The format used for the tournament was slightly different from the 1996 format. Teams were divided into 2 groups of 6 teams each, with the top 3 teams in each group progressing to the Super Six stage, where a team belonging to one group in the Group stage would play once against all 3 teams belonging to the other group. India were placed in Group A in the Group stage along with hosts England, defending champions Sri Lanka, South Africa, Zimbabwe and minnows Kenya.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the {{challenge}} to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, [...] "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you {{need a lot of}} straight men... Let's not give them too much Jack. It's like too much dessert or <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing." [...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|Along with Jim Miller's {{opinions}} in Rolling Stone magazine, Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME {{was one of}} the most scathing critiques. Woffinden bemoaned how on Dark Horse, [...] "the radiant light of George's spirituality is planted firmly under a bushel and darkness is not confined to equine matters". He then wrote of the song: [...] " [...] seems to have most chance of independent survival, especially as the song turned up in quite pleasant shape on Wood's I've Got My Own Album To Do, but here again the production effectively smothers it, and Harrison's drab vocals complete the assassination." [...] By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: [...] "Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put." [...] In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse [...] "should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation" [...] but found the extended playout to [...] "Far East Man" [...] overlong – an example, he said, where [...] "you can have just <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing".|$|E

500|$|Drew McWeeny {{praised the}} film's {{complexity}} as giving it repeat-viewing value, and its conclusion as [...] "perhaps the most canny move it makes." [...] Todd Gilchrist found the story too {{similar to other}} cinematic trilogies such as Star Wars, but praised the production values. Brian Lowry felt that [...] "unlike last year's bloated sequel, it at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale." [...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there can indeed be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie {{to be one of the}} worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a non-event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining." [...] He praised the performances of the actors as one of the best things about the film.|$|E
2500|$|In part, {{the tension}} {{resulted}} from the historical coincidence of the first viable African American presidential candidate and the first viable woman candidate, running {{against each other in}} the same nomination race. One South Carolina pastor lamented that he had been waiting all his life for either [...] "first" [...] to happen and said, [...] "I really hate that they had to run {{at the same time in}} the same election. It just makes what should be a wonderful situation very stressful for folk like me. I never imagined you could have <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing." [...] After the Clinton-Obama tension on this matter, one Democrat said, [...] "After Iowa, Obama was the post-racial candidate who appealed to all of our better natures. Now he's a black politician, and she's a woman. And it is back to politics as usual." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{front-office}} woes {{affected the}} team {{regardless of who}} {{was brought in to}} coach. [...] After McKay stepped {{down at the end of}} the 1984 season, Leeman Bennett, who had coached the Atlanta Falcons to their first-ever playoff win, was hired. [...] After two disastrous 214 seasons, he was replaced by former New York Giants and University of Alabama head coach Ray Perkins. [...] Perkins brought back much-needed discipline and [...] "three-a-day" [...] practices, but it proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing. [...] The team was so physically drained by game day that the losses continued to pile up, and Perkins was fired before the end of the 1990 season. [...] Offensive coordinator Richard Williamson was elevated to head coach, and after his brief success in the final remaining games, he retained his head coaching position for the following year. [...] The momentum didn’t last, however, and was fired after the 1991 season when the team went 313.|$|E

2500|$|The Greatest Story Never Told {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 89, based on 13 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim [...] ". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated [...] "Told sometimes feels like <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing; at 18 furious tracks, it’s overwhelming {{in the best}} sense. Saigon’s background as an ex-con lends specificity and direction to his social criticism: He’s a battle-tested survivor singling out the injustices and hypocrisy of a world filled with prisons and traps, real and metaphorical. Told is worth the wait". In his review for The Village Voice, Phillip Mlynar complimented Saigon for his [...] "sincerity" [...] and [...] ability to offer advice to his listeners. Chad Grischow from IGN praised the album's themes and message, and wrote that [...] "it is the balance of uplifting, positive energy and gritty realism that makes this debut work so well". About.com's Henry Adaso gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and called it [...] "tight, visceral, consistent".|$|E
2500|$|The end of {{the decade}} brought {{professional}} setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was [...] "a brilliant and decisive – failure...t forces one to concentrate one's thoughts and increases one's courage...But the hissing was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing..." [...] At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner. Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt's followers, the so-called [...] "New German School" [...] (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School's leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the [...] "rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias". A draft was leaked to the press, and the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as backward-looking. Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "an extravagant and witty follow-up, {{made with the}} same {{friendly}} virtuosic dazzle… and just obligatory enough to be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing." [...] He cautioned that [...] "this time you can sense just how hard [...] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard." [...] Mike Ryan at Uproxx noted the continued {{sense of humor and}} tone from the first film, and appreciated Gunn's difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to The Empire Strikes Back). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly Rooker in his expanded role as [...] "the heart" [...] of the film. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film a [...] "blast" [...] and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that [...] "Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor… the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, writing, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch." [...] Roeper continued that [...] "even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with [...] "one of the best roles in the movie".|$|E
