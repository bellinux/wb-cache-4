5|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards's Dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.|$|E

25|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have claimed}} that Aymara is related to its more widely spoken neighbor, Quechua. That claim, however, is disputed. Although there are indeed similarities, like the nearly-identical phonologies, the majority position among linguists <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the similarities are better explained as areal features rising from prolonged cohabitation, rather than natural genealogical changes that would stem from a common protolanguage.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} already {{prevalent in}} the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard <b>today,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs; another, that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are generally also proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages and cultures.|$|E
25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{risk and uncertainty}} have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.|$|E

50|$|CGE {{modelling}} of richer economies descends from Leif Johansen's 1960 MSG {{model of}} Norway, and the static model developed by theCambridge Growth Project in the UK.

25|$|The {{prevailing}} academic opinion <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Israelites were {{a mixture}} of peoples predominantly indigenous to Canaan, although an Egyptian matrix of peoples may {{also played a role}} in their ethnogenesis, with an ethnic composition similar to that in Ammon, Edom and Moab, and including Hapiru and Šośu. The defining feature which marked them off from the surrounding societies was a staunch egalitarian organization focused on Yahweh worship, rather than mere kingship.|$|E
25|$|Defamation {{law in the}} United States is {{much less}} plaintiff-friendly than its {{counterparts}} in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to {{the enforcement of the}} First Amendment. One very important distinction <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> European and Commonwealth jurisdictions adhere to a theory that every publication of a defamation gives rise to a separate claim, so that a defamation on the Internet could be sued on in any country in which it was read, while American law only allows one claim for the primary publication.|$|E
25|$|However, another view, {{probably}} the most widely held <b>today,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the migrants were relatively few, centred on a warrior elite. They then dominated a process of acculturation to their own language and material culture. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land-use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry {{of the people of}} Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies tend to support this prediction.|$|E

25|$|The {{commonly}} held view <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the earliest {{settlement of the}} Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the Fosna culture in southern and central Norway and {{what used to be}} called the Komsa culture in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic Ahrensburg culture of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding glaciation at the end of the last ice age opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.|$|E
25|$|The Alhondiga {{only served}} its {{original}} function {{for eight months}} after it was built. The main reason for its importance <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{was the site of}} the first battle of the Mexican War of Independence between insurgents and royalist troops on 28 September 1810. When Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende and the insurgent army approached the city, royalist troops under Lieutenant Riaño and the city’s elite took refuge in the building, along with millions of pesos of silver and other loot. The insurgents quickly surrounded the building, but the building proved difficult to penetrate {{due to the lack of}} openings and royalist gunfire.|$|E
25|$|The {{sources of}} the many {{differences}} between the Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate and the Masoretic text have long been discussed by scholars. Following the Renaissance, a common opinion among some humanists was that the LXX translators bungled the translation from the Hebrew and that the LXX became more corrupt with time. The most widely accepted view <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the original Septuagint provided a reasonably accurate record of an early Hebrew textual variant that differed from the ancestor of the Masoretic text {{as well as those}} of the Latin Vulgate, where both of the latter seem to have a more similar textual heritage. This view is supported by comparisons with Biblical texts found at the Essene settlement at Qumran (the Dead Sea Scrolls).|$|E

25|$|The knife must be {{minimally}} {{slightly longer}} than the neck but preferably at least 2 times {{as long as the}} animal's neck is wide, but not so long that the weight of the knife is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause Derasah, excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal but the normative practice <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> shorter blades are not used. The knife must not have a point. It is feared a point may slip into the wound during slaughter and cause Haladah, covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause Iqqur, tearing.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{hypotheses}} for why ancient Mars was wetter than <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, {{to try to solve}} this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5 wt% calcite (CaCO3) at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates in the rim of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars. However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds less that the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust.|$|E
500|$|The {{war began}} at Fort Detroit under the {{leadership}} of Pontiac, and quickly spread throughout the region. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were unsuccessfully besieged. Francis Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac. Parkman's interpretation remains well known, but other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall [...] "conspiracy". The prevailing view among scholars <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> rather than being planned in advance, the uprising spread as word of Pontiac's actions at Detroit traveled throughout the pays d'en haut, inspiring already discontented Native Americans to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts were not simultaneous: most Ohio Native Americans did not enter the war until nearly a month after the beginning of Pontiac's siege at Detroit.|$|E

500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone will come {{up with the idea of}} spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E
