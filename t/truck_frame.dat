50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the <b>truck</b> <b>frame.</b> The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the <b>truck</b> <b>frame).</b> The <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|E

50|$|Annual {{production}} of the consolidated companies' factories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Joliet, Illinois was forecast to be 24,000 steel freight cars, 300,000 bolsters and 180,000 <b>truck</b> <b>frames.</b> It resumed railroad-car production after World War 2, but was merged and closed down in 1956.|$|R

50|$|On September 1, 1935, he {{accepted}} {{a position in}} the Electro-Motive Corporation (from 1941, it was renamed to Electro-Motive Division of General Motors). It was here Blomberg was given responsibility for the construction of locomotive bodies, frames and truck frames. The EMC E4 diesel-electric locomotive was mostly his design, including the three-axle (A1A) truck. In 1939 he designed the four-wheel flexible <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> from the three-axle version for the new diesel-electric freight locomotive called the EMD FT. This four-wheel <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> and its derivations were incorporated in more than 15,000 locomotives. Unofficially, but generally accepted, the two-axle trucks, Blomberg B and Blomberg M, are named after him. The two-axle AAR Type A switcher truck is also a Blomberg design.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{aims of the}} {{research}} are studies safety and exploitation conditions of weld structure reparation of car body <b>truck</b> <b>frames.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Structure of car body <b>truck</b> <b>frames</b> are the main object of {{the research}}. Impact toughness, fatigue properties were measured, fractographic analyses were made. Subject scopes are experimental research about weld structure reparation of car body <b>truck</b> <b>frames.</b> Theoretical calculations should {{be used as the}} hint automotive welding reparations. Findings: Optimization of operational properties of steel welded structures might be done in terms of the chemical composition (amount Mo, Mn) in WMD. Molybdenum should be treated as the element very positively influencing impact toughness and fatigue properties of low alloy WMD. The cause of damages and deformation of steel car body frame structures is often connected with no proper choice of welding materials, their joining technology, and chemical composition of WMD. Research limitations/implications: Studies on the effect of other important alloying elements on the properties of the frame of a vehicle should be continued. Practical implications: Practical implications might be improving of the passive safety of the vehicle by quality of the car structures reparations. Originality/value: A novelty is the analysis of the impact of major alloying elements in the weld on the quality of repair structural components of the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{exploitation}} and safety conditions of weld steel structure of car body <b>truck</b> <b>frames</b> after welding repairs made by covered electrodes. The main role of conditions in connected with materials, alloy elements in steel and filer materials, welding technology, state of stress and temperature. Because of that, good selection of steel and choice of welding method for proper steel structure repairs are very important. For responsible steel, structures like <b>truck</b> <b>frames</b> and low alloy steel are used, very often with small amounts of carbon and some amounts of alloy elements such as Ni and Mo in low alloy steel and their welds. To study the frame’s flexibility and resistance, welded joints have been analyzed. Samples have been welded by steel electrodes with various amounts of Ni...|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, mainstays of this output was the Model-10 {{which had the}} engine mounted up in the baggage compartment, as was the fashion of most all other manufacturers.

What set the Model-20 apart from the Model-10 and competitor's models was the ingenious, patented, power truck design, with the motor set into the front <b>truck</b> <b>frame</b> instead of being up in the car body.|$|E
50|$|Gun trucks {{suffered}} from several drawbacks. The added weight of armour, weapons and ammunition increased fuel consumption, {{as well as}} creating maintenance problems and reducing the durability of the <b>truck</b> <b>frames.</b> Also, the personnel assigned as crew to the security vehicles were no longer available for transport duties, thus reducing the lift capacity of each unit. Despite this, they were generally regarded as a success.|$|R
