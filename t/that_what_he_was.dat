25|$|Wheldon was knighted in 1976. Following his {{retirement}} from the BBC he became Chairman of the Court of the Governors of the London School of Economics, {{where he had}} read economics before the war. He disarmed potential sponsors of the school by eschewing flattery and opening negotiations with the bald statement <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> after was their cash. He was also a formidable and active President of the Royal Television Society (RTS). An RTS Memorial Lecture in his name by a distinguished broadcaster is televised annually. In 2011 Bettany Hughes gave the lecture, and Brian Cox gave the lecture in 2010. Other speakers have included David Attenborough, Jeremy Isaacs and, in 2005, the writer Paul Abbott. In addition to this, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) dispenses a Huw Wheldon Award for Specialist Factual Programme. There are also Wheldon bursaries and awards at the LSE and the University of Wales, Bangor.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through {{the glare of the}} stage lights, was worried that the crowd might {{be on the verge of}} rioting. It took him several minutes to realize <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of John Marston {{was developed to}} be a [...] "family man". The team developed him as a nuanced character, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience. Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. [...] "He was a man about things," [...] Wiethoff remarked. Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism. Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were [...] "wrong", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life. He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. [...] "I don't know if he knew <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong or not," [...] Wiethoff said.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, he is likely to be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion as to what to do.|$|E
500|$|Donen is {{credited}} with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals [...] such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley [...] were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers {{were part of a}} stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was a [...] "direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch... What we did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal." [...] Film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical [...] "outshines anybody else's, including Vincente Minnelli's." [...] He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E

[...] {{to the case of}} men on a ship, one of whom took a borer and began boring beneath his own place. His shipmates asked him what he was doing. He replied <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing would not matter to them, as he was boring under his own place. And they replied that the water would come up and flood the ship for them all.|$|E
2500|$|They parted in 1886. Their life {{together}} was a torture for Rozanov, as evident from his personal correspondence. Suslova made public scenes of jealousy and flirted {{with his friends}} at the same time. Rozanov's daughter, Tatyana, stated in her memoirs: [...] "Suslova mocked him, saying <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing were just some stupid books, she insulted him, and finally dumped him". Suslova broke up with Rozanov twice, but he always forgave her and begged to return home. After they finally parted, Rozanov admitted: [...] "There was something brilliant (in her temperament) that made me love her blindly and timidly despite all the suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the centennial}} of Escrivá's birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict XVI) commented: [...] "I have always been {{impressed}} by Josemaría Escrivá's explanation of the name 'Opus Dei': an explanation ... gives {{us an idea of}} the founder's spiritual profile. Escrivá knew he had to found something, but he was also conscious <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [...] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, {{it seems to me that}} he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{judges were}} {{specifically}} asked {{if a person}} could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, [...] "he {{must be considered in}} the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real". This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows Hadfield's Trial, above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. In R v Bell 1984 Crim. LR 685 the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because [...] "It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it" [...] as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, {{and the fact that he}} believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong in the legal sense.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trading}} {{deadline}} of July 31 approached, the Nationals {{were in a}} dilemma. On one hand, Soriano had initially expressed his distaste for playing left field, {{and he was in}} the last year of his contract, which would grant him free agency at the end of the season. If the Nationals lost Soriano at the end of the season, they would receive a first or second round draft pick from the team that signed him and a [...] "sandwich" [...] pick between the first and second rounds as compensation. Soriano did not want to engage in contract negotiations during the season. On the other hand, as the deadline approached, Soriano expressed his enjoyment with left field, and his strong desire to stay with the team. Both fans and players began to be more vocal in their support to keep Soriano. Manager Frank Robinson praised Soriano's leadership in the clubhouse, and further suggested that Soriano should be considered for MVP of the National League. There were plenty of suitors, including sending Soriano back to the Yankees, and the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers were also interested. In the end, Nationals general manager Jim Bowden felt <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> offered was not worth trading him. [...] The Nationals hoped to sign him to a long term deal before the season ended but on October 12, 2006 he rejected a $70M deal.|$|E
