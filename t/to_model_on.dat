2500|$|Infinite {{dimensional}} manifolds: [...] The {{definition of}} a manifold can be generalized by dropping the requirement of finite dimensionality. [...] Thus an infinite dimensional manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a topological vector space over the reals. This omits the point-set axioms, allowing higher cardinalities and non-Hausdorff manifolds; and it omits finite dimension, allowing structures such as Hilbert manifolds <b>to</b> be <b>modeled</b> <b>on</b> Hilbert spaces, Banach manifolds <b>to</b> be <b>modeled</b> <b>on</b> Banach spaces, and Fréchet manifolds <b>to</b> be <b>modeled</b> <b>on</b> Fréchet spaces. Usually one relaxes {{one or the other}} condition: manifolds with the point-set axioms are studied in general topology, while infinite-dimensional manifolds are studied in functional analysis.|$|R

50|$|When {{logic gates}} toggle, some {{transistors}} inside may change states. As this takes a finite amount of time, it may happen {{that for a}} very brief amount of time some transistors are conducting simultaneously.

The magnitude of this power {{is dependent on the}} logic gate, and is rather complex <b>to</b> <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a macro level.|$|E

Previous endeavors were unable to go beyond 30 quantum bits. As described in the scientific journal Nature, the capability of this simulator is 10 times more than previous devices.

Kironde launched her eponymous clothing line that focused on designing white shirts along with her husband, architect William Winder, in Boston.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the exact}} {{form of a}} dot gain curve is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>model</b> <b>on</b> the basis of geometry, and empirical modeling is used instead. To a certain extent, the models described above are empirical, as their parameters cannot be accurately determined from physical aspects of image microstructure and first principles. However, polynomials, cubic splines, and interpolation are completely empirical, and do not involve any image-related parameters. Such models were used by Pearson and Pobboravsky, for example, in their program to compute dot area fractions needed to produce a particular color in lithography.|$|E

Applications include the task of combining the output of multiple search engines and multiclass or multilabel classification, where a set of input classifiers is viewed as generating a ranking of class labels. Experiments for both types of applications are presented. 1...|$|R
