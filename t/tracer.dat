5|$|In {{addition}} to appearing in animations and comics based off the video game, <b>Tracer</b> has {{also appeared in}} Overwatch merchandising. In 2017, Japanese manufacturer Good Smile Company partnered with Blizzard to release Overwatch action figures in their Nendoroid and Figma lines, including figures of <b>Tracer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barium {{peroxide}} is {{a catalyst}} in the aluminothermic reaction (thermite) for welding rail tracks. It {{is also a}} green flare in <b>tracer</b> ammunition and a bleaching agent.|$|E

30|$|Many inter-well <b>tracers</b> {{have been}} widely used to monitor the {{displacement}} into reservoirs and to obtain information on the interaction between producer and injector. These include chemical <b>tracers</b> (Wang et al. 2004 b), nuclear <b>tracers</b> (Bjørnstad et al. 1990; Lien et al. 1988) and isotope <b>tracers</b> (Selby et al. 2007; Osborn and McIntosh 2010). However, some chemical <b>tracers</b> are easily absorbed onto the surface of rocks in the stratum, and the instruments required to detect radioactive isotopes are extremely expensive.|$|R
30|$|None of the {{secondary}} liver metastases were PET-positive {{for any of the}} two <b>tracers.</b> None of the <b>tracers,</b> however, reached a level of sensitivity for detection of hepatic tumors that would support their appropriateness as diagnostic PET <b>tracers</b> for HCC.|$|R
40|$|The stabilities {{of several}} <b>tracers</b> were tested under {{geothermal}} conditions while injection-backflow {{tests were conducted}} at East Mesa. The <b>tracers</b> I and Br were injected continuously while SCN (thiocyanate), B, and disodium fluorescein were each injected as a point source (slug). The <b>tracers</b> were shown to be stable, except where the high concentrations used during slug injection induced adsorption of the slug <b>tracers.</b> However, adsorption of the slug <b>tracers</b> appeared to ''armor'' the formation against adsorption during subsequent tests. Precipitation behavior of calcite and silica as well as Na/K shifts during injection are also discussed...|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. <b>Tracer</b> diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. <b>Tracer</b> diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tracer</b> (also {{known by}} her real name, Lena Oxton) is a player {{character}} {{appearing in the}} 2016 video game Overwatch, a Blizzard Entertainment–developed first-person shooter, and its related animated and literary media. <b>Tracer</b> is from the Overwatch universe, but she was introduced as a playable character in Blizzard's crossover multiplayer online battle arena game, Heroes of the Storm, in an April 2016 update.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tracer</b> {{diffusion}} {{describes the}} motion of individual adparticles on a surface at relatively low coverage levels. At these low levels (< 0.01 monolayer), particle interaction is low and each particle can be considered to move independently of the others. The single atom diffusing in figure 1 is a nice example of <b>tracer</b> diffusion.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{and application of}} PET <b>tracers</b> has been a unique step in the progress of nuclear medicine in last two decades. The most important PET <b>tracers</b> include F- 18, C- 11 and N- 13 radioisotopes and many nuclear medicine centers throughout the globe are using them. However some new <b>tracers</b> are under {{their way to the}} mass administration, currently being in the clinical trials or preliminary studies. Gallium- 66 and 68 <b>tracers</b> such as Ga-DOTANOC and Ga-DOTANIC are currently being used in many neuroendocrine tumor studies in human in Europe and North America, and global application of these <b>tracers</b> remain to the cheaper and easier providence of 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generators. Copper <b>tracers</b> such as 61, 62, 64 Cu-ATSM and 61, 62, 64 Cu-PTSM are the most important unconventional <b>tracers</b> used in hypoxia and perfusion studies respectively using PET technology. Copper <b>tracers</b> can easily be produced using a medium cyclotron with simple chemistry. Many other interesting PET radioisotopes such as Tc- 94 m (HL. 52 min), I- 124 (HL. 100 h), Y- 86 (HL. 14. 7) and rubidium <b>tracers</b> are being studied in some research centers in the world. This review article would describe the properties, mechanisms, production routes and problems of unconventional PET <b>tracers</b> with a look to the future of some important drug candidates...|$|R
30|$|Our {{relatively}} simple approach {{could be used}} in other clinical multicenter studies focusing on other diseases and <b>tracers,</b> provided that the assumptions of focal uptake and negligible background are fulfilled. This might be the case for other 124 I <b>tracers</b> and for 68 Ga, 18 F, and 81 Zr <b>tracers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Velocity {{measurements}} {{within the}} core of high-swirl vortices are often hampered by heavier-than-air particle <b>tracers</b> being centrifuged outside the vortex core region. The use of neutrally buoyant and lighter-than-air <b>tracers</b> is investigated to aim at homogeneous <b>tracers</b> concentration in air flow experiments dealing with high-swirl vortices using particle image velocimetry. Helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) of sub-millimeter diameter are employed as flow <b>tracers.</b> Their density is controlled varying the relative amount of helium and soap solution composing the bubbles. The dynamics of HFSB and micro-size droplets is modeled within a Lamb–Oseen vortex to retrieve the order of magnitude of the <b>tracers</b> slip velocity. A positive radial drift for heavier-than-air <b>tracers</b> leads to an empty vortex core. In contrast, the concentration at the vortex axis {{is expected to increase}} for lighter than air <b>tracers.</b> Experiments are conducted on a sharp-edged slender delta wing at 20 ° incidence. At chosen chord-based Reynolds numbers of 2  ×  10 5 and 6  ×  10 5, a stable laminar vortex is formed above the delta wing. Laser sheet visualization is used to inspect the spatial concentration of <b>tracers.</b> A comparison is made between micron-sized fog droplets and HFSB <b>tracers</b> in the nearly neutrally buoyant condition. Stereo-PIV measurements with fog droplets return a systematically underestimated axial velocity distribution within the vortex core due to drop-out of image cross-correlation signal. The nearly neutrally buoyant HFSB <b>tracers</b> appear to maintain a homogeneous spatial concentration and yield cross-correlation signal up to the vortex axis. The resulting velocity measurements are in good agreement with literature data. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1993, FN {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the SS190 cartridge. Several specialized 5.7×28mm varieties were also developed alongside the SS190, such as the L191 <b>tracer</b> round and the subsonic SB193 bullet for sound-suppressed use. The 5.7×28mm chambered FN Five-seven pistol then went into production in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Blizzard Entertainment geoblocked a tie-in web comic for its game Overwatch in Russia for {{containing}} {{a scene of}} the character <b>Tracer,</b> who was confirmed as being lesbian, kissing another woman. Blizzard cited the gay propaganda law as reasoning for the block. The game itself is not blocked in the country.|$|E
40|$|Fully {{automated}} radiosynthesizers {{are continuing}} to be de-veloped to meet the growing need for the reliable production of PET <b>tracers</b> made under current good manufacturing practice guidelines. There is a current trend toward supporting kitlike disposable cassettes that come preconfigured for particular <b>tracers,</b> thus {{eliminating the need for}} cleaning protocols between syntheses and enabling quick transitions to synthe-sizing other <b>tracers.</b> Though ideal for production, these systems are often limited for the development of novel <b>tracers</b> because of pressure, temperature, and chemical compatibility consid-erations. This study demonstrated the versatile use of the ELIXYS fully automated radiosynthesizer to adapt and produce 8 different 18 F-labeled PET <b>tracers</b> of varying complexity.

50|$|Alternatively {{strategies}} are transsynaptic anterograde <b>tracers,</b> which can cross the synaptic cleft, labeling multiple neurons within a pathway. Those {{can also be}} genetic or molecular <b>tracers.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Radioisotopes {{have been}} a useful tool in the stem {{injection}} technique [1 – 3]. It is applicable to investigate the movement of water, nutrients and metabolites in trees by labeling the target atoms or molecules. Unfortunately, the use of radioactive <b>tracers</b> {{in the field is}} nowadays restricted or not allowed. Instead, non-radioactive <b>tracers,</b> such as stable isotopes and activable <b>tracers,</b> are being the alternative.

5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail <b>Tracer,</b> a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail <b>Tracer</b> has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up their minds to ask the Rail <b>Tracer</b> to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail <b>Tracer</b> is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of hafnium and {{lutetium}} (along with ytterbium) {{are also}} used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications. It is often used as a <b>tracer</b> of isotopic evolution of Earth’s mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E

The fundamental ideas concerning <b>tracers</b> are described, followed by their application illustrated by typical examples. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} five classes among the most frequently used external <b>tracers</b> (fluorescent, microbial, chemical, radioactive and activable isotopes) are also described in detail. This review also presents some interesting and modern applications of <b>tracers</b> in the areas of diagnostics in medical practice, environmental pollution, hydrology and petroleum chemistry...|$|R
40|$|PET is an {{effective}} tool for imaging of biochemical processes within patients and is instrumental for quantitative imaging {{of the availability of}} opioid receptors in the central nervous system. The opioid receptor system is involved in many important pathologic processes within the body such as processing of pain and immunological responses. This master thesis contributes to the availability of PET <b>tracers</b> for the opioid receptor system by devising a 3 -step, 2 -pot automated method for synthesis of three 18 F-labeled opioid receptor system PET <b>tracers.</b> In addition to opioid receptor system PET <b>tracers,</b> this method can be used to label other PET <b>tracers</b> by [18 F]fluoroalkylation. The three opioid receptor system <b>tracers</b> produced in this study: 6 -O-[18 F]Fluoroethyl- 6 -O-desmethyl-diprenorphine, 6 -O-[18 F]Fluoroethyl- 6 -O-desmethyl-buprenorphine, and 6 -O-[18 F]Fluoroethyl- 6 -O-desmethyl-phenylethylorvinol are synthesized by automation {{for the first time on}} the same automated module. Automated production of the 3 structurally related opioid receptor system PET <b>tracers</b> allows for investigations of antagonist versus agonist properties previously impossible. Automation also allows for production of PET <b>tracers</b> under “Good Manufacturing Practice” (GMP) guidelines, decreases synthesis times, increases yields and quality, increases reproducibility, and increases the availability of PET <b>tracers</b> while lowering their cost of production...|$|R

5|$|<b>Tracer</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{recognizable}} Overwatch characters, having prominent roles in the game's official media, including promotional works and the game's cover art, as well as fan art. Her profile rose even more when the character was given additional media attention through online controversies—one surrounding one of her victory poses, and another surrounding her prominence in fan-produced pornography that Blizzard has made efforts to remove. Apart from the video game, <b>Tracer</b> has also made appearances in related animated media, and the Overwatch digital comic series. In her comic debut, she was revealed as a lesbian, a depiction that was met with positive reception from media outlets and players alike.|$|E
30|$|Both {{raclopride}} and GTP decreased striatal SBRs of all <b>tracers</b> {{significantly and}} to a similar extent, which was consistent across the homologous series (Table  3). This indicates that all our <b>tracers</b> specifically bind to striatal dopamine D 2 / 3 receptors in their G-protein-coupled “high-affinity state.” <b>Tracers</b> with a shorter alkyl chain showed higher in vitro autoradiography-based striatal SBR values (Et[*]>[*]Pr[*]>[*]Bu). These findings are in agreement with our hypothesis that varying the [18 F]fluoroalkyl chain length would influence non-specific binding, but not the D 2 / 3 R-affinity or agonism of the <b>tracers.</b>|$|R
30|$|Future {{development}} of tau <b>tracers</b> will require further evaluation of existing radiotracers, including preclinical characterisation, validation in the clinic, {{better understanding of}} uptake patterns in healthy controls, test-retest and human dosimetry data, and neuropathological correlations with PET, as well as head-to-head comparisons between different <b>tracers.</b> Improvement seems possible in the pharmacokinetic properties of 18 F-labeled <b>tracers,</b> binding selectivity, and experience in non-AD tauopathies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{laboratory research}} conducted {{to investigate the}} use of partitioning <b>tracers</b> for the detection, volume estimation, and remediation performance assessment of vadose zones contaminated by nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). These laboratory studies used Ottawa sand and field soil packed columns. The columns were saturated, then reduced to residual saturations of water and NAPL, creating a three phase system of air, water, and NAPL. Conservative and partitioning gas <b>tracers</b> were injected into the column and their elutions were analyzed. The method of moments was used to estimate partition coefficients between the air and NAPL phases {{for each of the}} <b>tracers.</b> The partition coefficients and retardation factors are used to select appropriate <b>tracers</b> for NAPL detection and volume estimation in the field. This research identified several perfluorocarbon <b>tracers</b> suitable for use in the field and demonstrated the feasibility of using partitioning <b>tracers</b> as a tool for NAPL detection and volume estimation in the vadose zone. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{chemical}} <b>tracer</b> is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is}} a stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive <b>tracer</b> and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common <b>tracer</b> is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E
