In the theoretical R&D literature, the most common stable R&D structure is a complete network (Goyal and Moraga-Gonzalez 2001; Goyal and Joshi 2003; Song and Vannetelbosch 2007; Deroian 2008; Westbrock 2010; Zu et al. 2011; Konig et al. 2012; Zirulia 2012).

The fact that 14 different countries have published articles on SAP indicates geographical dispersion as well as alignment with other approaches.

The companies that collaborate most with each other also exchange confidential information. There seems not to be a link between cooperation relationships and business relations. The companies with the most business links are not the ones that cooperate most with each other. The network of business relations is scattered and weak.

Although {{the game has}} been well studied in the OR literature, the fundamental question whether the agents can afford cooperation costs {{to set up and}} maintain the game in the first place has not been addressed thus far. This paper addresses this question for the cooperative transshipment games with identical agents having normally distributed independent demands. We provide characterization of equal allocations which are in the core of symmetric games, and prove that not all transshipment games are convex. In particular, we prove that though individual allocations grow with the coalition size, the growth diminishes according to two rules of diminishing individual allocations. These results are the basis for studying the games with cooperation costs. We model the cooperation costs by <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>network</b> topology and the cooperation cost per network link. We consider two network topologies, the clique and the hub, and prove bounds for the cost per link that render coalitions stable. These bounds always limit coalition size for cliques.

A revisão bibliográfica realizada ao longo do trabalho vislumbra conceitos e formatos sobre redes de empresas, sobre o Programa Redes de Cooperação e sobre diferentes abordagens do processo de mudança organizacional. O estudo de caso foi realizado na Associação Serrana das Indústrias de Usinagem (ASIUSI), uma rede do setor metal-mecânico, integrante do Programa Redes de Cooperação que é desenvolvido pela Secretaria do Desenvolvimento e dos Assuntos Internacionais do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (SEDAI) e operacionalizado pela Universidade de Caxias do Sul (UCS). Os dados foram coletados junto aos representantes das empresas na Associação, através de entrevistas e interpretados por meio da análise de conteúdo. O resultado da análise foi comparado com cinco abordagens de mudanças organizacionais. A comparação evidenciou que a maioria das fases da estrutura de mudanças nas empresas pesquisadas se identifica com as abordagens teóricas as quais foram comparadas, excetuando-se as fases que tratam de aspectos específicos ao formato organizacional ao qual as mesmas estão inseridas.
