For non-flat almost quaternionic manifolds we compute the next biggest (submaximal) symmetry dimension. We show that it is equal to 4 n^ 2 - 4 n+ 9 for n> 1 (it is equal to 8 for n= 1).

40|$|Constitutive {{relations}} concerning hyperelastic {{and plastic}} material behaviour are generalised from small to finite deformations using {{the concept of}} dual variables. Two families of dual strain and stress tensor are considered. Consequently, there exist two possibilities for formulating plastic constitutive models {{with respect to the}} actual configuration. Using these constitutive models, the stress distribution is calculated for the case of simple torsion {{as well as for the}} case of <b>torsion</b> with <b>free</b> ends. It turns out that for hyperelasticity the investigated second-order effects depend decisively on the material parameters, and not on the chosen variables. For plasticity laws, on the other hand, the second-order effects investigated depend decisively on the chosen dual variables, and less on the material parameters. (orig.) 12 refs.

40|$|The present article proposes an {{alternative}} way {{to compute the}} torsional stiffness based on three-dimensional continuum mechanics instead of applying a specific theory of torsion. A thin, representative beam slice is discretized by solid finite elements. Adequate boundary conditions and coupling conditions are integrated into the numerical model to obtain a proper answer on the torsion behaviour, thus on shear center, shear stress and torsional stiffness. This finite element approach only includes general assumptions of beam torsion which are independent of cross-section geometry. These assumptions essentially are: no in-plane deformation, constant <b>torsion</b> and <b>free</b> warping. Thus {{it is possible to}} achieve numerical solutions of high accuracy for arbitrary cross-sections. Due to the direct link to three-dimensional continuum mechanics, it is possible to extend the range of torsion analysis to sections which are composed of different materials or even to heterogeneous beams on a high scale of resolution.
