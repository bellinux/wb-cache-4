25|$|<b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas {{do not agree with}} the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E

Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I think <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of personalities emerging between now and 2012.

500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating {{in an interview that he}} believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Graeme Souness became {{manager and}} {{declared}} his intent {{to build a}} team based on merit {{rather than relying on}} personal restrictions. A year later he signed Rangers' first black player Mark Walters. In 1989, Souness signed Mo Johnston, a former Celtic player and openly Catholic. This was Rangers' first signing of an openly Catholic player since the unwritten policy was introduced, though there had been claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into Old Firm sectarianism. According to Johnston's agent Bill McMurdo, Souness had been eager to sign a Catholic player, and had negotiated in secret with [...] "four or five" [...] before signing Johnston. At a press conference following his signing, the English Rangers players attended however the Scottish players boycotted it. The chairman of the Rangers Supporters Association stated [...] "It's a sad day for Rangers, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people handing back their season tickets. I don't want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. Rangers have always stood for one thing and the majority of the support have been brought {{up with the idea of}} a true blue Rangers team." [...] As he predicted, Rangers fans responded by burning their season tickets; Celtic supporters claimed Johnston had betrayed Catholicism, calling him [...] "Judas". The Rangers kitman refused to lay out Johnston's kit before each match as a protest against a Catholic playing for Rangers.|$|E

[...] The [...] "huge emotional investment" [...] users have made in LittleBigPlanet, Alex Evans stated, is the reason {{he does not want to}} ship a traditional sequel.

[...] Reid also said that Gavin [...] "clearly didn't do a bad job" [...] of raising Ben, Ben does not blame Gavin for being lied to about Kathy and Gavin's fake deaths, and Ben finds Gavin more understanding than his own father. However, he said that Ben knows Gavin has a [...] "nasty edge". Treadwell-Collins promised [...] "an interesting dynamic" [...] between Ben and Gavin, saying that Gavin would [...] "manipulate Ben as well as Kathy".|$|E

Aguilera released a statement about the tour, saying: [...] "Headlining my own tour means creative control and a high-energy, let-loose show. It's designed with my band and dancers to be a visually exciting mix of my big hits and some special surprises," [...] said Christina. [...] "Plus, my sponsors, Sears and Levi's, are giving fans lots of ways {{to get involved with}} the tour, like exclusive CDs and posters, a chance to win a backstage pass to hang with me and a cause-related program called 'Come On Over and Do Something' that was created specifically for the tour." [...] About the tour's setlist, she claimed, [...] "I'll be doing songs from my debut album. But I've changed so much from doing that at 17, so we'll put a whole new twist on things from my album. … <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of blues and soul inflections, which is what I've wanted to do more of for a long time." [...] One feature of the shows she described involved getting the crowd excited with her hit [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] and then switching to a piano-and-vocal-only song by her hero, blues legend Etta James.|$|E
50|$|The {{first five}} {{chapters}} {{deal with the}} terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are {{the basis of the}} well-known Square of opposition. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern quantification theory. The last three chapters deal with modalities. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the sea-battle. (If it <b>is</b> true that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sea-battle tomorrow, then it is true today that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sea-battle. Thus <b>a</b> sea-battle <b>is</b> apparently unavoidable, and thus necessary. Another interpretation would be: that we can not know that which has not yet come to pass. In other words: if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sea battle tomorrow then it is true today that tomorrow <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sea battle.
