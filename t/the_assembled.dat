40|$|Tuning and {{characterizing the}} {{interfacial}} structure of organic semiconductors on graphene {{is essential for}} graphene-based devices. Regulation of <b>the</b> supramolecular <b>assembling</b> structure of oligothiophenes on graphene by changing functional groups attached to the backbone of oligothiophenes is described and <b>the</b> <b>assembling</b> behavior is compared with that on the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} Texians {{were killed}} at the Battle of the Alamo when the Mexican army {{attacked}} on March 6; Travis was likely the first to die.

Earlier that day, General Sam Houston, newly reappointed commander of the Texian Army, had arrived in Gonzales.

Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts.

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target.

This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|The gate {{formed by}} the α {{subunits}} prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering {{the interior of the}} 20S particle. The ATP molecules bound before the initial recognition step are hydrolyzed before translocation. While energy is needed for substrate unfolding, it is not required for translocation. <b>The</b> <b>assembled</b> 26S proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins {{in the presence of a}} non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, but cannot degrade folded proteins, indicating that energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding. Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via facilitated diffusion if the 19S cap is in the ATP-bound state.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death.

Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip in front of <b>the</b> <b>assembled</b> nobles.|$|E
