25|$|Ideally, the {{computational}} method {{will be able}} to predict affinity before a compound is synthesized and hence in theory only one compound needs to be synthesized, saving enormous time and cost. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> present {{computational method}}s are imperfect and provide, at best, only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. In practice it still takes several iterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal drug is discovered. Computational methods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and have often provided novel structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{long history}} of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western {{clothing}} as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not.

However, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E

25|$|A sea kayak's {{primary safety}} device is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{genre that}} was once {{rejected}} by mainstream Christian churches is now considered by some {{as one of the}} most-important recruitment tool of their successor congregations. According to Terri McLean, author of New Harmonies, old-guard churches (United Methodist is given as an example) of the late 1990s were experiencing a rapid decline in membership and were under threat of disbandment within the next decade, a trend that has been going on since the 1980s. McLean, using numerous quotes from theologians, Christian apologists and professors, goes on to offer contemporary Christian music as the reason for the falling popularity of more traditionalist churches. The definition of contemporary Christian, as offered by New Harmonies, is of a genre not far removed from traditional hymns; it is simply more accessible. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while a form of modernized hymns do exist in today's churches and do affect church recruitment, there also exists both within and outside these churches a form of music (Christian rock) that has only one element in common with previous religious genres: its worship of God.|$|E

500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic {{song about}} growing old" [...] {{according}} to singer Gruff Rhys.

The track was recorded in 2000 at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E

[...] "Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft." [...] A year after the Rockets failed to draft Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps; Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured, and he was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. [...] "He's incredibly athletic," [...] said Morey. [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every fucking person, including me, thought he was unathletic.

Alfred Moran, {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> what Madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty." ...|$|E

500|$|Antibiotics {{tend to be}} {{extensively}} {{used for}} emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic culture and sensitivity are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics {{are seen as a}} [...] "quick fix" [...] by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as tooth extraction) which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in antibiotic resistance. They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, dry socket, or mild pericoronitis. However, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> antibiotics are rarely needed, and they should be used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.|$|E
