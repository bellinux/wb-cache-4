50|$|Some critics use {{the example}} of the trolley problem to {{invalidate}} NAP. In case of the runaway <b>trolley,</b> <b>headed</b> for five victims tied to the track, NAP does not allow a trolley passenger to flip the switch that diverts the trolley to a different track if there is a person tied to that track. That person would have been unharmed if nothing was done, therefore by flipping the switch NAP is violated. Another example often cited by critics is human shields.|$|R

30|$|The neuroscientific {{study of}} moral {{judgment}} (reviewed by Greene, 2013, Chapter 4) provides another example, particularly concerning the two trolley problems. In one version, {{the choice is}} whether to switch a runaway <b>trolley</b> <b>heading</b> for five people to another track {{where it would be}} heading for one. In the footbridge version, the choice is whether to push a man off a bridge, thus stopping the trolley, to save the five. Most subjects say “yes” to the first case and “no” to the second. Brain regions responsible for self-control are associated with “yes” responses to the first, and regions associated with emotion are associated with “no” responses to the second. These findings are consistent with a psychological theory in which an initial emotional response may be corrected by a subsequent reflective response, thus controlling the impulse to respond based on emotion.|$|R

50|$|Emotions and an {{understanding}} of social norms are used to provide reasoning of the moral nature on our behaviors, beliefs, and the people around us. The vmPFC works as the neural basis in allowing emotion to influence moral judgement. The trolley dilemma is a classic situation testing emotional involvement in moral judgment. In the trolley dilemma, participants imagine a runaway <b>trolley</b> <b>heading</b> toward five people who will be killed if the trolley is to continue. The participant is to decide whether to allow the trolley to run its course, or to shunt the trolley off to another track where it will only kill one person. Most people choose to throw the switch, concluding that it is moral to save five by sacrificing the life of one. In a variation, there is no switch at hand to shunt the trolley, instead the participant has the option to push someone on the trolley tracks to stop it from moving. Most people are repulsed at the idea of pushing the man to his death, even though outcome {{is the same as the}} first dilemma, with five people surviving and one person dying. The more personal nature of pushing someone onto the tracks discourages this response, and the role of emotion is proposed to be the difference in the reasoning. In functional imaging studies, increased activity in the vmPFC is associated with thinking of these personal moral situations, while making harmless decisions does not. Patients with vmPFC lesions made the same decision in non-moral and moral personal dilemmas. Dysfunction of the vmPFC causes failure in using correct moral emotion, which explains why these patients showed less emotional responses when facing these dilemmas.|$|R

However an earlier version, in which the one person to be sacrificed on the track was the switchman's child, was part of a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin in 1905, and the German legal scholar Hans Welzel discussed a similar problem in 1951.|$|R

5000|$|The Indians players {{knew that}} Lingo's only {{goal was to}} {{advertise}} his Airedales and that winning football games wasn't important to him. Therefore, the players {{spent a lot of}} their free time partying and drinking. In 1922 the night before a game with the Chicago Bears, the Indians went to a Chicago bar called [...] "Everyman's Saloon." [...] At 2:00 a.m., the bartender stopped serving drinks since Illinois law prohibited the sale of alcohol after 2 a.m. This action upset the Indians who stuffed the bartender in a telephone booth and turned it upside down. The Indians lost to the Bears 33-6 just a few hours later. Another instance in November 1923 in St. Louis (as the Indians were in town for a game against the All-Stars) occurred when several of the Indians went out drinking for the night. As the night came to an end, the players {{decided it was time to}} return to their hotel. They soon found a trolley that could take them back to their rooms, however that particular <b>trolley</b> was <b>headed</b> in the opposite direction. To solve this problem, the Indians players reportedly picked up the trolley, and turned it around on the tracks. They then told the conductor the address for their hotel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Television (TV) trolley tip-over incidences {{are common}} {{and can cause}} {{significant}} morbidity and mortality in children. This study was aimed at analyzing the pattern and outcomes of head injuries resulting from TV trolley tip-over. METHOD: We conducted a medical chart review of children with TV <b>trolley</b> tip-over <b>head</b> injuries from January 2009 to April 2016. We collected data on demographics, the mechanism of injury, clinical and radiological features of the injury, and outcomes. Outcomes were measured {{by means of the}} Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months (except in 1 case). A descriptive analysis was carried out using SPSS v 19. RESULT: Twenty-two children were included in the study (median age 23. 5 months). Sixteen children were male. Most of the children (n = 16) were aged 12 - 35 months. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 15. The median Rotterdam Score for the patients was 2. 0. Common symptoms upon admission were vomiting, irritability, scalp laceration, and bruises. Median length of hospital stay was 3 days. Skull bone fractures were present in 12 children. Other CT findings included contusions, extradural and subdural haematomas, intraventricular haemorrhage, and pneumocranium. Surgical intervention was required in 4 cases. Although most of the patients made a good recovery (GOS = 5), 1 patient developed a mild disability and another died in hospital. CONCLUSION: TV trolley tip-over is most common in toddlers and can lead to significant head injury and mortality. This can be avoided by parental supervision and adjustments in the household...|$|R
5000|$|Electrical {{power for}} the tramway was {{supplied}} by a generating station located near the London Road depot, and {{it was decided to}} transport coal from the coal pier on the seafront to the generating station along the tramway. The Corporation owned a small loading pier on the sea front, near to the gas works, and this was rebuilt in 1914, incorporating a spur to enable trams to run onto it. Three 4-wheel coal trams, numbered 1A to 3A, were built by Grenshaw & Piers of Bolton, with cabs at both ends, and two large [...] "V"-skips between them. They were painted grey, and worked from 1915 until the early 1930s, when the steam engines were replaced by diesel generators. The original generating sets produced 200 kilowatts each, and were driven by vertical compound Corliss steam engines. The cylinders were 31 in in diameter with a 14 in stroke, and drove the generators at 110 rpm. All of the tramcars used swivel <b>head</b> <b>trolleys,</b> to pick up the power from the overhead wires. These had the advantage that the wires {{did not need to be}} above the centre line of the track, and presented a less cluttered appearance in the streets, particularly when there was double track.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A two-systems {{model of}} moral {{judgment}} proposed by Joshua Greene holds that deontological moral judgments (those based on simple rules concerning action) are often primary and intuitive, and these intuitive judgments must be overridden by reflection {{in order to}} yield utilitarian (consequence-based) responses. For example, one dilemma asks whether it is right to push a man onto a track {{in order to stop}} a <b>trolley</b> that is <b>heading</b> for five others. Those who favor pushing, the utilitarian response, usually take longer to respond than those who oppose pushing. Greene’s model assumes an asymmetry between the processes leading to different responses. We consider an alternative model based on the assumption of symmetric conflict between two response tendencies. By this model, moral dilemmas differ in the “difficulty” of giving a utilitarian response and subjects differ in the “ability ” (tendency) to give such responses. (We could just as easily define ability in terms of deontological responses, as the model treats the responses symmetrically.) We thus make an analogy between moral dilemmas and tests of cognitive ability, and we apply the Rasch model, developed for the latter, to estimate the ability-difficulty difference for each dilemma for each subject. We apply this approach to five data sets collected for other purposes by three of the co-authors. Response time (RT), including yes and no responses, i...|$|R
