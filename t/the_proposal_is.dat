5|$|In July 2010, Conroy delayed {{implementing}} the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> {{not expected to}} go forward due to the opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the kelvin will undergo a fundamental change if <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> accepted. Rather than using the triple point of water to fix the temperature scale the proposal recommends that the energy equivalent as given by Boltzmann's equation be used.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Proposal</b> <b>is</b> a 2009 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds with Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson. The plot {{centers on a}} Canadian executive who learns that she may face deportation from the U.S. because of her expired visa. Determined to retain her position as {{editor in chief of}} a publishing house, she convinces her assistant to temporarily act as her fianc√©.|$|E
50|$|Republic P-44 Rocket (1941) {{single-engine}} single-seat propeller fighter aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> for a P-43-based fighter {{with larger}} engine. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected (no prototype built) {{in favor of}} the P-47 Thunderbolt.|$|R
25|$|The Workers' Party {{called for}} a No vote against the Treaty of Lisbon in both the June 2008 referendum, in which <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> defeated, and <b>the</b> October 2009 referendum, in which <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> approved.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1887, no {{alternative}} site had become available and <b>the</b> original <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> renewed. There were slight amendments made to <b>the</b> <b>proposals,</b> but again <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>were</b> rejected.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This {{is suggested by the}} observation that archaea are resistant {{to a wide variety of}} antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The {{first and most}} common is nomination and approval through {{the chain of command}} of the service member. The second method is nomination {{by a member of the}} U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> outside the time limits for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress. Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipients--or in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kin--have been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief. Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then despite the fact that <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it {{is always going to be}} difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, a {{proposal}} {{was made by}} David Wassell, a prominent resident and leader in Allegheny County, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars and improve student services. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that South Allegheny School District join with Elizabeth Forward School District.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} whether to legalize jitneys has been {{considered}} several times by Pennsylvania's Public Utilitiy Commission since at least 1975. The thinking behind <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> that jitneys often service areas regular Yellow Cab drivers will not go, thus picking up slack in transportation needs. Famed Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson wrote a play called Jitney, {{which was published in}} 1982.|$|E

25|$|On 4 May 2016, the European Commission {{proposed}} visa-free {{travel for}} the citizens of Kosovo. The European Commission has proposed to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to lift the visa requirements {{for the people of}} Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa-free list for short-stays in the Schengen area. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> presented together with the Commission's positive assessment confirming that Kosovo has fulfilled the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} of Croydon, <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> for the new route to diverge from the central Croydon loop and use a highway alignment, {{probably}} South End and Brighton Road, to Purley. Beyond Purley, an extension to Coulsdon will be investigated. As this would {{be close to the}} M23 motorway, a possibility would be the construction of a park and ride site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the A23 trunk road.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of Croydon, it is {{proposed}} to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of Thornton Heath Pond, {{the use of a}} shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for trambaan type segregation to Norbury and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> to terminate the line at Streatham railway station, providing an interchange to the extended East London Line.|$|E

50|$|While this <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> {{approved}} by Pershing, it met some resistance when {{it reached the}} Secretary of War. With an initial price tag of almost $800,000 just to open <b>the</b> field, <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> rejected by <b>the</b> Secretary of War on 19 May 1917. That same day <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> resubmitted with <b>the</b> additional argument that a facility such as the 3d AIC was critical {{to the development of}} the air forces that would accompany the A.E.F. to Europe. This time <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>was</b> accepted and by July 1917 the first Aero Construction Squadrons began to arrive in France.|$|R
25|$|In 2015, an {{alliance}} was formed between over 30 Romanian NGOs {{under the name}} of Coalition for Family. The coalition's main activity consisted in promoting and collecting signatures for a citizen's initiative aiming to revise the Constitution and prevent interpretations that would permit gay marriage. By May 2016 the coalition had gathered over 3 million signatures. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> actively supported by the Romanian Orthodox Church. On 20 July 2016, the nine judges of the Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that the proposal to change the constitution's definition of marriage was valid.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, in {{response}} to massive patronage increases on Melbourne's public transport system and increased road infrastructure problems, the State Labor Government released a transport plan which failed {{to deal with the}} construction of the Doncaster line. The proposal investigated the construction of a freeway through Greensborough, into Heidelberg and through the Yarra Flats to connect with the Eastern Freeway at a cost of $6 billion. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> six times the cost of the Doncaster rail line and relies on the continued use of private automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Mishra's {{studies on}} Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} are {{considered by many}} as his most notable contribution. Leishmaniasis, the second largest parasitic killer after Malaria and known locally as Kala Azar, was a common disease in the area and, after extensive research funded by the World Health Organization, Dr. Mishra proposed the use of Amphotericin B (Fungizone) to combat the disease through an article he published in Lancet in 1991. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a pioneering one and the drug is the one most commonly used the world over to treat Kala Azar.|$|E

25|$|What is {{commonly}} known as an appeal is more correctly known as a proposal to alter the rating list. Proposals can be made on a number of grounds, including challenging the basic rateable value, an alteration to the property, or proposing a reduction from a specific date due to a particular event (such as changes to a street affecting traffic). When an appeal is made, it will first be discussed with the Valuation Office Agency, who will attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached, and <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> not withdrawn, it will be heard by an independent valuation tribunal.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister is {{appointed}} indirectly by the Parliament.

The Prime Minister appoints the ministers. Neither the Prime Minister nor a minister may hold their seats if a vote no confidence is put forward and 17 MPs are opposed. The Prime Minister has at any time the power to call an election. The Prime Minister and the ministers are not permitted to hold seats in the Parliament.|$|E
25|$|T-55 Fire Support - Uralvagonzavod is {{offering}} the Peruvian Army an upgrade for its T-55s {{as an alternative}} to replacement with new tanks. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> to replace the turret of their current tanks with the turret of the BMPT. The BMPT turret is equipped with two 2A42 30 mm autocannons, two AGS-17 grenade launchers, four 9M120 Ataka-V ATGMs, and a PKTM machine gun. Every operator in the turret has a scope, and the main armament operator has a thermal camera, an optical sight, and a panoramic camera. It is also equipped with a laser detection system. Although the BMPT design fits onto a T-72 tank chassis, it can be adapted to fit on a T-55.|$|E
