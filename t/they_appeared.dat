5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once suggested that <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> before the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E
5000|$|Both {{may be true}}. The thesis may be true {{of things}}-in-themselves (other than as <b>they</b> <b>appear).</b> The antithesis may be true of things as <b>they</b> <b>appear.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in the MAR's view, {{as well as}} offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E
5|$|Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with Know-Nothing members. After {{the men had}} recovered, <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> {{before a grand jury}} to respond to any charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. Hindman {{received}} praise for his actions and became a force in Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Cruz had {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with Tom Cruise after <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> together in Vanilla Sky. It ended in January 2004. In April 2003, she {{filed a lawsuit}} against the Australian magazine New Idea for defamation over an article about her relationship with Cruise.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> {{commonly}} <b>appear</b> in watery {{areas like}} wetlands, {{and also in}} forests, prairies, and graveyards, and <b>they</b> often <b>appear</b> in places surrounded by natural features, but rarely <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> in towns as well.|$|R

The American release was promoted with the group's first tour of the United States, playing fifteen dates in support of Welsh indie rock band The Joy Formidable.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} a second {{object in the}} same region, Pallas. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> indistinguishable from stars.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and {{found it to be}} a multitude of stars packed so densely that <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He {{observed the}} double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.|$|E
5000|$|Most MS lesions are isointense {{to white}} matter (<b>they</b> <b>appear</b> bright) on T1-weighted MRI, {{but some are}} [...] "hypointense" [...] (lower intensity). These are called [...] "black holes" [...] (BH). <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> {{specially}} in the supratentorial region of the brain.|$|R

5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). <b>They</b> <b>appeared</b> to have been shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times {{in the back of}} the head, four times with the gun held within one foot of his head, and once from over two feet away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.|$|E

The CD and DVD Windows editions contain four sub episodes, the fan disc Caramel Box Yarukibako contains four sub episodes {{and a special}} episode, Caramel Box Yarukibako 2 contains two sub episodes, and the PS2 version contains six sub episodes, though {{the order in which}} <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> was altered.|$|E
5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear {{patterns on the}} faces of the mountains in the area. Although <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A dark band on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>appear</b> in Dracula, the musical.|$|R
50|$|When viewed microscopically in cross-section, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> as {{concentric}} rings. In {{a longitudinal}} section, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> {{as a series}} of dark bands. The presence of the dark lines is similar to the annual rings on a tree. They are named after Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius.|$|R

5|$|You made me very low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> like crimes. Yours sincerely, Mary.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered {{a long period of}} decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice. They did not appear in the Finals in this time and only won one of the three series <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in, beating the Atlanta Flames two games to none in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 1991 FA Charity Shield, by virtue of winning the 1990–91 Football League First Division, having lost one match– away to Chelsea– in the entire campaign. This was the club's eleventh Charity Shield appearance; Arsenal won seven previous shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948, 1953) and lost four (1935, 1936, 1979, 1989) previously. Tottenham Hotspur qualified as holders of the FA Cup, beating Nottingham Forest 2–1 in the 1991 FA Cup Final. <b>They</b> <b>appeared</b> in five previous shields, winning four outright (1921, 1951, 1961, 1962), sharing two (1967, 1981) and losing two (1920, 1982).|$|E

50|$|These {{models are}} not part of the {{mainstream}} Metal Gear series continuity, either because <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> in a non-canonical game (Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and Metal Gear Acid) or because the game in which <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> is not a Metal Gear game at all (Snatcher).|$|R

5|$|At {{the four}} corners of the wall sit towers (E) with {{intricate}} roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events wherever <b>they</b> <b>appeared,</b> and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|Benfica {{won their}} first European title in 1961, {{defeating}} Barcelona {{to win the}} European Cup, and successfully retained the title {{in the following year}} after defeating Real Madrid. Since then, <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in five more finals – 1963, '65, '68, '88 and '90 – but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have been attributed to a famous curse by Hungarian manager Béla Guttmann in 1962. Benfica have also played in three UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League finals – 1983, 2013 and '14 – losing all three.|$|E
