The Johns Hopkins University also offers both Ph.D. and Sc.D. in certain programs, with only minor differences in university administration of the degrees. In some institutions, the Sc.D. has been converted to the Ph.D. For instance, the doctoral degree in biostatistics at Harvard recently converted from Sc.D. to Ph.D., even though the doctoral degree structure and requirements have remained identical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} investigates student {{acceptance of}} <b>teaching</b> <b>assistance</b> simulation {{for a computer}} graphics (CG) course. The study proposes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) {{to assess the impact}} of perceived variables and extended variable on intention usage. The perceived variables consist of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and the extended variable consists of interface design. The proposed methodology was then employed in a study using students enrolled in the CG course. A <b>teaching</b> <b>assistance</b> simulator for the CG course was developed using Microsoft Visual C++ and OpenGL. The simulator helps students understand the fundamentals of computer graphics such as the setting of material and lighting of objects, learning the viewport and understanding 3 D transformations. In addition, we also used the tools to teach OpenGL commands in the CG course. The results from the study support the hypotheses. The outcomes indicate that both the perceived and extended variables can effectively predict whether users will adopt a simulation program. Moreover, this research also provides insight into various simulation tools that may be a useful reference for students...|$|E
