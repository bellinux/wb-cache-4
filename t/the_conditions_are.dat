5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a limited amount of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> often met by walking or riding.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> appropriate.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{common for}} older adults; over 75% of those {{over the age}} of 65 develop it. Although less common among people in their 40s or 50s, <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not rare for those individuals. Some {{research}} has found that <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> more common among women.|$|R
40|$|There {{are still}} many things to be found out about {{interstitial}} cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) because the pathological processes underlying <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>are</b> not yet elucidated, biological markers of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>are</b> not yet available, and the type and severity of symptoms can vary, so, clearly defining <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not yet possible...|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{a common}} form of {{treatment}} for <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> a type of hand cream which moisturises the hard skin. However, currently <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> incurable.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} types of supernovae, TypeIa supernovae {{generally}} occur in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals. They show no preference for regions of current stellar formation. As white dwarf stars form {{at the end of}} a star's main sequence evolutionary period, such a long-lived star system may have wandered far from the region where it originally formed. Thereafter a close binary system may spend another million years in the mass transfer stage (possibly forming persistent nova outbursts) before <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> ripe for a TypeIa supernova to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Kronan lie {{at a depth}} of 26m (85ft), 6km (3.7mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions {{to the site of the}} wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> good for {{underwater}} archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand that reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and Kronan has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of emboli {{are from}} {{proximal}} leg deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. DVTs {{are at risk}} for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. <b>The</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> generally regarded as a continuum termed venous thromboembolism (VTE).|$|E

5000|$|According to MeSH, {{the term}} [...] "arthralgia" [...] should only <b>be</b> used when <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> non-inflammatory, and <b>the</b> term [...] "arthritis" [...] should <b>be</b> used when <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> inflammatory.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} by Dr. Alfred H. Freiberg in 1914. He initially thought <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> caused by acute physical trauma, {{which is why}} it was initially called an infraction.|$|R
25|$|In summary, what radical {{interpretation}} highlights is what {{is necessary}} and sufficient for communication to occur. <b>The</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> to recognize speakers as speakers, their beliefs must be mostly coherent and correct; indeterminacy of meaning does not undermine communication, {{but it must be}} constrained just enough.|$|E
25|$|All five {{conditions}} must be met. If {{one or more}} of <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> not met {{the person}} is ineligible for nationality by this particular means under the recent changes to the option procedure affecting the latent Dutch. Residency in the Netherlands is not an eligibility requirement for latent Dutch applicants.|$|E
25|$|The target atmospheres will {{probably}} lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include anaerobic microorganisms. Colonizing anaerobic cyanobacteria may later establish atmospheric oxygen {{that is needed}} for higher evolution, as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the planets later when <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> soon agreed on; we disbanded nine full brigades of horse, and all <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> {{observed}} with <b>the</b> most honour and care {{by the enemy}} that ever I saw in my life.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> rare. <b>The</b> typical {{age range}} of those {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> about 23-66 years of age. It usually occurs in smokers. The male to female ratio {{has been reported}} as 1.95:1, and 2.31:1.|$|R
25|$|The compare {{instructions}} compare two registers or {{a register}} and a literal and write '1' to the destination register if the specified condition is true or '0' if not. <b>The</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> equality, inequality, {{less than or}} equal to, and less than. With the exception of the instructions that specify the former two conditions, there are versions that perform signed and unsigned compares.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> {{particularly}} harsh (e.g.: NaOMe/MeOH/reflux), condensation may occur, {{but this}} {{can usually be}} avoided with mild reagents and low temperatures (e.g., LDA (a strong base), THF, −78°C). Although the aldol addition usually proceeds to near completion under irreversible conditions, the isolated aldol adducts are sensitive to base-induced retro-aldol cleavage to return starting materials. In contrast, retro-aldol condensations are rare, but possible.|$|E
25|$|IMF {{conditionality}} {{is a set}} {{of policies}} or conditions that the IMF requires in exchange for financial resources. The IMF does require collateral from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. If <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> not met, the funds are withheld. The concept of conditionality was introduced in a 1952 Executive Board decision and later incorporated into the Articles of Agreement.|$|E

50|$|In {{humans as}} well, <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> seen rarely.

25|$|Jellyfish Lake is {{connected}} to the ocean through fissures and tunnels in the limestone of an ancient Miocene reef. However the lake is sufficiently isolated and <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> different enough that the diversity of species in the lake is greatly reduced from the nearby lagoon. The golden jellyfish, Mastigias cf. papua etpisoni, and possibly other species in the lake have evolved to be substantially different from their close relatives living in the nearby lagoons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close {{distance}} it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, like the last picture, equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{techniques}} were developed during World War II or earlier, and {{have been used to}} some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book, attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He concludes that {{there is little evidence that}} any of them were dramatically successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over loudspeakers when victory was imminent. It should be noted, though, that measuring the success or failure of psychological warfare is very hard, as <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> very far from being a controlled experiment.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{associations}} of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>are</b> being investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{feeding of}} glucoascorbic acid, an analog of ascorbic acid, to mice and cotton rats caused the {{production}} of a condition exhibiting many of the changes characteristic of scurvy as seen in susceptible species. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> not prevented or cured by ascorbic acid, but was cured by removal of the glucoascorbic acid from <b>the</b> ration. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> produced in mice fed a highly purified ration. It was not produced in mice fed a natural ration. The presence of a substance in certain plant products which prevented {{the production of}} <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{named for}} German physician Georg Sack, who described {{a single case}} in 1936, and British surgeon A.P. Barabas, who described two cases in 1967. Barabas recognized that <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of inherited disorders affecting connective tissue. This <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> now called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type EDS type IV.|$|R
25|$|Referring to potentiality, {{this is what}} a {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> right and it is not {{prevented}} by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
25|$|The Somali Region and the Danakil Depression in the Afar Region have a hot, {{sunny and}} dry climate {{producing}} fully desert or semi-desert conditions. The terrain {{in the lower}} basin of the Sobat is hot, swampy and malarious. However, over {{the greater part of}} Ethiopia as well as the Oromia highlands the climate is very healthy and temperate. The country lies wholly within the tropics, but its nearness to the equator is counterbalanced by the elevation of the land. In the deep valleys of the Tekezé and Abay, and generally in places below , <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> tropical and diseases such as malaria are prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Preceded by {{induced changes}} in eggshell permeability, {{hatching}} may involve physical and/or enzymatic processes in plant-parasitic nematodes. Cyst nematodes, such as Globodera rostochiensis, {{may require a}} specific signal from the root exudates of the host to trigger hatching. Root-knot nematodes are generally unaffected {{by the presence of}} a host, but hatch freely at the appropriate temperature when water is available. However, in an egg mass or cyst, not all eggs will hatch when <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> optimal for their particular species, leaving some eggs to hatch at a later date. Ammonium ions have been shown to inhibit hatching and to reduce the plant-penetration ability of M. incognita juveniles that do hatch.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} as a function applied {{to a set of}} dependent <b>conditions,</b> to allow <b>the</b> structure of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> to <b>be</b> controlled. Also <b>the</b> set of <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> used in narrowing by exclusion of dependent values. However for most purposes the value set may {{be thought of as a}} set of value, <b>condition</b> pairs. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> function translates <b>the</b> set into <b>the</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R
