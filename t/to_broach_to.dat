60|$|The {{subject was}} not an easy one <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to</b> his {{somewhat}} forbidding friend, as he discovered when the latter arrived about half an hour later. Derek had been attending the semi-annual banquet of the Worshipful Dry-Salters Company down in the City, understudying one of the speakers, a leading member of Parliament, who had been unable to appear; and he was still in the grip of that feeling of degraded repletion which City dinners induce.|$|E
60|$|The {{crew were}} worn out with fatigue and want of sleep, for running {{as they were}} in this unknown sea, none could say what might happen, or when land might be sighted ahead. The captain never left the poop--he and the mates taking their places, by turn, with the men at the helm; for the {{slightest}} error in steering might have caused the vessel <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to,</b> in which case nothing could have saved her. Sheltered as was the caboose, it was found impossible to keep a fire alight, and officers and men, alike, had to content themselves with biscuit and draughts of ale.|$|E
60|$|The Francis Spaight {{was running}} before it solely under a mizzentopsail, when the thing happened. It was {{not due to}} {{carelessness}} so much as {{to the lack of}} discipline of the crew and {{to the fact that they}} were indifferent seamen at best. The man at the wheel in particular, a Limerick man, had had no experience with salt water beyond that of rafting timber on the Shannon between the Quebec vessels and the shore. He was afraid of the huge seas that rose out of the murk astern and bore down upon him, and he was more given to cowering away from their threatened impact than he was to meeting their blows with the wheel and checking the ship's rush <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{man nodded}} {{and made his}} way forward; he endeavoured to carry out the first part of his orders, but the moment he raised the floor-board above the level of the gunwale it was {{wrenched}} from his hands and blown ahead. With the aid of two other men he managed to step the mast. The mate waved his hand to him to say that that would do for the present. The man, however, prepared the sail ready for hoisting, rolling it up tightly and winding a cord round and round it; then he hooked the head on to the traveller on the mast, and lay down at its foot, holding the halliard in readiness to hoist it. The water was still perfectly smooth, and the boat flew straight before the wind without any tendency <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to.</b> Stephen, after the stroke-oar had gone forward, crept aft until he was beside the mate, and there lay for a time, feeling half-stupefied by the tremendous roar of the cyclone.|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} wheel. The sailing-master watched {{me for a}} space. He was afraid of my youth, feared that I lacked the {{strength}} and the nerve. But {{when he saw me}} successfully wrestle the schooner through several bouts, he went below to breakfast. Fore and aft, all hands were below at breakfast. Had she broached to, not one of them would ever have reached the deck. For forty minutes I stood there alone at the wheel, in my grasp the wildly careering schooner and the lives of twenty-two men. Once we were pooped. I saw it coming, and, half-drowned, with tons of water crushing me, I checked the schooner's rush <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to.</b> At the end of the hour, sweating and played out, I was relieved. But I had done it! With my own hands I had done my trick at the wheel and guided a hundred tons of wood and iron through a few million tons of wind and waves.|$|E
60|$|Possibly the proudest {{achievement}} of my life, my moment of highest living, occurred when I was seventeen. I {{was in a}} three-masted schooner {{off the coast of}} Japan. We were in a typhoon. All hands had been on deck most of the night. I was called from my bunk at seven in the morning to take the wheel. Not a stitch of canvas was set. We were running before it under bare poles, yet the schooner fairly tore along. The seas were all of an eighth of a mile apart, and the wind snatched the whitecaps from their summits, filling. The air so thick with driving spray {{that it was impossible to}} see more than two waves at a time. The schooner was almost unmanageable, rolling her rail under to starboard and to port, veering and yawing anywhere between south-east and south-west, and threatening, when the huge seas lifted under her quarter, <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to.</b> Had she broached to, she would ultimately have been reported lost with all hands and no tidings.|$|E

30|$|TBP {{insertion}} {{starts with}} the same conventional steps by inserting the guidewires into the epiphysis and metaphysis, straddling the physis. After fluoroscopic confirmation {{of the position of}} the guidewires, the cannulated drill bit is used <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> the cortex <b>to</b> a depth of 5  mm in the bone. A standard 4.5 -mm cannulated screw from the TBP set is used to tap the screw tract over the guidewires for approximately three-quarters of the planned screw length. After removing the guidewires, the solid screws are then inserted in each hole to follow the tapped tracts.|$|R
60|$|I saw I hadn't got {{the hang}} of the steering, and so couldn't rightly tell where I {{was going to bring}} up when I started. I went afoot the rest of the day, and let my wings hang. Early next morning I went to a private place to have some practice. I got up on a pretty high rock, and got a good start, and went {{swooping}} down, aiming for a bush a little over three hundred yards off; but I couldn't seem to calculate for the wind, which was about two points abaft my beam. I could see I was going considerable to looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead strong on the port one, but it wouldn't answer; I could see I was going <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to,</b> so I slowed down on both, and lit. I went back to the rock and took another chance at it. I aimed two or three points to starboard of the bush--yes, more than that--enough so as to make it nearly a head-wind. I done well enough, but made pretty poor time. I could see, plain enough, that on a head-wind, wings was a mistake. I could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he couldn't go in the wind's eye. I could see that if I wanted to go a-visiting any distance from home, and the wind was ahead, I might have to wait days, maybe, for a change; and I could see, too, that these things could not be any use at all in a gale; if you tried to run before the wind, you would make a mess of it, for there isn't anyway to shorten sail--like reefing, you know--you have to take it ALL in--shut your feathers down flat to your sides. That would LAND you, of course. You could lay to, with your head to the wind--that is the best you could do, and right hard work you'd find it, too. If you tried any other game, you would founder, sure.|$|E
60|$|From La Crosse to St. Paul the {{distance}} {{up the river}} is something over 200 miles; and from St. Paul down to Dubuque in Iowa, to which we went on our return, {{the distance}} is 450 miles. We were, therefore, for a considerable time on board these boats--more so than such a journey may generally make necessary, as we were delayed at first by the soldiers, and afterward by accidents, such as the breaking of a paddle-wheel, and other causes, to which navigation on the Upper Mississippi seems to be liable. On the whole, we slept on board four nights, and lived on board as many days. I cannot say that the life was comfortable, though I {{do not know that}} it could be made more so by any care {{on the part of the}} boat owners. My first complaint would be against the great heat of the cabins. The Americans, as a rule, live in an atmosphere which is almost unbearable by an Englishman. To this cause, I am convinced, is to be attributed their thin faces, their pale skins, their unenergetic temperament--unenergetic as regards physical motion--and their early old age. The winters are long and cold in America, and mechanical ingenuity is far extended. These two facts together have created a system of stoves, hot-air pipes, steam chambers, and heating apparatus so extensive that, from autumn till the end of spring, all inhabited rooms are filled with the atmosphere of a hot oven. An Englishman fancies that he is to be baked, and for awhile finds it almost impossible to exist in the air prepared for him. How the heat is engendered on board the river steamers I do not know, but it is engendered to so great a degree that the sitting-cabins are unendurable. The patient is therefore driven out at all hours into the outside balconies of the boat, or on to the top roof--for it is a roof rather than a deck-- and there, as he passes through the air at the rate of twenty miles an hour, finds himself chilled to the very bones. That is my first complaint. But as the boats are made for Americans, and as Americans like hot air, I do not put it forward with any idea that a change ought to be effected. My second complaint is equally unreasonable, and is quite as incapable of a remedy as the first. Nine-tenths of the travelers carry children with them. They are not tourists engaged on pleasure excursions, but men and women intent on the business of life. They are moving up and down looking for fortune and in search of new homes. Of course they carry with them all their household goods. Do not let any critic say that I grudge these young travelers their right to locomotion. Neither their right to locomotion is grudged by me, nor any of those privileges which are accorded in America to the rising generation. The habits of their country and the choice of their parents give to them full dominion over all hours and over all places, and it would ill become a foreigner to make such habits and such choice a ground of serious complaint. But, nevertheless, the uncontrolled energies of twenty children round one's legs do not convey comfort or happiness, when the passing events are producing noise and storm rather than peace and sunshine. I must protest that American babies are an unhappy race. They eat and drink just as they please; they are never punished; they are never banished, snubbed, and kept in the background as children are kept with us, and yet they are wretched and uncomfortable. My heart has bled for them as I have heard them squalling by the hour together in agonies of discontent and dyspepsia. Can it be, I wonder, that children are happier when they are made to obey orders, and are sent to bed at six o'clock, than when allowed to regulate their own conduct; that bread and milk are more favorable to laughter and soft, childish ways than beef-steaks and pickles three times a day; that an occasional whipping, even, will conduce to rosy cheeks? It is an idea which I should never dare <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to</b> an American mother; but I must confess that, after my travels on the Western Continent, my opinions have a tendency in that direction. Beef-steaks and pickles certainly produce smart little men and women. Let that be taken for granted. But rosy laughter and winning, childish ways are, I fancy, the produce of bread and milk. But there was a third reason why traveling on these boats was not so pleasant as I had expected. I could not get my fellow-travelers to talk to me. It must be understood that our fellow-travelers were not generally of that class which we Englishmen, in our pride, designate as gentlemen and ladies. They were people, as I have said, in search of new homes and new fortunes. But I protest that as such they would have been, in those parts, much more agreeable as companions to me than any gentlemen or any ladies, if only they would have talked to me. I do not accuse them of any incivility. If addressed, they answered me. If application was made by me for any special information, trouble was taken to give it me. But I found no aptitude, no wish for conversation--nay, even a disinclination to converse. In the Western States I do not think that I was ever addressed first by an American sitting next to me at table. Indeed, I never held any conversation at a public table in the West. I have sat in the same room with men for hours, and have not had a word spoken to me. I have done my very best to break through this ice, and have always failed. A Western American man is not a talking man. He will sit for hours over a stove, with a cigar in his mouth and his hat over his eyes, chewing the cud of reflection. A dozen will sit together in the same way, and there shall not be a dozen words spoken between them in an hour. With the women one's chance of conversation is still worse. It seemed as though the cares of the world had been too much for them, and that all talking excepting as to business--demands, for instance, on the servants for pickles for their children--had gone by the board. They were generally hard, dry, and melancholy. I am speaking, of course, of aged females--from five and twenty, perhaps, to thirty--who had long since given up the amusements and levities of life. I very soon abandoned any attempt at drawing a word from these ancient mothers of families; but not the less did I ponder in my mind over the circumstances of their lives. Had things gone with them so sadly--was the struggle for independence so hard--that all the softness of existence had been trodden out of them? In the cities, too, it was much the same. It seemed to me that a future mother of a family, in those parts, had left all laughter behind her when she put out her finger for the wedding ring.|$|E
50|$|A pulling cutter was a boat {{carried by}} sailing ships {{for work in}} fairly {{sheltered}} water in which load-carrying capacity was needed, for example in laying a kedge. This operation was the placing of a relatively light anchor {{at a distance from}} the ship so as to be able to haul her off in its direction. The oars were double-banked. That is, there were two oarsmen on each thwart. In a seaway, the longboat was preferred to the cutter as the finer lines of the stern of the former meant that it was less likely <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> <b>to</b> in a following sea. In the Royal Navy the cutters were replaced by 25 and 32 ft motor cutters. However, the cutters' traditional work had grown beyond the capacity of a boat as ships became larger. Though primarily a pulling boat, this cutter could also be rigged for sailing.|$|E

30|$|TBPs use {{cannulated}} screws {{which provide}} ease {{and accuracy of}} screw insertion over a guidewire [3, 5, 8]. After first passing a 1.5 -mm guidewire, a 3.2 -mm cannulated drill is used <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> the cortex <b>to</b> a depth of 5  mm followed by insertion of cannulated 4.5 -mm screws. Such accuracy is very important especially in young children to avoid injuring the physis and to avoid penetrating into the joint. Several reports have described broken screws in TBP constructs, particularly in obese patients [5, 10, 11]. In response to this problem, the manufacturers are now offering solid, non-cannulated screws for added strength and resistance to fracture.|$|R

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a <b>broach,</b> <b>to</b> remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary.

Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened <b>to</b> <b>broach.</b> In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|R
