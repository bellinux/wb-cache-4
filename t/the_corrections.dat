5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes <b>the</b> <b>corrections</b> and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). <b>The</b> <b>corrections</b> resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies {{were said to be}} anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E

40|$|In CT colonography (CTC), orally {{administered}} positive-contrast tagging {{agents are}} often used for differentiating residual bowel contents from native colonic structures. However, tagged materials can sometimes hyperattenuate observed CT numbers of their adjacent untagged materials. Such pseudoenhancement complicates the differentiation of colonic soft-tissue structures from tagged materials, because pseudoenhanced colonic structures may have CT numbers {{that are similar to}} those of tagged materials. The authors developed a nonlinear regression-based (NLRB) method for performing a local image-based pseudoenhancement correction of CTC data. To calibrate <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> parameters, <b>the</b> CT data of an anthropomorphic reference phantom were correlated with those of partially tagged phantoms. The CTC data were registered spatially by use of an adaptive multiresolution method, and untagged and tagged partial-volume soft-tissue surfaces were correlated by use of a virtual tagging scheme. The NLRB method was then optimized to minimize the difference in the CT numbers of soft-tissue regions between the untagged and tagged phantom CTC data by use of the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method. To validate the method, the CT numbers of untagged regions were compared with those of registered pseudoenhanced phantom regions before and after <b>the</b> <b>correction.</b> <b>The</b> CT numbers were significantly different before performing <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> (p< 0. 01), whereas, after <b>the</b> <b>correction,</b> <b>the</b> difference between the CT numbers was not significant. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> was also tested on the size measurement of polyps that were covered by tagging in phantoms and in clinical cases. In phantom cases, before <b>the</b> <b>correction,</b> <b>the</b> diameters of 12 simulated polyps submerged in tagged fluids that were measured in a soft-tissue CT display were significantly different from those measured in an untagged phantom (p< 0. 01), whereas after <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> <b>the</b> difference was not significant. In clinical cases, before <b>the</b> <b>correction,</b> <b>the</b> diameters of 29 colonoscopy-confirmed 3 – 14 mm polyps affected by tagging that were measured in a soft-tissue CT display were significantly different from those measured in a lung CT display (p< 0. 0001) or in colonoscopy (p< 0. 05), whereas after <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> <b>the</b> difference was not significant. Finally, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> was tested on automated detection of 25 polyps ≥ 6 mm affected by tagging in 56 clinical CTC cases. The application of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> increased <b>the</b> detection accuracy from 60 % with 5. 0 FP detections per patient without correction to 96 % with 2. 9 FP detections with correction. This improvement in detection accuracy was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The results indicate that the proposed NLRB method can yield an accurate pseudoenhancement correction with potentially significant benefits in clinical CTC examinations...|$|R
40|$|Small {{refractive}} errors {{present a}} group of specific far-sighted refractive dispositions that are compensated by enhanced accommodative exertion and aren’t exhibited by loss of the visual acuity 1. This paper should answer a few questions about their correction, flowing from theoretical presumptions and expectations of this dilemma. The main goal {{of this research was}} to (dis) confirm the hypothesis about convenience, efficiency and frequency of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> that do not raise the visual acuity (or if the improvement isn’t noticeable). The next goal was to examine the connection between this correction and other factors (age, size of the refractive error, etc.). The last aim was to describe the subjective personal rating of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> of these small refractive errors, and to determine the minimal improvement of the visual acuity, that is attractive enough for the client to purchase <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> (glasses, contact lenses). It was confirmed, that there’s an indispensable group of subjects with good visual acuity, where <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> is applicable, although it doesn’t improve the visual acuity much. The main importance is to eliminate the asthenopia. The prime reason for acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> is typically changing during the life, so as the accommodation is declining. Young people prefer <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> on <b>the</b> ground of the asthenopia, caused by small refractive error or latent strabismus; elderly people acquire <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> because of improvement of the visual acuity.
