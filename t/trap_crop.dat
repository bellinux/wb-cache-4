5|$|A <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> is {{a crop of}} a {{plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a <b>trap</b> <b>crop,</b> luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

40|$|Four <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to {{intercept}} stinkbugs (Heteroptera pentatomidae) in a cucurbit field crop at Waterpoort, Limpopo Province. The experimental <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were: Sunnhemp (Crotolaria juncea), okra (Abelmoschus esculentum), mustard mixture (Brassica hirta and Brassica juncea) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). The surveys were based on visual counts of stinkbugs from all the <b>trap</b> <b>crops.</b> Stinkbugs were collected from <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> in a field crop trial of cantaloupe (Cucumis melo). The correlation between Brassica hirta and Brassica juncea with other <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> had a great variance. The repeated B. hirta and B. juncea inner row experiment in 2012 interestingly lured the green stinkbug (Nezara viridula) into the cantaloupe field. Amongst the entire <b>trap</b> <b>crops,</b> stinkbugs recovered from Brassica hirta and Bassica juncea, exceeded the average of the other three <b>trap</b> <b>crops.</b> The number of adult N. viridula captured had significantly increased in March 2012 and started to drop on the B. hirta and B. juncea mixture {{in the first week of}} April. During this increase, the crops were at the seeding stage. The perimeter trap-cropping system practiced for all four <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> varied in the attraction of stinkbugs along the perimeter of the field and inner row. B. hirta and B. juncea attracted a high number of N. viridula along the perimeter but fewer in the inner row. The B. hirta and B. juncea recorded the highest number of N. viridula in the inner rows and outer rows, compared to the other four <b>trap</b> <b>crops,</b> followed by V. ungiuculata.

40|$|<b>Trap</b> <b>crops</b> were {{employed}} against the pink bollworm (PBW) {{as a part}} of a community-wide IPM program in Pima County, AZ. Levels of PBW larvae in the early squares of the <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were extraordinarily high, indicating that the <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were drawing overwintered PBW moths in from wide areas. This concentrated the overwintered moths in small areas where they could be easily and economically destroyed...|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{pests and}} {{diseases}} that afflict other solanaceous plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to eggplants. For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since eggplants {{can be particularly}} susceptible to pests such as whiteflies, they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as pepper, as a sacrificial <b>trap</b> <b>crop.</b> Four years should separate successive crops of eggplants to reduce pest pressure.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{practices}} include polyculture (growing multiple {{types of}} plants), crop rotation, planting crops {{in areas where}} the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop. Trap crops have successfully controlled pests in some commercial agricultural systems while reducing pesticide usage; however, in many other systems, trap crops can fail to reduce pest densities at a commercial scale, even when the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> works in controlled experiments. In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.|$|E
5000|$|Trap crops can {{be planted}} around the {{circumference}} of the field to be protected, which is assumed {{to act as a}} barrier for entry by pests, or they can be interspersed among the focul crop, for example being planted every ninth row. Planting crops in rows helps facilitate supplemental management practices that prevent insect pest dispersal back into the main field, [...] such as driving a vehicle above the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> which then removes insect pests by vacuuming them off of the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> row [...] or targeted insecticides, which are only deployed on the <b>trap</b> <b>crop.</b> Even if pesticides are used to control insects on the <b>trap</b> <b>crop,</b> total pesticides are greatly reduced in this scenario over conventional agricultural pesticide applications because they are only deployed on {{a small portion of the}} farm (the <b>trap</b> <b>crop).</b> Other strategies that prevent dispersal of insect pests back into the main crop include cutting the trap plants, applying predators to the trap plant that eat the pest, and planting a high ratio of trap plants to other plants.|$|E
40|$|<b>Trap</b> <b>crops</b> were {{evaluated}} {{as a part}} of a community -wide pink bollworm (PBW) control program. We measured extraordinarily high numbers of PBW larvae in the <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> in 1992, which indicated that the <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were attracting PBW moths from wide areas. However, we have no direct way of measuring any effect this would have on the main crop. Overall PBW populations were very low in 1993. While PBW numbers drastically declined in the community, this study offers no conclusive evidence as to whether <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> are an effective component of a community-wide IPM program...|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{are looking}} at <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> like sticky nightshade, Solanum sisymbriifolium in Europe. <b>Trap</b> <b>crops</b> produce egg {{hatching}} compounds that cause eggs to hatch but don’t make good hosts and the juveniles are unable {{to set up a}} feeding site.

50|$|Another way {{to utilize}} this {{research}} is to synthetically produce the compounds produced by <b>trap</b> <b>crop.</b> Up to 10 different compounds {{have been identified as}} contributing to the egg hatching factor. If these compounds can be produced and delivered to infested fields this would contribute the depletion of cyst nematode eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{cover crops}} {{are used as}} {{so-called}} [...] "trap crops", to attract pests away from the crop of value and toward what the pest sees as a more favorable habitat (Shelton and Badenes-Perez 2006). <b>Trap</b> <b>crop</b> areas can be established within crops, within farms, or within landscapes. In many cases the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> is grown during the same season as the food crop being produced. The limited area occupied by these trap crops can be treated with a pesticide once pests {{are drawn to the}} trap in large enough numbers to reduce the pest populations. In some organic systems, farmers drive over the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> with a large vacuum-based implement to physically pull the pests off the plants and out of the field (Kuepper and Thomas 2002). This system has been recommended for use to help control the lygus bugs in organic strawberry production (Zalom et al. 2001). Another example of trap crops are nematode resistance White mustard (Sinapis alba) and Radish (Raphanus sativus). They can be grown after a main (cereal) crop and trap nematodes, for example the beet cyst nematode and Columbian root knot nematode. When grown, nematodes hatch and are attracted to the roots. After entering the roots they cannot reproduce in the root due to a hypersensitive resistance reaction of the plant. Hence the nematode population is greatly reduced, by 70-99%, depending on species and cultivation time.|$|E
5000|$|Another method called <b>trap</b> <b>cropping</b> {{involves}} {{planting a}} species in an infested field that will induce the Striga seeds to germinate {{but will not}} support attachment of the parasite. This method {{has been used in}} sorghum plantations by planting Celosia argentea between the sorghum rows. Cotton, sunflower and linseed are also effective <b>trap</b> <b>crops.</b> Planting silverleaf (Desmodium uncinatum) inhibits striga seed germination and has worked effectively intercropped with maize.|$|R

Thirty four <b>trap</b> <b>crops.</b> planted fifteen days {{ahead of the}} regular crop. had as many as 39536 damaged plants/ha before insecticide treatments were initiated. Five insecticide applications at 3 day intervals beginning at square initiation were used to destroy weevils before the <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were plowed under at the time pinhead square treatments were initiated in regular planted fields. Damaged square infestations were 2 to II times lower throughout the season in 1987 compared to 1986 while average lint yields per ha increased {{from a low of}} 941 kg in 1985 to 1345 kg in 1986 and 1506 kg in 1987...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> is a {{plant that}} attracts {{agricultural}} pests, usually insects, away from nearby crops. This form of companion planting can save the main crop from decimation by pests {{without the use of}} pesticides. [...] While many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, {{only a small portion of}} these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales. A common explanation for reported trap cropping failures, is that attractive trap plants only protect nearby plants if the insects do not move back into the main crop. In a review of 100 trap cropping examples in 2006, only 10 trap crops where classified as successful at a commercial scale, [...] and in all successful cases, trap cropping was supplemented with management practices that specifically limited insect dispersal from the <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> back into the main crop.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{series of}} {{laboratory}} and glasshouse experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate different methods of testing and studying the effect of several chemicals, root exudates of germinating crop seeds, and their interactions on Orobanche cernua.

GR 24 at 0. 1 and 1. 0 mg kg- 1 was the most effective in stimulating the germination of O. cernua seeds, followed by gibberellic acid at 10 and 20 mg kg- 1. Without the addition of chemicals, <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> strongly increased germination, with green gram (Vigna radiata) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) being particularly effective. There was an interaction between the effects of chemicals and <b>trap</b> <b>crops.</b> A positive effect of <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> was observed even when there was already strong stimulation by GR 24 at 1. 0 mg kg- 1, but under these conditions, <b>trap</b> <b>crops</b> were less effective at 0. 1 mg kg- 1 GR 24. No differences between cultivars in their effect on O. cernua germination could be detected within one host plant species...|$|R
40|$|Perimeter <b>trap</b> <b>cropping</b> (PTC) {{involves}} planting {{one or more}} rows of a cucurbit crop that {{is highly}} attractive to cucumber beetles around the border of a main cucurbit cash crop that is less attractive to the beetles. Cucumber beetles attempting to migrate into the field are concentrated in the relatively more attractive border crop, {{where they can be}} controlled by insecticides. In New England, perimeter <b>trap</b> <b>cropping</b> using Blue Hubbard squash as the border crop around pumpkin, cucumber, or butternut squash controlled cucumber beetle/bacterial wilt with as few as one border spray of insecticide. This strategy reduced insecticide use on the main crop by up to 94 percent, nearly eliminating sprays on the main cash crop. In on-farm trials, 8 of 10 Massachusetts growers found that using perimeter <b>trap</b> <b>cropping</b> saved them money. The same tactic also effectively managed cucumber beetles on muskmelon and squash in Oklahoma...|$|R

5000|$|Some weeds act as trap crops, distracting pests {{away from}} valued plants.

5000|$|This {{plant has}} been used as a <b>trap</b> <b>crop</b> to protect {{potatoes}} from potato cyst nematode.

50|$|Grower {{tolerance}} for this beetle is very low, due in major {{part to the}} transmission of bacterial wilt.
