Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, {{but this time the}} Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king.

The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and <b>their</b> <b>accompanying</b> servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, Presley {{made his}} film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, {{he was drafted}} into {{military}} service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing {{some of his most}} commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and <b>their</b> <b>accompanying</b> soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result. His death came in the wake of many years of prescription drug abuse.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the receipt of}} the first order in November 1949, Hawker set about establishing a manufacturing line for the Sea Hawk at their Kingston facility. Shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, an urgent operational demand for Britain's aircraft carriers, and thus <b>their</b> <b>accompanying</b> aircraft, had become apparent. The rate of production was substantially increased, and further orders for the Sea Hawk were soon placed. The issuing of a 'Super-Priority' status for the Sea Hawk by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1951, served to speed up production considerably as well as aid the supply of vital materials for its manufacture.|$|E

Crowley had founded a religion known as Thelema based upon a spiritual experience that he had in Egypt in 1904, in which he claimed a being known as Aiwass had contacted him and recited to him The Book of the Law. Kenneth subsequently became a great fan of Crowley's work and converted to Thelema.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} some biographical facts about Campbell that are solidly documented, most {{of the details of}} her life, {{including}} incidents about her capture and adoption by the Lenape tribe, have come down to the present day through oral family traditions and written records of those traditions.

A stemmatic analysis of this, and other, traditional material, by cataloging different lines of familial descent and <b>their</b> <b>accompanying</b> traditions could possibly bring to light or clarify many incidents in Mary Campbell's life which are now unknown or not well understood by interested researchers.|$|E
