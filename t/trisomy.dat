5|$|The first World Down Syndrome Day {{was held}} on 21 March 2006. The day and month were chosen to {{correspond}} with 21 and <b>trisomy,</b> respectively. It was recognized by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS or DNS), {{also known}} as <b>trisomy</b> 21, is a genetic disorder caused {{by the presence of}} all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with <b>trisomy</b> 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{consequences of}} extensive aneuploidy in Drosophila {{have been examined}} by measuring the levels of specific proteins in larvae trisomic for entire chromosome arms. By far the most common effect is a reduction in gene product levels (per gene template) by one-third from the diploid quantity, consistent with the model that concentration-dependent repressors of these loci reside on the duplicated chromosome arms. Most loci appear sensitive to such repression {{in one or more}} of the <b>trisomies</b> examined, suggesting that such regulatory loci might be quite common. Repression of gene-product levels in <b>trisomies</b> may significantly contribute to their inviability. Few loci are activated in <b>trisomies</b> implying that most factors necessary for gene expression are in excess. While autosomal <b>trisomies</b> can repress the expression of both X-linked and autosomal loci, X-chromosomal <b>trisomies</b> have little effect on most autosomal genes. A family of genes coding for larval serum proteins do not respond similarly in <b>trisomies,</b> suggesting that regulation operates on a process which is not common to their coordinate regulation. Finally, Adh genes transposed to new chromosomal positions maintain their ability to be repressed in 3 L <b>trisomies</b> suggesting that this response to regulation involves a closely linked cis-acting regulatory element...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Until recently, {{maternal}} serum analyte levels {{paired with}} sonographic fetal nuchal translucency measurement {{was the most}} accurate prenatal screen available for <b>Trisomies</b> 18 and 21, (91 % and 94 % detection and false positive rates of 0. 31 % and 4. 5 % respectively). Women with positive California Prenatal Screening Program (CPSP) results {{have the option of}} diagnostic testing to determine definitively if the fetus has a chromosomal abnormality. Cell-free fetal (cff-) DNA screening for <b>Trisomies</b> 13, 18, and 21 was first offered in 2012, allowing women with positive screens to choose additional screening before diagnostic testing.

His inflammatory bowel disease was controlled with local steroids and sulfasalazine with only short exposure to azathioprine. His blood counts remained within normal range, but the marrow showed mild dysplasia. Repeated cytogenetic examinations revealed <b>trisomies</b> 8 and 9, which are typical for therapy related myelodysplasia. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study showed stable persistent <b>trisomies,</b> confined to the myeloid lineage, one year after discontinuation of sulfasalazine.

40|$|Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) {{protocol}} 9201 enrolled {{children with}} lesser-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) defined by age (1 - 9), {{white blood cell}} count (WBC) less than 50 × 109 /L (50 [*] 000 /μL), DNA findings of <b>trisomies</b> 4 and 10 (or DNA index > 1. 16), and lack of overt central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. After vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase induction, 650 of 653 eligible patients attained remission (3 induction deaths) and received 6 courses of intravenous methotrexate (1 g/m 2) with daily mercaptopurine. Weekly intramuscular methotrexate was added during maintenance; pulses of vincristine and prednisone were administered with periodic intrathecal chemotherapy. Treatment duration was 2. 5 years. No alkylators, epipodophylotoxins, anthracyclines, or radiation were given. The 6 -year event-free survival (EFS) was 86. 6 % with overall survival (OS) of 97. 2 %. Patients with less than 5 % marrow blasts on induction day 15 had superior EFS. A difference not reaching conventional statistical significance (P =. 068) was noted for superior outcomes in patients with <b>trisomies</b> of chromosomes 4 and 10 versus those lacking double <b>trisomies.</b> Sex, ethnicity, CNS status, and WBC were not predictive.

25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal <b>trisomy</b> 13 and <b>trisomy</b> 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal <b>trisomy</b> 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete <b>trisomy,</b> the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Somatic mosaicism {{occurs in}} {{virtually}} all cancer cells, including <b>trisomy</b> 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and <b>trisomy</b> 8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these forms of mosaic aneuploidy occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic aneuploidy, such as chromosomal instability (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore, the molecular processes that lead to aneuploidy are targets {{for the development of}} cancer drugs. Both resveratrol and aspirin have been found in vivo (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of aneuploid cells, and activate AMPK, which may be involved in the process.|$|E
40|$|Five adamantinomas of long {{bones were}} cytogenetically {{characterized}} {{to investigate the}} role of chromosomal aberrations in their histogenesis, {{as well as a}} putative relationship between adamantinoma and osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD). Three tumors had a classic histologic subtype, with abundant epithelium. Two of them revealed <b>trisomies</b> 7, 8, 12, and 19, combined with a balanced translocation, t(10; 22), with centromere breakpoints in one tumor. The third showed a karyotype 51, XY, +X, + 7, + 12, + 19, + 21. The fourth tumor, of OFD-like subtype, showed <b>trisomies</b> 7, 8, and a small marker chromosome in a low percentage of cells. The fifth tumor, also of OFD-like subtype, displayed only a few keratin-positive cells from the multiple tissue blocks investigated. This latter tumor revealed a clonal abnormality with a karyotype 46,XX,t(2; 11) (p 23;q 14) inv(11) (p 14 q 14), which was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using chromosome-specific library probes and chromosome 12 locus-specific probes. The <b>trisomies</b> 7, 8, and 22 also were described in OFD, which suggests a common histogenesis of OFD and adamantinoma. Our findings further support the probability of clonal origin of OFD. The OFD-like component may be an integral element of adamantinoma, rather than a tissue reaction to epithelial tumor cells. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc., 1997...|$|R

40|$|Pregnancy loss is {{the most}} common obstetric complication. Multiple factors have been {{associated}} with recurrent or sporadic pregnancy loss, and genetic factors, particularly at earlier gestational ages, are the most important ones. The proportion of miscarriages due to chromosomal factors decreases with increasing gestational age.

In later losses, aneuploidies are similar to those found in live newborns (<b>trisomies</b> 21, 18 and 13, X monosomy and polysomy of sex chromosomes.
