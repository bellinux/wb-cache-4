5|$|Super v. Work (1926) {{involved}} {{a challenge in}} the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now known as the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) {{to the construction of}} federal hydroelectric dams in California. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs,</b> members of the Karuk and Peh-tsick tribes, alleged both that the dams would violate their aboriginal title rights and their rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that both rights (if they existed) were extinguished by the 1851 statute. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> in Barker, who were Mission Indians, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> here were nomadic {{at the time of the}} relevant times.|$|E
5|$|While, Jones and his {{attorneys}} initially hailed the verdict {{as a victory}} for the county because of the relatively low damages award, after the judge awarded <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> an additional $1.9 million in legal fees, DeKalb County ultimately agreed to pay <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> a total of $1.3 million for legal fees and damages in April 19, 2011 post-trial settlement.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

50|$|On 3 August 1974 the {{defendants}} took an aerial photograph of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> alleged that {{in taking the}} aerial photo, {{the defendants}} had trespassed in <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> airspace. <b>The</b> defendants admitted taking the photo but claimed that they had taken it whilst flying over an adjoining property. The defendants also argued {{that if they had}} flown over <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> land, then they had <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> implied permission.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Under the {{doctrine}} of contributory negligence, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> negligence is a complete defense. If <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> negligence was a cause of <b>the</b> injury, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> is barred from recovery.|$|R
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> lacked locus standi {{to bring the}} action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|A {{wrongful}} death lawsuit was {{filed by the}} families {{of three of the}} victims in Los Angeles. After a jury found the captain and Avjet Corporation negligent, an out-of-court settlement was reached, where Avjet agreed to pay <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> a total of US$11.7M in damages. There were reportedly also other settlements for other victims.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, a {{class action}} suit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of Topeka, Kansas in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were {{thirteen}} Topeka parents {{on behalf of their}} 20 children.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> {{directed}} his servants to rake abandoned horse manure into heaps that had accumulated {{in a public}} street, intending to carry it away the next day. Before he could do so, the defendant, who {{had no knowledge of}} <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> actions, found <b>the</b> heaps and hauled them off to his own land. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> sued <b>the</b> defendant in trover demanding payment for the price of the manure. The trial court held for the defendant, stating he owed nothing to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> appealed and <b>the</b> Appellate Court of Connecticut held for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> remanding <b>the</b> case for a new trial.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> claimed {{against both}} {{defendants}} damages for passing off and for wrongful appropriation of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> personality; and, in the alternative, {{compensation for use}} of his image and personality. The defendants stated that prospective customers seeing the drawings could not recognize them as <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> and would not associate <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> with <b>the</b> camp; that no passing off was intended or accomplished and that, in any event, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> suffered no injury or damage as a result.|$|R
50|$|Given the {{defendant}} made a false statement that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> song violated <b>the</b> defendant's copyright {{when it had}} no such privilege, and <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> suffered damages, <b>the</b> judge ruled in <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> favor.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, the Southern Management Company, a firm {{responsible}} for managing residential apartments complexes, {{filed a lawsuit}} against the sheriff and the county government, with <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> alleging that they lost revenue due to the sheriff's office inability to evict tenants who were not paying their rent costs.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP's chief counsel, Thurgood Marshall—who {{was later}} {{appointed}} to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967—argued the case before the Supreme Court for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b> Assistant attorney general Paul Wilson—later distinguished emeritus {{professor of law at}} the University of Kansas—conducted the state's ambivalent defense in his first appellate argument.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> made {{a one-year}} {{employment}} {{contract with the}} defendant for labor for one year, from some time in March, 1831 to some time in March, 1832. The employment contract specified that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> would be paid $120 {{at the end of}} the contract period. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> voluntarily left his employment on December 27, 1831. The defendant refused to pay <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> and <b>the</b> jury in the Court of Common Pleas awarded <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> $95. <b>The</b> defendant appealed the jury verdict.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> {{must make}} a genuine effort to inform the {{defendant}} of the case through service of process, by which <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> delivers to <b>the</b> defendant the same documents that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> filed with <b>the</b> court.|$|R

5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial. A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> as {{custodian}} of the animal(s) may {{employ a}} veterinarian to provide necessary {{medical care for}} the animal without any additional court order. Before doing so <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> shall consult with the defendant in the action, but <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> may authorize such care without the defendant's consent. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> may not have an animal euthanized without written consent of the defendant or a court order that authorizes euthanasia upon the court's finding that the animal is suffering due to terminal illness or terminal injury. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> may place an animal with a foster care provider, who shall return the animal to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> on demand.|$|R
5000|$|For <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> to win <b>the</b> {{defamation}} claim, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> {{must prove}} that a false statement was made about <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> and published without privilege {{to a third}} party with fault or at least negligence {{on the part of}} the defendant. He must also prove that the statement was either defamatory per se or caused special harm to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> James Davis Rowland, Jr., was a {{guest in}} the {{apartment}} of the defendant, Nancy Christian. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> requested to use the bathroom, and in the bathroom injured his hand on a broken water faucet handle. The defendant had complained to the landlord about the broken handle but did not warn <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff.</b> <b>The</b> trial judge granted summary judgment {{on behalf of the}} defendant, and <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> appealed.|$|R
5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} {{the jury to}} force NASCAR to grant the {{speedway}} a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
5000|$|Timing is very {{important}} in making a motion for JMOL; the motion can be made only after the opposing party has presented its case. In civil cases, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> presents its case, then the defendant presents its case, and then <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> may present a rebuttal. So once <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> has presented its case, the defendant can move for JMOL, but <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> cannot. But once the defendant has finished presenting its case, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> can then move for JMOL, and so can the defendant.|$|R

5|$|On July 16, 2014, MacFarlane {{was served}} with a lawsuit from the {{production}} company {{of a series of}} Internet videos called Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear claiming that Ted infringes on the copyright of its videos due to the Ted bear largely matching the background story, persona, voice tone, attitude, and dialogue of the Charlie bear. The suit was dropped on March 23, 2015, after <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> withdrew the suit.|$|E
5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second was whether {{there had been an}} inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Other {{witnesses}} for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> {{included a}} former maid of Brownlee's, who testified {{that she had}} seen the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E

50|$|Rei vindicatio is a {{legal action}} by which <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> demands that <b>the</b> {{defendant}} return a thing that belongs to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff.</b> It may only be used when <b>plaintiff</b> owns <b>the</b> thing, and the defendant is somehow impeding <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> possession of <b>the</b> thing. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> could also institute an actio furti (a personal action) to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> could claim damages from the defendant {{with the aid of}} the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> could claim damages from the defendant. Rei vindicatio was derived from the ius civile, therefore was only available to Roman citizens.|$|R
