The sample consisted of 520 youths who had been referred to the juvenile probation service by court. The present study showed <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WSJCA pre-screen in the Netherlands to be modest too, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of. 625. Modifying the scoring procedure by means of chi-squared automatic interaction detector analyses significantly improved <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> to an AUC of. 702. The modified scoring procedure is time-saving because only variables that uniquely contribute to the prediction of recidivism are included, which at the same time leads to a more accurate prediction of recidivism...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} dynamicity of job {{performance}} criteria has found evidence suggesting {{the presence of}} rank-order changes to job performance scores across {{time as well as}} intraindividual trajectories in job performance scores across time. These findings have influenced a large body of research into (a) <b>the</b> dynamicity <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> individual differences predictors of job performance and (b) the relationship between individual differences predictors of job performance and intraindividual trajectories of job performance. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues {{within the context of the}} Five Factor Model of personality. The Five Factor Model is arranged hierarchically, with five broad higher-order factors subsuming a number of more narrowly tailored personality facets. Research has debated the relative merits of broad versus narrow traits for predicting job performance, but the entire body of research has addressed the issue from a static perspective [...] by examining <b>the</b> relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets. While research along these lines has been enlightening, theoretical perspectives suggest that <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets may differ in their stability across time. Thus, research is needed to not only compare <b>the</b> relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets at a single point in time, but also to compare <b>the</b> relative stability <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets across time. Also necessary to advance cumulative knowledge concerning intraindividual performance trajectories is research into broad vs. narrow traits for predicting such trajectories. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues using a four-year longitudinal design. The results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global conscientiousness were stable across time, while <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> conscientiousness facets were more likely to fluctuate. However, <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> emotional stability and extraversion facets were no more likely to fluctuate across time than those of the factors. Finally, while some personality factors and facets predicted performance intercepts (i. e., performance at the first measurement occasion), my results failed to indicate a significant effect of any personality variable on performance growth. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R
