In contrast to value added tax, they are mainly specific taxes, i. e. expressed as a monetary amount per quantity of the product. The most commonly applied excise duties are those on alcoholic beverages, manufactured tobacco products and energy products (motor fuels and heating fuels, such as petrol and gasoline, electricity, natural gas, coal and coke). The basic principles applicable to all products subject to excise duties have been laid down in Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. Products subject to excise duties are generally produced, and can afterwards be held under duty suspension, in <b>tax</b> <b>warehouses.</b> The establishment and operation of <b>tax</b> <b>warehouses</b> is subject to the authorization of the Member States. They should respect the principles laid down in Commission Recommendation 2000 / 789 /EC of 29 November 2000 setting out guidelines for the authorisation of warehousekeepers under Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC in relation to products subject to excise duty. The products can be sent under [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceData {{warehousing}} and OLAP applications must nowadays handle {{complex data}} that are not only numerical or symbolic. The XML language is well-suited to logically and physically represent complex data. However, its usage induces new theoretical and practical challenges at the modeling, storage and analysis levels; and a new trend toward XML warehousing has been emerging {{for a couple of}} years. Unfortunately, no standard XML data warehouse architecture emerges. In this paper, we propose a unified XML <b>warehouse</b> <b>reference</b> model that synthesizes and enhances related work, and fits into a global XML warehousing and analysis approach we have developed. We also present a software platform that is based on this model, as well as a case study that illustrates its usage...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the amount of data stored on {{computer}} systems is growing at an accelerated rate. These data are frequently managed within data warehouses. However, the current data warehouse architectures based on n-ary-Relational DBMSs are overcoming their limits in order to efficiently manage such large amounts of data. Some DBMS are able to load huge amounts of data nevertheless; the response times become unacceptable for business users during information retrieval. In this paper we describe an alternative data <b>warehouse</b> <b>reference</b> architectural configuration (ADW) which addresses many issues that organisations are facing. The ADW approach considers a Binary-Relational DBMS as an underlying data repository. Therefore, a number of improvements have been achieved, such as data density increment, reduction of data sparsity, query response times dramatically decreased, and significant workload reduction with data loading, backup and restore tasks...|$|R

The complex, officially known as the Newport Pier <b>Tax</b> Keeping <b>Warehouse</b> (Shinkō Futō Hozei Sōko), was originally used as customs buildings, and has two sections: Warehouse No.1 and No.2. It is operated by Yokohama Akarenga Co. Ltd., and located at the Port of Yokohama in Naka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} use a new concept of ceiling rooted storage systems in high rack <b>warehouses,</b> <b>reference</b> trajectories have to be {{provided}} {{to ensure that the}} swing of the crane system is under control during the movement and disappears at the final point. These trajectories can be obtained solving optimal control problems (OCP). For industrial usage alternative trajectories have to be calculated in order to bring the crane system to a rest position at a free location from any state of the main trajectory. In this thesis it is shown, how this safety requirement led to bilevel OCPs and their numerical solution. Bilevel OCPs are an extension of classical OCPs. Hereby, for the optimization of a control variable of the primary problem, an additional constraint has to be considered, which depends on the optimal solution of a secondary OCP. Replacing the secondary problem by its KKT conditions, the bilevel OCP can be reduced to a classical OCP, which is equivalent under some assumptions...|$|R

He was cited as an archetypical victim of changes in the publishing industry during the late 1980s, which accelerated during the 1990s, that made it more difficult for well-regarded [...] "mid-list" [...] writers such as Kinsella to remain in print. Changes to the U.S. tax code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 discouraged publishers from maintaining inventories of titles in their back lists, as they were <b>taxed</b> on <b>warehoused</b> books.|$|R

40|$|Data Warehouses are {{increasing}} their data volume at an accelerated rate; high disk space consumption; slow query response time and complex database administration are common problems in these environments. The {{lack of a}} proper data model and an adequate architecture specifically targeted towards these environments are {{the root causes of}} these problems. Inefficient management of stored data includes duplicate values at column level and poor management of data sparsity which derives from a low data density, and affects the final size of Data Warehouses. It has been demonstrated that the Relational Model and Relational technology are not the best techniques for managing duplicates and data sparsity. The novelty of this research is to compare some data models considering their data density and their data sparsity management to optimise Data Warehouse environments. The Binary-Relational, the Associative/Triple Store and the Transrelational models have been investigated and based on the research results a novel Alternative Data <b>Warehouse</b> <b>Reference</b> architectural configuration has been defined. For the Transrelational model, no database implementation existed. Therefore it was necessary to develop an instantiation of it’s storage mechanism, and as far as could be determined this is the first public domain instantiation available of the storage mechanism for the Transrelational model.

50|$|Much of Houston's {{success as}} a {{petrochemical}} complex is due to its busy man-made ship channel, the Port of Houston. The port ranks first {{in the country in}} international commerce and is the sixth-largest port in the world. Amid other U.S. ports, it is the busiest in foreign tonnage and second in overall tonnage. Because of these economic trades, many residents have moved to Houston from other U.S. states, as well as hundreds of countries worldwide.The coffee companies of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000.

40|$|The key {{objective}} of the paper is to identify and assess the administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria according to the selected national laws related to the EU Internal Market. The study relies on objective data and analytical frameworks {{with a view to}} identify and assess the information obligations stemming from selected laws and regulations, including national rules implementing or transposing European legislation. This is an important step in strengthening Bulgaria’s national policy on better regulation for businesses. Information obligations are those arising from regulation to provide information and data to the public sector or third parties. Administrative burdens represent the “extra” administrative costs linked to collecting and providing information that businesses would not normally have to do {{in the absence of a}} legal obligation. While regulation is important and necessary, these additional costs represent a burden for businesses. It is a burden for business both in terms of money and time, which diverts resources from productive investments and generally discourages entrepreneurship. The methodology used in the paper is based on the Standard Cost Model for Estimating Administrative Costs established for assessing administrative costs imposed by the EU legislation. The paper is developed taking into account the findings of the OECD and the European Commission. The study outlines the results of the administrative costs and administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria of totally measured 742 information obligations (IOs) in 16 national laws and regulations to them in 9 selected priority areas during 2013. Even though the study is limited to specific legal acts and to an assessment of costs to business, the results are helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which the administrative costs and administrative burdens accrue. All IOs identified and verified in the paper, related both to national rules implementing or transposing European legislation, are distinguished by specific laws and by specific priority areas. The data collection methods include interviews with business entities (field work) and expert assessments. The results obtained from the study show that more than half of all IOs examined in the paper are concentrated in three selected national laws – the Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act, the Law on Statistics and the Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment. More than half of all IOs are associated with implementation of national requirements related to the EU Internal Market. As concerns the value of the administrative burden, the highest share of administrative burden of all identified and evaluated IOs is observed under the Excise Duties and <b>Tax</b> <b>Warehouses</b> Act and the Law on Support for Farmers. The lowest share of the administrative burden of all IOs is found under those laws where the identified and assessed IOs are only a few (the Law on Social Assistance, the Bulgarian Chamber of Builders Act, the Independent Assessors Act and the Cadastre and Land Registry Act) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Bachelor thesis was to find {{efficient}} energy solutions within warehouse operations. This was achieved by {{looking for ways to}} increase energy efficiency but also by investigating the possibilities to produce own renewable energy. Our aim was to include a financial perspective. We intended to fulfill our purpose by answering the following questions: 1. How can energy efficiency in warehouse operations be improved in a cost effective way? 2. Would it be profitable for a warehouse to produce renewable energy in order to become self- sufficient? The thesis was conducted as a case study, and we used an abductive method for compiling the results. We visited our <b>reference</b> <b>warehouse</b> once; where we had an open interview as well as an observational walk around the facilities. This was {{to be able to get}} a clear picture on what possibilities there were, and what had already been accomplished. The thesis focuses on possibilities on energy efficiency through sensors for control of lighting. When it comes to renewable energy production, we focused on solar cells and wind power. The selection on alternative was based upon the preconditions of our <b>reference</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Our conclusions are that sensors should definitely be installed in all general areas as well as in the warehouse facilities. If a warehouse wants to produce their own renewable energy, solar cells covering all energy use are a good alternative. Today, it is not profitable to invest in systems or resources that produce more energy than needed. Our thesis contributes to the limited research on energy efficiency and renewable energy production within warehouse operations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{depicts the}} {{agricultural}} policy reforms and structural changes in Bangladesh from independence {{to the present}} times. Bangladesh agriculture has experienced major structural changes and achieved major successes {{over the last three}} and a half decades. Reforms began in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s by liberalizing the input markets. Both domestic and trade policy got a vibration of liberalization in the early 1990 s. After the independence, Bangladesh followed a highly restrictive trade and exchange rate policy characterized by import regulations, high import tariffs, export taxes, persistent quantitative restrictions and an overvalued exchange rate. With a decade long half-hearted attempt towards trade liberalization, the democratic government in 1991 took courageous steps towards reforming the trade regime. Reforms instigated during this period included reducing and compressing tariffs, implementing and publishing a less complicated import tax structure, gradually eliminating non-tariff import restrictions, and promoting exports through income <b>tax</b> exemptions, bonded <b>warehousing,</b> and flexible exchange rate management. The recent Import-Export Policy 2009 - 2012 is a major step to the continuation of the liberalization of international trade. ...|$|R
