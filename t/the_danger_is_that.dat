A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys." [...] Tocqueville, in contrast to previous political thinkers, argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were [...] "too weak" [...] and felt powerless; <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people felt [...] "swept up in something that they could not control", according to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville.|$|E

2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other kilovolt electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 â€“ 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse. [...] At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. [...] <b>The</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless. [...] Teachers and hobbyists demonstrating small Tesla coils often impress their audience by touching the high voltage terminal or allowing the streamer arcs to pass through their body.|$|E

[...] "In the past {{it has always been}} the BBC that has been ready to abandon its schedules to suit historic public events: yesterday, however, the traditional roles were reversed and it was the BBC that persevered with Dr. Finlay's Casebook and The Black and White Minstrel Show while independent television showed itself far more flexible and enterprising." [...] He praised Frost for the way he [...] "chaired the proceedings with his usual unflappable professionalism" [...] and Burnett for [...] "combining straight news with personal comment", though he said [...] "the combination of news and variety is more debatable. There is certainly something a bit strange about going straight from a discussion about the orbit of Luna 15 to hearing Cilla Black singing her latest recording. On balance, I think this type of juxtaposition is justified, if only because some point of rest is needed in a programme of this length. <b>The</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the viewer will be so saturated with information that his responses will be blunted {{when it comes to the}} moments of real excitement: pop music, however, provides the necessary let-up and fulfills much the same function as comic relief in a five-act drama.|$|E

5000|$|The new {{long-range}} artillery developed {{just before}} the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was.

60|$|But {{surely there}} are other {{securities}} upon which the stability of society depends. In the ever-increasing complexities of social problems, in the restrictions which are imposed {{from day to day}} with increasing force on the action of individuals, above all, in the dissemination of property among many classes of the population, lie the real elements of stability on which our modern society depends. There are to-day, unlike in former ages, actually millions of people who possess not merely inert property, but who possess rent-earning, profit-bearing property; and the danger with which we are confronted now is not at all whether we shall go too fast. No, <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> about three-fourths of {{the people of this country}} should move on in a comfortable manner into an easy life, which, with all its ups and downs, is not uncheered by fortune, while the remainder of the people shall be left to rot and fester in the slums of our cities, or wither in the deserted and abandoned hamlets of our rural districts.|$|E
60|$|One preconception will bewilder {{the spectator}} hopelessly unless {{he has been}} warned against it or is {{naturally}} free from it. In the old-fashioned orders of creation, the supernatural personages are invariably conceived as greater than man, for good or evil. In the modern humanitarian order as adopted by Wagner, Man is the highest. In The Rhine Gold, it is pretended that there are as yet no men on the earth. There are dwarfs, giants, and gods. <b>The</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you will jump {{to the conclusion that}} the gods, at least, are a higher order than the human order. On the contrary, the world is waiting for Man to redeem it from the lame and cramped government of the gods. Once grasp that; and the allegory becomes simple enough. Really, of course, the dwarfs, giants, and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes.|$|E

There is nothing of which your Philadelphia architect is so afraid as of monotony. In fact {{it is the only}} architectural defect of which he seems to go in fear.

Now the first thing I notice about this scheme {{is that it is}} founded on combination. Its proposers are right in assuming the necessity for this, if their purpose is to secure economical success; but such success can be bought at too high a price. Carry the cooperative idea out to its logical conclusion, and a man becomes a machine. He must subordinate his private judgment, he cannot choose his course, all his movements must be regulated by central control. Then you may get efficiency, but you destroy character, independence, personal responsibility, all the finest attributes of human nature. You may object that I am exaggerating; that nobody wants this. <b>The</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if you decide to go some distance, you may be driven farther than you think. Then, Allenwood was founded to encourage individual liberty--that settlers here might live a healthy life, free from economic pressure; on their own land, farming it like gentlemen, and not with bitter greed; enjoying the wind and sunshine, finding healthy sport.

60|$|The {{shortening}} of {{the general}} hours of work, then, should be among the primary aims of social reform. There need be no fear that with shortened hours of labor {{the sum total of}} production would fall short of human needs. This, as has been shown from beginning to end of this essay, is out of the question. Human desires would eat up the result of ten times the work we now accomplish. Human needs would be satisfied with a fraction of it. But the real difficulty in the shortening of hours lies elsewhere. Here, as in the parallel case of the minimum wage, <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the attempt to alter things too rapidly may dislocate the industrial machine. We ought to attempt such a shortening as will strain the machine to a breaking point, but never break it. This can be done, as with the minimum wage, partly by positive legislation and partly collective action. Not much can be done at once. But the process can be continuous. The short hours achieved with acclamation to-day will later be denounced as the long hours of to-morrow. The essential point to grasp, however, is that society at large has nothing to lose by the process. The shortened hours {{become a part of the}} framework of production. It adapts itself to it. Hitherto we have been caught in the running of our own machine: it is time that we altered the gearing of it.|$|E
