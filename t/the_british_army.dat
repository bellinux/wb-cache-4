5|$|<b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> during World War I {{fought the}} largest and most costly war in its long history. Unlike the French and German Armies, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> was made up {{exclusively}} of volunteers—as opposed to conscripts—at the beginning of the conflict. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> was considerably smaller than its French and German counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Braithwaite {{remained}} in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> {{after the war}} and commanded a brigade in <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> of the Rhine. While stationed in Germany, he wrote a foreword for one of the regimental histories of the NZEF. He relinquished his temporary rank of brigadier general in 1920, and reverted to his substantive rank of colonel to take up a brigade command in the Territorial Force. He eventually retired from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> in November 1925, with the honorary rank of brigadier general. He died in Camberley, Surrey, on 15 October 1937, survived by his wife and children. Braithwaite Street in the Wellington suburb of Karori is named for him.|$|E

5|$|Violence {{reached a}} peak on 12 August 1969, {{culminating}} in the Battle of the Bogside—a three-day pitched battle between residents and the RUC. On 14 August units of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> were deployed {{at the edge of}} the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn. The Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> until their demands were met. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> made no attempt to enter the area. The situation continued until October 1969 when, following publication of the Hunt Report, military police were allowed in.|$|E

It then fought through Italy and, {{with the help of}} American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British.

5|$|Although {{the primary}} role of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> {{was to protect}} the colonies against {{external}} attack, no actual threat ever materialised. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>Army</b> was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions—as occurred at Bathurst in 1830—and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers {{were involved in the}} battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields.
