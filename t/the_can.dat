5|$|The four-lane I-590 becomes NY590 upon passing under I-490 at <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> of Worms on {{the eastern}} edge of Rochester. It heads {{northeast}} into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY286A. Between Blossom Road and NY286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester–Brighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY286.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> of Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of investigations, the {{structural}} changes in proteins were established, which {{were associated with the}} preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by <b>the</b> end of <b>canned</b> food storage duration. Upon sterilization, the losses in protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction in canned foods was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction in <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. In <b>the</b> sterilized <b>canned</b> foods, <b>the</b> processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during canned food storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of the pH value in the used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ in the pH value of <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods toward <b>the</b> acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of the shiﬅ in <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in sour cream sauce. When sterilizing canned foods, another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units in <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units in <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in sour cream sauce. During storage, the tendency of more intense pH decline was revealed for <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization compared to <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods aﬅer sterilization. Another character of the pH value dynamics was found in <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods in sour cream sauce: an insigniﬁcant increase (by 0. 7 %) of the pH value in <b>the</b> pasteurized <b>canned</b> foods and a signiﬁcant decrease (by 8. 4 %) in <b>the</b> sterilized <b>canned</b> foods were observed by the end of storage. </p...|$|R

5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|French {{involvement}} in Vietnam {{started in the}} late 18th century when the Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine assisted Nguyễn Ánh, to found the Nguyễn Dynasty by recruiting French volunteers. In return, Nguyen Anh, who took the reign name Gia Long allowed Catholic missionaries to operate in Vietnam. However, relations became strained under Gia Long's successor Minh Mạng as missionaries sought to incite revolts {{in an attempt to}} enthrone a Catholic. This prompted anti-Christian edicts, and in 1858, a French invasion of Vietnam was mounted, ostensibly to protect Catholicism, but in reality for colonial purposes. The French steadily made gains and completed the colonisation of Vietnam in 1883. Armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly, most notably through <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Vương movement of the late-1880s. In the early-20th century, the 1916 southern revolts and the Thái Nguyên uprising were notable disruptions to the French administration.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E

5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in <b>the</b> <b>can.</b> Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1883, Gaudí {{designed}} the Santísimo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San Félix de Alella, {{as well as}} some topographical plans for <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the Cantabrian town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by Máximo Díaz de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Cristòfor Cascante i Colom, Gaudí's fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower {{in the shape of a}} Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large sash window, and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.|$|E
5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two connections that exit3 omits—before I-590 enters <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490.

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> of Worms and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan {{almost lost}} his life during a power {{struggle}} in the imperial court. The regent Tôn Thất Thuyết disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam {{and made it a}} part of French Indochina. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Vương movement, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam had {{gradually}} {{become a}} French colony between 1859 and 1883. The first phase started in 1859, when French and Spanish] forces began {{an invasion of}} southern Vietnam, leading to the ceding of three southern provinces to form the colony of Cochinchina under the Treaty of Saigon in 1864. In 1867, the French seized three further provinces and by 1883, the process was complete, when northern and central Vietnam were conquered and made into the French protectorates of Tonkin and Annam and incorporated into French Indochina. Initially, military resistance to French rule came through <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Vương movement led by Tôn Thất Thuyết and Phan Đình Phùng, which sought to install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi {{at the head of}} an independent nation. However, with the death of Phùng in 1895, military opposition effectively ended. The only other notable incidents after this came in 1917 with the Thái Nguyên uprising. The lack of militant activity changed in the late 1920s with the formation of the VNQDĐ, or Vietnamese Nationalist Party. The party began to generate attention among French colonial authorities and was blamed for the assassination of Bazin on 9 February 1929, a French labour recruiter despised among the populace, leading to a heavy French crackdown. The French purges caused considerable detriment to the independence movement in general and the VNQDĐ in particular. Nearly 1000 VNQDĐ members were arrested; the demolition of many of the Party's facilities ensued. The VNQDĐ decided to abandon its clandestine philosophy and engage in open attacks against the French, hoping to foment a general uprising among the people. Since the VNQDĐ was only strong in the northern areas of Vietnam, the attacks were to be staged in the Red River Delta, and the garrison at Yen Bay was identified as a key point. The French authorities used Vietnamese soldiers and VNQDĐ members were among the garrison at Yen Bay; they engaged in cajoling their colleagues with revolutionary rhetoric.|$|E
