500|$|On September 17, 1846, Josephite Malo-Galipeau {{joined the}} community, {{bringing}} {{with her a}} large endowment of funds left to her by her late husband, which substantially enriched the community. Despite these additional funds {{the women of the}} Hospice were still forced <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> outside the hospice to make ends meet. Cadron-Jetté during this time undertook occasional work as a shoemaker. [...] Elections were held within the community on November 6, 1846, with the result of Cadron-Jetté being appointed as the new superior for a period of one year, with Malo-Galipeau named as her assistant. From December 1, 1846, the women of the community began wearing a religious habit at the direction of Bishop Prince.|$|E
2500|$|A young intern, {{he works}} very hard {{but does not}} always get proper recognition. Asok is {{intensely}} intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his optimistic illusions becomes frequent comic fodder. He is Indian, and has graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). The other workers, especially the boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs. [...] On the occasions when Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored. His test scores (a perfect 1600 on the old SAT) and his IQ of 240 show {{that he is the}} smartest member of the engineering team. Nonetheless he is often called upon by the Boss <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs,</b> and in meetings his ideas are usually left hanging. He is also seen regularly at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, experiencing jarring realizations of the nature of corporate life. There are a few jokes about his psychic powers, which he learned at the IIT. Yet despite his intelligence, ethics and mystical powers, Asok sometimes takes advice from Wally in the arts of laziness, and from Dilbert in surviving the office. As of February 7, 2014, Asok is officially gay, which never impacts any storylines but merely commemorates a decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold an anti-gay law.|$|E
60|$|As for the poor, {{they seemed}} to have utterly disappeared. All those who had {{depended}} upon charity for their daily bread were now at work in some way or other; many of them offering <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> for their neighbors {{just for the sake of}} their meals,--a thing which before had been seldom heard of in the town. The Griffin could find no one who needed his assistance.|$|E
25|$|Doheny and Canfield {{together}} {{worked the}} former’s Mount Chief Mine with little success. In 1886, Canfield prospected {{further in the}} Kingston area, leasing and developing with great success the Comstock Mine (not {{to be confused with}} the Comstock Lode of Virginia City, Nevada). Doheny declined to join him in this venture, but Canfield made a small fortune from it. Doheny was eventually reduced <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> (including painting) <b>to</b> support his family.|$|R

Although not {{tough on}} the side of action, he feels better suited <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> for his friends, such as {{cleaning}} the dishes and mopping the floor. A good friend of X-Ray Boy, Gower Goose has also had a crush on Mooncat, a member of Tomb Team. Outside his megahero image, Gower Goose is a radio presenter for his own radio station, WUCK (Named after his catchphrase). Gower Goose looks very similar in appearance to Howard the Duck.|$|R

60|$|Lady Wetherby {{turned on}} him with some violence. His {{detached}} attitude was the most irritating of the many irritating aspects of the situation. She paid this man a weekly wage <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> The capture of Eustace was essentially an odd job. Yet, instead of doing it, he hung about with the air of one who has paid his half-dollar and bought his bag of peanuts and has now {{nothing to do but}} look on and enjoy himself.|$|E
60|$|This {{event was}} the {{concrete}} result of Winterborne's thoughts {{during the past}} week or two. The want of success with his evening party he had accepted in as philosophic a mood as he was capable of; {{but there had been}} enthusiasm enough left in him one day at Sherton Abbas market to purchase this old mare, which had belonged to a neighboring parson with several daughters, and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or a lady, and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> of carting and agriculture at a pinch. This obliging quadruped seemed to furnish Giles with a means of reinstating himself in Melbury's good opinion as a man of considerateness by throwing out future possibilities to Grace.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, I think so. When {{they see}} that a fellow is willing and anxious to learn, it is sure to do him good in the long run. It will help him on, and perhaps {{in two or three}} years he may get rated as an able seaman, and no longer be {{regarded}} as a boy, useful only <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> One of the midshipmen is going to give me some help with my navigation. I wish, Tom, you would take it up too, but I am afraid it would be no use. You have got to learn a tremendous lot before you can master it, and what little you were taught at our school would hardly help you at all.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Elizabeth Keckley (1818-1907) was {{a former}} slave who managed to {{establish}} a successful career as a dressmaker who catered to the Washington political elite after obtaining her freedom. However, soon after publishing Behind the Scenes; or, Thirty Years as a Slave and Four Years in the White House, she lost her job and found herself reduced <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs.</b> Although she acknowledged the cruelties of her enslavement and her resentment towards it, Keckley chose to focus her narrative on the incidents that [...] "moulded her character", and on how she proved herself [...] "worth her salt". Behind the Scenes details Keckley's life in slavery, her work for Mary Todd Lincoln and her efforts to obtain her freedom. Keckley was also deeply committed to programs of racial improvement and protection and helped found the Home for Destitute Women and Children in Washington, D.C., as a result. In addition to this, Keckley taught at Wilberforce University in Ohio.|$|R
60|$|They {{had been}} {{travelling}} {{with a large}} party for mutual security against Indians and Mormons, and {{so long as the}} journey lasted Dick had got on fairly well. He was always ready <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>odd</b> <b>jobs,</b> and as the draught cattle were growing weaker and weaker, and every pound of weight was of importance, no one grudged him his rations in return for his services; but when the company began to descend the slopes of the Sierra Nevada they began to break up, going off by twos and threes to the diggings, of which they heard such glowing accounts. Some, however, kept straight on to Sacramento, determining there to obtain news as to the doings at all the different places, and then to choose that which seemed to offer the best prospects of success.|$|E

50|$|Later, Eve {{would find}} out from Gordon {{that the reason for}} Amanda's lack of {{intimacy}} stemmed from watching Lucille being raped by a man, when Amanda was a young girl. But Lucille was apparently harboring more secrets than that, because when Ben tried to show his art work at the Binnoker art gallery to raise funds to send Eve to college to fulfill her dream of becoming a teacher (as her mother had been), Lucille secretly burned down the gallery. With no funds to send Eve to school, Lucille hired Ben and Eve <b>to</b> <b>do</b> various <b>odd</b> <b>jobs</b> around the main house at the Wexler Estate, and Ben got a job at Spaulding Enterprises as a graphic artist.
