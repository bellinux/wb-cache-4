5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into <b>the</b> <b>Tenant</b> League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and <b>the</b> <b>Tenant</b> League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of <b>the</b> <b>Tenant</b> League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E

5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. <b>The</b> <b>tenant</b> of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{listed in the}} Court of Common Pleas as Tichborne v. Lushington, {{in the form of}} an action for the {{ejectment}} of Colonel Lushington, <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> of Tichborne Park. The real purpose, however, was to establish the Claimant's identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family's estates; failure on his part would expose him as an impostor. In addition to Tichborne Park's , the estates included manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over £20,000, equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms.|$|E
5|$|Unmentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Royton {{does not}} appear in records until 1212, when it was {{documented}} to have been a thegnage estate, or manor, comprising twelve oxgangs of land, with an annual rate of 24shillings payable by <b>the</b> <b>tenant,</b> William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from this exchange that the Byron family came to use Royton as their chief place of residence until {{the early part of the}} 17th century.|$|E
50|$|As {{the tables}} show the {{production}} in the project was very disappointing. If it is taken into account that no cowpeas and groundnuts have been planted, the picture becomes even worse. A mid-term review in 1985 projected a cash income for <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> between Kshs 5,000 and 6,000 for the year 1984. For the years after 1985 it calculated an income of Kshs 7,400 (55% of the appraisal estimate in real terms) if the cotton yield would be 2,500 kg. With an average yield of 2,005 for the years 1982-1989, the cash income would have been about Kshs 5,620 or almost 40% of the appraisal estimate.In 1986 75% of <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> received a cash income and 25% nothing. In 1989 only 35% of <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> received a cash income and following year only 20% of <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> received an cash income.

5|$|El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving {{contracts}} mention him as <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> from 1585 onwards of {{a complex}} consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed {{the rest of his}} life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle {{became the}} scene {{of one of the}} most desperate sieges during the English Civil War in the 1640s, which saw the rival factions of Parliament and the king vie for power across England. In the years before the war, there had been a {{resurgence}} of building at the castle. Richard Tyler, a local lawyer, became <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> and constable of the castle, and during the early 1630s there had been considerable renovation work. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Earl of Stamford, with support from Tyler, garrisoned the castle for Parliament until December 1643, when increasing Royalist pressure in the region forced his withdrawal to Gloucester. The castle was then occupied by a garrison led by the Royalist Sir Henry Lingen. The occupation was not peaceful, with Royalist troops burning surrounding farm buildingsTyler himself was imprisoned by Lingen, although not before he had begun to sell off his livestock and other moveable property. Some references to Goodrich Castle during this period refer to it as Guthridge Castle, a variant on the name Goodrich.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E

On the 15th, limited operations began at Limestone, as Cold War tensions began to heat up. The next day, a B-36 Peacemaker arrived and later departed. 1 July brought the re-designation of the Limestone Detachment as the 4215th Base Service Squadron. After the Korean War broke out, {{the decision was}} made to increase the squadron's size to 28 officers, 340 airmen, and 20 civilians. August brought the first permanently assigned aircraft, a C-47 Skytrain, and more aircraft using the base as a stopover between the States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|As a landlord, Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner {{to improve the quality of}} life of those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts as a result of his uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E
5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E

25|$|Houses {{were usually}} leased for the year, {{but also for}} longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The {{contract}} generally specified that the house be in good repair, and <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> was bound to keep it so.
