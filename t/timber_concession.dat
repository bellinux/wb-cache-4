50|$|Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub {{was known}} for using his chief {{minister}} power to distribute state resources to his clients. In return, the clients would finance his electoral campaign during state elections. This is to ensure the loyalty of his clients to his leadership. Zainuddin Satem, Salleh Jafaruddin (Rahman's nephew), Wan Habib Syed Mahmud (Rahman's nephew), Wan Madzihi Madzar (Rahman's nephew), Daniel Tajem were among the recipients of <b>timber</b> <b>concessions.</b> He also gave some <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> to his family members namely Norlia Abdul Rahman (daughter), Khadijah Abdul Rahman (daughter), and Jamil Abdullah (Rahman's brother-in-law). A case study in Belaga district revealed that the shares of the Lembahan Mewah timber licence was 70% owned by his daughters while the remaining 30% of shares was owned by the wife of Datuk Tajang Laing, the state assemblyman for Belaga district. Among the Rahman-linked companies that had received <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> were Baltim <b>Timber</b> Sdn Bhd, Syarikat Delapan Sdn Bhd, Barbet Sdn Bhd, and Lembahan Mewah Sdn Bhd.|$|R
50|$|Taib {{also started}} to {{reshuffle}} his cabinet in 1985 by creating three new ministries and abolishing two others.

40|$|Extensive {{areas of}} the Congo Basin forest are {{allocated}} to timber concessionaires. These forests also harbour and support village populations, including indigenous Baka people, who depend on forest foods obtained directly from trees (fruits, oils and caterpillars). Most food-producing tree species are harvested by concessionaires for timber. We documented the availability and abundance of three food tree species around four villages and in two neighboring <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> in Cameroon. Data {{was used to determine}} the importance of <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> as sources of food for local people to provide a foundation for governance arrangements that consider local needs for foods from timber trees. Discussions with concessionaires revealed that some of them have voluntarily refrained from extracting timber species of interest to villagers for their nontimber products. This is either to avoid conflict with villagers, or because regulations have been promulgated to safeguard these resources. The interplay between internal village dynamics, regulations and their implementation by forest guards, and the actions of <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> create a complex arena for addressing rights to forest resources. This paper provides information on the accessibility and availability of multiple use timber species as a foundation for negotiations and governance arrangements between concessionaires and local communities.

40|$|Forest and {{peatland}} {{fires in}} Indonesia emit {{large quantities of}} smoke leading to poor air quality across Equatorial Asia. Marlier et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 085005) explore the contribution of fires occurring on oil palm, timber (wood pulp and paper) and natural forest logging concessions to smoke emissions and exposure of human populations to the resulting air pollution. They find that {{one third of the}} population exposure to smoke across Equatorial Asia is caused by fires in oil palm and <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Logging concessions have substantially lower fire emissions, and contribute less to air quality degradation. This represents a compelling justification to prevent reclassification of logging concessions into oil palm or <b>timber</b> <b>concessions</b> after logging. This can be achieved by including logged forests in the Indonesian moratorium on new plantations in forested areas...|$|R
5000|$|Cooroy was a logging centre {{well before}} it was a town. Development of the Noosa area was {{underway}} by the mid 1860s with timber getters active along the Noosa River and Kin Kin Creek, and the now heritage-listed Mill Point sawmill was established [...] at Lake Cootharaba to supply the Gympie goldfield with timber. As timber supplies close to the coast were depleted, the timber-getters moved inland. The land around Cooroy {{was part of a}} 5,000 acre 023ha <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> held by the sawmilling company Dath Henderson and Bartholomew from the mid 1880s until 1907, at which point the government repurchased the land and opened it for selection.|$|E
50|$|A {{government}} {{purchase of}} the railway from Biboohra to Mount Molloy had been looming for some time. In 1910 Moffat had approached the Queensland Government, asking for £40,000 (the line had cost about £46,600); and in late March 1913, a deputation of Mount Molloy locals to the Railway Commissioner pointed out that if the line was torn up {{as a result of}} the company's liquidation, it would be disastrous for those who had already settled in the vicinity. In the end, Moffat received £17,500, the government taking over the line on 1 March 1917 under the Mount Molloy Railway Act 1917. At this time the extension on the <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> ended. The government also took over the Chillagoe Company and its assets in June 1919.|$|E
50|$|On 15 July 2010 at an {{international}} meeting on orangutan conservation in Bali the Indonesian forestry ministry secretary general Boen Purnama announced that the Indonesian government will grant a permit to BOS to reserve thousands of hectares of forest formerly used for logging {{for the release of}} around 200 orangutans in the Kutai area in East Kalimantan. The forest will need to be restored before it can be used for conservation. In response, BOS set up a company, PT Orangutan Habitat Restoration Indonesia (ROI), to restore 86,450 hectares of former <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> area in the East Kutai district, to be the new home for rehabilitated orangutans.

50|$|However, {{the right}} to cut timber meant that the new railway at least had {{something}} to transport, as the smelters had closed {{by the end of}} 1908 for lack of ore, and the mine itself closed in late 1910. The 5 year <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> allowed Mount Molloy Ltd to stay afloat, and in the company's report for the half year to 31 December 1908, presented in April 1909, it was stated that contract teamsters were hauling timber from the company's concession. In addition, a bullock team, two horse teams and a traction engine were under company control. The timber extracted included hickory, cadagi, kauri pine, and red cedar; over 2 million super feet of logs were delivered to the depot, while 882,574 super feet were despatched by rail during the half year.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1896, King Kojong of Korea {{was persuaded}} by Yuri Briner, a Russian {{merchant}} based in Vladivostok to grant a <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> along the Yalu River border between Korea and Manchuria. Briner offered {{to sell the}} concession to the Russian government in 1897. In 1898, Bezobrazov was introduced in person to Tsar Nicholas II by Grand Duke Aleksandr Mikhailovich Romanov, along with Bezobrazov’s cousin, Rear Admiral Alexey Abaza. This formed the core of what was later called the “Bezobazov Circle”, along with Dowager Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, Prince Felix Yusupov, Mikhail Rodzianko, Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, and others. Bezobrazov convinced Tsar Nicholas II of his plans, and the imperial cabinet approved the purchase over Witte’s objections in May 1898. To avoid complications with foreign powers, the concession was chartered as a private company in July 1901, and {{it was suggested that}} shares might be offered to Germany and France (although not to Japan or Great Britain). In the interim, the Boxer Rebellion had resulted in a tremendous increase in Russian military influence in the area, and Russia was able to obtain similar concessions from China on the Manchurian side of the Yalu River.|$|E
50|$|Due to Mount Molloy Ltd's new found {{interest}} in the timber industry, in December 1907 Anthony Linedale, one of {{the directors of the}} company, corresponded with the Director of Forests, Queensland Department of Public Lands, about the activities of Mount Molloy Ltd and its timber requirements. He noted that the company employed 173 men at the mine, 124 men at the smelters and refiners, 17 officers, 18 teamsters, 10 wood-getters, 19 men at the Biboohra railway yard and 320 men building the Molloy railway. That month the Director of Forests recommended that 10,000,000 superficial feet (1 super foot is a volume of timber representing 2360 cm3) be sold without competition to Mount Molloy Ltd, over 5 years, with a minimum removal of 30,000 super feet per month; the royalty to be a 25 per cent advance on the minimum royalties prescribed by the timber regulations for that district. The <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> covered 16,000 acres (6474.97 hectares) of Crown land north of Mount Molloy. On 6 March 1908 an agreement on the concession was made between Mount Molloy Ltd and Alexander Patrick Cameron, Land Commissioner for the district of Cairns, with royalties to be paid each month from June 1908. One condition, which Mount Molloy Ltd later regretted, was that all timber cut had to be sawn within Queensland. The inability to export logs later led to kauri logs being stockpiled at Mount Molloy.|$|E

In this context, the aim {{of this article is to}} examine the <b>timber</b> <b>concession</b> and licensing schemes in Mozambique, the main instruments governing logging operations, and to investigate behavioural differences between Chinese and non-Chinese commercial actors with regard to these instruments. Using available qualitative and quantitative data for Cabo Delgado province, the analysis reveals indica-tions for differences in the extent to which Chinese and non-Chinese timber operators manage to operate within the legal sphere despite incom-plete compliance with formal requirements. The observation suggests that Chinese actors could adapt positively to an environment in which laws were more effectively enforced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In 2006 Brazil passed {{legislation}} allowing <b>concessions</b> for industrial <b>timber</b> harvest in public forests. This decision {{was part of}} a broader effort to control deforestation, which had spiked to its second highest level, of about 25, 000 km 2, in 2004. Specifically, concessions were implemented as a means to control a rampaging timber industry while providing a source of accessible timber for sustainable harvest. <b>Timber</b> <b>concessions,</b> however, are not without their critics worldwide. Here we review the process undertaken to address international concerns over concessions in the policy design, we discuss the process of implementation in Brazil from 2007 to 2014 and then attempt to provide insight into the challenges that lie ahead. Our findings suggest that even though Brazil’s policy designers had the full knowledge of the difficulties with <b>timber</b> <b>concessions,</b> and attempted to design a concession framework to address those concerns, deeper structural problems within the industry and within government itself have prevented the successful scaling up of the concession model. Key hurdles include: government overlap and duplication causing unbearable transaction costs and risks to investors; an industry ill prepared and unwilling to adapt to the stringent requirements set in the policy; and little success in curtailing illegal logging beyond concession borders. While concessions remain a potentially important tool for the management of public forests, additional resources and time will need to be invested to overcome these barriers...|$|R
