In {{order to}} finance the company's {{continued}} expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced {{to follow through with}} the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring it.|$|E

The county bought shares worth 400,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Shares for a coastal railway were bought for NOK4.9 million, twice that of the interior route. The coastal route was expected to pay a dividend of three to four percent, compared to {{two and a half}} percent for the interior. Ahead of the county council meeting in December 1873 the county governor recommended that an application be sent to the government without a preferred route, but the majority of the county council's members voted in favor the interior alternative.|$|E

25|$|The VOC is {{generally}} considered to be the world's first truly transnational corporation and it was also the first multinational enterprise <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> of stock to the public. Some historians such as Timothy Brook and Russell Shorto consider the VOC as the pioneering corporation in the first wave of the corporate globalization era. The VOC was the first multinational corporation to operate officially in different continents such as Europe, Asia and Africa. While the VOC mainly operated in what later became the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and from other countries as well. Besides the diverse north-west European workforce recruited by the VOC in the Dutch Republic, the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or Eurasian workers might be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers. At the height of its existence the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route. Also, while most of its shareholders were Dutch, {{about a quarter of the}} initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and Luxembourg) and there were also a few dozen Germans.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E

2500|$|To {{give people}} shares {{initially}} there is formally a two step process. First, under CA 2006 section 558, shares must be [...] "allotted", or created {{in favour of}} a particular person. Second, shares are [...] "issued" [...] by being [...] "transferred" [...] to a person. In practice, because shares are not usually ‘bearer shares’ (i.e. the share is a physical piece of paper), the [...] "transfer" [...] simply means that the person’s name is entered on the register of members. Under CA 2006 sections 768 and 769, a certificate that evidences the share issue should be given by the company within two months. In a typical company constitution, directors are entitled <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> {{as part of their}} general management rights, although they have no power to do so outside the constitution. An authorisation must state the maximum number of allottable shares and the authority can only last for five years.|$|E

5000|$|The seminal {{authority}} {{in relation to}} {{what amounts to a}} proper purpose is the Privy Council decision of Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new shares. [...] It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. The court rejected an argument that the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> could only be properly exercised to raise new capital as too narrow, and held {{that it would be a}} proper exercise of the director's powers <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company. [...] If so, an incidental result (even desirable) that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.|$|E

30|$|The {{theory of}} {{hierarchical}} funding {{is based on}} two fundamental elements: the leader always seeks {{the interest of the}} existing shareholders, and the asymmetry of information. According to Myers (1984), the joint observation of these two principles follows the following assumptions: if the investors feel the value of the firm correctly, the leaders will refuse <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> new <b>shares</b> because some of the benefits of the investment project will be shared with the new shareholders. By contrast, if the investors overestimate the value of the firm, the leaders will then try <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> new shares; source of profit for the existing shareholders. Apart from the case of a recent and rapid growth of the firm, the new issuance of shares will then be seen as a negative signal by external investors. Therefore the price of the shares will tend to decrease during the announcement of their issuance. But, this <b>issue</b> of <b>shares</b> is regarded as a costly method of obtaining additional funds. Some firms would prefer not to even invest in a profitable project rather than <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> under-assessed <b>shares.</b>|$|R
