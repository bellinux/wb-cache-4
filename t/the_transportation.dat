40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a methodology for improving the performance of a port system by reallocating the demand for port services amongst the ports. To achieve this objective a mixed integer programming model that minimizes <b>the</b> total <b>transportation</b> cost is developed. <b>The</b> total <b>transportation</b> cost includes <b>the</b> maritime <b>transportation,</b> <b>the</b> marginal queueing, and <b>the</b> inland <b>transportation</b> costs. <b>The</b> solution of the model gives the optimum quantities of commodities that should be transferred through each port to meet the demand at each inland center. The model was applied to the Ecuadorian port system and it was found that reallocation of the service demand can reduce <b>the</b> total <b>transportation</b> cost by 27 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} {{study is to}} solve <b>the</b> {{multi-modal}} <b>transportation</b> routing planning problem that aims to select an optimal route to move a consignment of goods from its origin to its destination through <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> network. And <b>the</b> optimization is from two viewpoints including cost and time. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> routing planning problem. Minimizing <b>the</b> total <b>transportation</b> cost and <b>the</b> total <b>transportation</b> time are set as the optimization objectives of the model. In order to balance the benefit between the two objectives, Pareto optimality is utilized to solve the model by gaining its Pareto frontier. The Pareto frontier of the model can provide <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> operator (MTO) and customers with better decision support and it is gained by the normalized normal constraint method. Then, an experimental case study is designed to verify the feasibility of the model and Pareto optimality by using the mathematical programming software Lingo. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the demand and supply in <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> organization is performed based on the designed case. Findings: The calculation {{results indicate that the}} proposed model and Pareto optimality have good performance in dealing with the bi-objective optimization. The sensitivity analysis also shows the influence of the variation of the demand and supply on <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> organization clearly. Therefore, this method can be further promoted to the practice. Originality/value: A bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize <b>the</b> multi-modal <b>transportation</b> routing planning problem.
