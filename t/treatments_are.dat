5|$|Several {{clinical}} trials of new experimental <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> underway and planned in Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Medical <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} for Wilson's disease. Some increase {{the removal of}} copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
50|$|No {{curative}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{available for}} prolidase deficiency at this time, although palliative <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> possible to some extent.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> symptomatic, {{since the}} {{underlying}} genetic defect {{cannot be corrected}} as of 2015. Symptomatic <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> surgical.|$|R
30|$|Twelve <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by factorially combined six levels of N fertilizer (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100  kg N ha− 1) and two Rhizobium inoculation treatments (inoculated and uninoculated). The <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{laid out in}} randomized completely block design and all <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> replicated three times.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} is {{when the}} rate of dose delivery exceeds 12Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> performed on an outpatient basis, but this {{is dependent on the}} treatment site.|$|E
50|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} upon the underlying cause. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> supportive as {{it is not possible}} to induce regrowth of lost ducts.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> fire-safety education. At times, {{the best method}} of <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> child {{counseling}} or a residential treatment center.|$|R
50|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> usually {{supportive}} <b>treatment,</b> that <b>is,</b> <b>treatment</b> {{to reduce}} any symptoms {{rather than to}} cure the condition.|$|R
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> effective, {{especially}} in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|Palliative care is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
25|$|Neither a {{cure for}} SS nor a {{specific}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> known to permanently restore gland secretion. Instead, <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> generally symptomatic and supportive.|$|R
50|$|KTS is {{a complex}} syndrome, and no single <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{applicable}} for everyone. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> decided {{on a case-by-case basis}} with the individual's doctors.|$|R
30|$|To avoid cross infection, {{samples from}} the unchallenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} first. The challenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> collected after the unchallenged sample collection had been completed.|$|R
5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|<b>Treatments</b> <b>are</b> {{flexible}} enough {{to be used in}} hospitals, the patient's home, or increasingly by portable devices. Oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E
50|$|If {{binocular}} vision is present and head position <b>is</b> correct, <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> not obligatory. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> required for: visual symptoms, strabismus, or incorrect head position.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{defoliation}} <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{applied to}} Pima and upland cotton {{to compare the}} treatment effects on percent defoliation of the plants, percent first pick values, percent gin trash and any effects they might have on fiber qualities. All of the <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> beneficial compared to the untreated check, but differences between <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> small...|$|R
50|$|Initial <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{usually with}} oral {{prednisone}} (50-150 mg/day) or high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 3-7 days. Thyroid hormone <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> also included if required.|$|R
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. <b>Treatments</b> <b>are</b> available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
5|$|The primary aims {{of therapy}} are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications {{used in the}} management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> pursued by many people, despite {{the fact that there is}} little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.|$|E
40|$|Acupuncture <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} regarded as a relatively safe procedure. However, most procedures have some complications and acupuncture <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> no exception. Reported complications of acupuncture <b>treatment</b> <b>were</b> mostly mild or temporary symptoms, but certain severe adverse effects were also observed. We report {{here for the first}} time a case of liver abscess following acupuncture and moxibustion treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} endometriosis and {{strategies}} for its <b>treatment</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> mainly endocrine-based, using progestogens, danazol and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. Such <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> complex, and therapy strategies have to be tailored to the individual; the choice of treatment, therefore, depends on the metabolic and side-effects of each compound. Key words: endometriosis/medical therapy/symptomatolog...|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} step, by using DEA, the {{efficiency}} {{value of each}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> computed. Finally, the most efficient <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> determined using the maximin weight model approach.|$|R
5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds. These are unsightly, reduce the surface area of the plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce {{the value of the}} crop. These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> often necessary.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{introduction}} of anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibodies has improved the outcome of patients with follicular lymphoma, a curative <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> still not available. Many questions still remain to be answered: when should <b>treatment</b> <b>be</b> initiated? Is there an optimal first line treatment and can this <b>treatment</b> <b>be</b> individualized {{on the basis of}} prognostic markers? What <b>is</b> the best <b>treatment</b> strategy for relapsed follicular lymphoma and what is the place of the many novel agents? Should maintenance <b>treatment</b> <b>be</b> given to all patients and how? In the present review we will address these question...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the corrosion resistance of commercially pure titanium, anodizing surface <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> performed by modulating the cell voltage, which controls both {{the thickness of the}} oxide film and its morphology. Samples were tested with potentiodynamic tests in chlorides and fluorides containing solution {{in order to determine the}} pitting potential. Results showed that the anodizing <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> able to increase the resistance to corrosion, even if no <b>treatments</b> <b>was</b> able to offer the same corrosion resistance of palladium based titanium alloy. Based on the results, the best anodizing <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> selected...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{to prevent the}} {{progression}} of corneal damage and promote healing of the corneal epithelium. The <b>treatment</b> should always <b>be</b> personalized according to {{the severity of the}} disease. Conservative <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> typically the best option.|$|R
