5|$|Although sea otters can be {{playful and}} sociable, {{they are not}} {{considered}} to be truly social animals. <b>They</b> <b>spend</b> much time alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense.|$|E
5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where <b>they</b> <b>spend</b> {{most of their time}} in the upper canopy. By spending the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E
5|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} moult once a year, {{a process}} in which they replace all of their old feathers. <b>They</b> <b>spend</b> around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which <b>they</b> <b>spend</b> sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.|$|E

5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who <b>they</b> <b>spend</b> time with.|$|E

5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. <b>They</b> <b>spend</b> {{much of the}} day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E

5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, <b>they</b> <b>spend</b> most {{of their}} time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers {{are more likely to be}} found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

Robertson had briefly left the band in 1977 but subsequently returned. The group had planned {{to make a new}} studio album at the start of 1978. Working with producer Tony Visconti, Thin Lizzy retained commercial success with the album Bad Reputation, and the group wanted to work with him again.
