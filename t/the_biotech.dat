5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This marked the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>biotech</b> boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society.

His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E

2500|$|After Judge White's ruling, USDA-APHIS {{prepared}} {{an environmental}} assessment seeking partial deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets. The assessment was filed {{based on a}} request received from Monsanto and KWS SSAT AG, a German seed company. Both companies, {{as well as the}} sugar beet industry employees and growers, believed a sugar shortage would occur if glyphosate-resistant sugar beets could not be planted. [...] As a response to this concern, USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists, as well as those raised by the industry. [...] The first option was to not plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets until the EIS was completed. [...] The second option was to allow growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets if they obtained a USDA-APHIS permit and followed specific mandates. [...] Under the third and final option, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets would be partially deregulated, but monitored by Monsanto and KWS SSAT AG. [...] USDA-APHIS preferred the second option. [...] They placed the environmental assessment in the Federal Register on November 4, 2010, and received public comment for 30 days. [...] In November 2010, in response to a suit by the original parties, Judge White ordered the destruction of plantings of genetically modified sugar beets developed by Monsanto after ruling previously that the USDA had illegally approved <b>the</b> <b>biotech</b> crop.
