Analysis of questionnaire data revealed three major types of motive for attrition. Firstly, a strong socio-economic class influence was found. Women whose own and/or whose husbands' social class indicators were low tended to leave study because of a combination of lack of support from family for the mother's study, lack of money, weight of domestic responsibility and lack of knowledge or skills expected at university. Secondly, women who had been enrolled in non-traditional subjects (economics/business/law) were relatively over-represented amongst the discontinuing students and were particularly likely to cite lack of academic support or staff hostility as a <b>reason</b> for leaving. <b>Thirdly,</b> <b>reasons</b> for leaving study were found to be connected to student's age, suggesting a life style interpretation.

Understanding this process is not only important for physicians treating pediatric bone disorders, but also for clinicians and researchers dealing with postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis. Bone densitometry has great potential to enhance our understanding of bone development. The usefulness of densitometry in children and adolescents would be increased if the physiological mechanisms and structural features of bone were given more consideration in the design and interpretation of densitometric studies. This review gives an overview on the most relevant techniques of quantitative noninvasive bone analysis. Furthermore it describes the relationship between bone biology, selected surrogates describing the biological processes and the possibilities of measuring these surrogates specifically and precisely by the different devices. The overall recommendation for researchers in this field is to describe firstly the biological process to be analyzed (bone growth in length, remodeling or modeling, or all together), secondly the bone parameter which describes this process, and <b>thirdly</b> the <b>reason</b> for selecting a special device.

We use the second hypothesis of this model, that morality consists of practices of responsibility, to give an analysis of the understandings nurses had of their responsibilities in the euthanasia programs. The article starts with a brief introduction to the euthanasia programs of Nazi Germany from 1939 to 1945 and nurse participation, to illustrate how the responsibilities of nurses were manipulated. Secondly, nursing as moral practices are analysed {{in the context of the}} euthanasia programs that implement commonly shared understandings and practices of responsibility. <b>Thirdly,</b> the <b>reasons</b> that nurses gave for avoiding any responsibilities are examined.

All three Baltic States are Christian, {{but only}} Lithuania and Latvia {{have their own}} Catholic culture. Their ethnic {{religious}} heritage consists of sacral objects and folk devotion practices. There are many unique sacral sites that are visited by pilgrims {{from all over the}} world, such as the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai in Lithuania or Agluona shrine in Latvia. Long-standing personal practice has led to one of these phenomena becoming a research object – religious pilgrimage objects of Agluona and Vilnius region. The aim of the research is to reveal the relation of religious pilgrimage objects of Agluona and Vilnius region. Tasks of the research are: firstly, to present briefly aspects of historic origins of religious pilgrimage in Agluona and Vilnius region; secondly, to investigate reasons for relations between religious pilgrimage objects and devotional practices of Agluona and Vilnius region. Results of conducted research allow drawing these conclusions: firstly, historic origins of visiting sacral sites in Agluona and Vilnius region are identical, i. e. visiting of the painting Madonna with Child (both copy and original), completing little calvaries or 14 -station Way of the Cross, visiting of springs that have healing and grace giving features, celebration of Triduum of Pentecost and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Secondly, the origins of these relations lie in the culture of Dominican friars. <b>Thirdly,</b> <b>reasons</b> of the origins of sacred sites and their devotional practices in Agluona and Vilnius region are geopolitical. The conclusions validate the hypothesis and the proposition that religious pilgrimage objects in Agluona and Vilnius region (in Trakai) (painting Madonna with Child, the Way of the Cross of little calvaries or 14 -station Way of the Cross and one of its stations – the monument of Three Crosses (the hill), also sacred springs attended during Pentecost or the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) indicate relations of devotional practices and present the dialogue of international religious tourism.

We have carried out a qualitative research, based on an in-depth interview, on the opinions of 46 managers from a provincial area, the Mures County and from the top business area in Romania – Bucharest. We have reached three main conclusions. Firstly, the interviewees do not correlate the current problems of the Romanian society with active entrepreneurship; they do not find real solutions to these problems through entrepreneurial activities.

That he had neither the courage, nor the honesty, nor the piety, nor the humility that he dreamed he had? That a very little pain, for instance, putteth him out of patience, and as little pleasure softens and disarms him into ease and wantonness? That he has been at more pains, and labour, and cost, to be revenged of an enemy, than to oblige the best friend {{he has in the}} world? That he cannot bring himself to say his prayers, without a great deal of reluctancy; and when he does say them, the spirit and fervour of devotion evaporate in a very short time, and he can scarcely hold out a prayer of ten lines, without a number of idle and impertinent, if not vain and wicked thoughts coming into his head? These are very unwelcome discoveries that a man may make of himself; so that 'tis no wonder that every one who is already flushed with a good opinion of himself, should rather study how to run away from it, than how to converse with his own heart.|$|R

The study data shows that there are significant differences based on the reluctant/resistance paradigm. The reluctant group falls into those that want to use but have not wholly made up their minds to do so while the resistance groups are those that have no intention of using the internet banking system at all.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued by both lay people, church leaders and academic philosophers that evolutionary theory and especially the theory of common ancestry rules out any adequate notion of human dignity (I). In this paper, this claim is examined and refuted. First of all, when spelled out in a conceptually unambiguous way, {{it turns out that}} the evolutionary argument against human dignity hinges on the belief that human uniqueness, as this was traditionally encapsulated in the doctrine of the imago Dei, has been falsified (II). Secondly, therefore, a recent proposal to reinterpret this doctrine in a way which allows us to drop the notion of human uniqueness but to still uphold a robust notion of human dignity is discussed (III). It is concluded, however, that this proposal is problematic for several <b>reasons.</b> <b>Thirdly,</b> therefore, a more fruitful avenue is explored, namely the attempt to reinterpret the notions of human uniqueness and human dignity along theological rather than biological lines (IV). It will turn out that this attempt, which is inspired by both contemporary biblical scholarship and systematic theology, in fact enables us to adhere to notions of human uniqueness and human dignity (and to connect this to the doctrine of the imago Dei) which are not at odds with evolutionary theory.

The empirical findings of this study support the following. Firstly, the existing style of supervision of secondary schools in Sindh, applied through traditional inspection of schools, is defective and outdated. Secondly, the behaviour of {{the educational}} supervisor tends to be too rigid and autocratic. <b>Thirdly,</b> the <b>reasons</b> for the resistance of existing system of supervision to change along the lines and policies formulated in recent years are to be found outside the education system and not merely within the education system or within the supervisory sub-system. The thesis is organised as follows. First chapter looks into the background of the problem and analyses the failure in the existing supervisory system of secondary school education within Pakistan in general and the province of Sindh in particular. Second chapter describes the historical perspectives and development of education in Pakistan with special reference to province of Sindh. Third chapter elaborates the contextual analysis of the problem and focuses on issues of modernization, bureaucracy and participation in Pakistan.

To {{analyze the}} impact of six job {{characteristics}} on the intention of nurses to leave their organization, specifically focusing on long term care settings: nursing homes, care homes and home care. Background. When nurses leave their organization, this can negatively affect organizational performance. Organizations have to recruit new nurses and tacit knowledge is lost. Furthermore, organizational turnover could contribute to the nursing shortage, which will increasingly become a problem given the aging population. This article adds to the literature, given a) its focus on long term care and b) by explicating the differences between nursing and care homes (intramural) {{on the one hand}} and home care (extramural) on the other. Design. Survey Method. Survey of 9, 982 nurses in 156 Dutch organizations in 2010 - 2011, 6, 321 nurses in nursing and care homes and 3, 661 nurses working in home care, based on the ActiZ Benchmark in Healthcare. Results.

The impact of the working atmosphere is not often examined in the literature. However, this research shows that it is an important <b>reason.</b> <b>Thirdly,</b> intention to leave is partly context dependent. More specifically, when nurses in home care felt that their autonomy was reduced, this strongly influenced their intention to leave, while this was not the case for nurses working in nursing and care homes.

40|$|This report {{examines}} insecure work in NZ {{from four}} perspectives. It is {{a collaborative effort}} to increase {{our understanding of the}} insecure work landscape in NZ by utilising two waves of the Survey of Working Life (2008 and 2012). While we acknowledge that the perception of job insecurity and precarity in general could also apply to permanent workers, data availability means we restrict our forthcoming analysis to often equating insecure work to temporary employment. Over the last two decades, insecure work has gained increasing currency in the OECD countries. There are many reasons for this. This includes free choice whereby workers choose temporary work due to its preferable characteristics, such as flexibility, shorter hours, based on childcare arrangements, etc. Apart from free choice there are often three drivers identified in terms of rising levels of ‘non-standard’ work. First, globalisation has forced a greater worldwide division of labour, more volatile international market conditions, and employers forced to become more flexible in a bid to remain competitive. Second, demographic forces have resulted in rising female labour force participation rates and a growing motivation for new working arrangements that are compatible with childcare responsibility. <b>Thirdly,</b> cyclical <b>reasons</b> – policy makers often bid for greater labour market flexibility when unemployment is high. NZ is an interesting case study for more research on temporary employment. According to the ‘OECD indicators on employment protection legislation’, NZ has the third lowest level of protective regulation for temporary workers, with a score of 0. 92 compared to an OECD average of 2. 07 (with 0 equating to least restrictions and a score of 6 indicating most restrictions). Nevertheless, empirical research on the experiences of insecure workers and the links that can be established with their employment conditions remains negligible in NZ. Thus, a group of researchers from three universities in NZ was supported by Industrial Relations Fund (MBIE) to attempt to address this research gap. This report presents a range of perspectives and latest research on insecure work. A variety of angles are explored – from investigating the existence of an unexplained wage gap between temporary and permanent workers; to better understanding the contributing factors towards precarity (in a bid towards constructing an index of job precarity); to assessing the association between precarious employment and employer-provided training; and then finally to understanding {{the nature of the relationship}} between job insecurity and satisfaction at work. The data mainly came from the 2008 and 2012 Survey of Working Life, which represents a rich source of information on the employment conditions, working arrangements, and job quality of employed New Zealanders...|$|R

Secondly finding out how long teachers take to report in work stations. <b>Thirdly</b> to investigate <b>reasons</b> given by teachers for late reporting and not staying long in the work stations after reporting. Fourthly determination of time for teachers staying before quitting their first station. A survey research design was used. The researcher used quantitative descriptive statistics. The sample of this study included six public secondary schools, 173 teachers, 6 heads of schools and 6 academic officers, 6 ward education officers, 1 District Secondary Education Officer, 1 Teachers Service Department (TSD) officer and 1 Teachers Workers Union (CWT). Non probability sampling was used for selecting the sample. Purposive sampling techniques were used to get respondents. Teachers available on material day responded to questionnaires. Data were obtained through structured interview guides and various district educational records. The study shows that, there was an acute shortage of science subject teachers in the district, also there was a delay of teachers reporting in their work stations. The leading reason for teachers’ late reporting involved lack of interest in geographical location while the reason for teachers not staying long after reporting in their work stations was poor working conditions which together contribute to teachers’ deficit and students’ poor performance. It was recommended that government should create conducive and attractive working environment which could attract the qualified candidates to report and stay long in their working stations...|$|R

Firstly, they can’t detect vehicles’ trajectory {{information that is}} necessary for building origin-destination (OD) matrix in traffic planning. Secondly, {{it is impossible to}} cover the whole road network with them with respect to economic <b>reasons.</b> <b>Thirdly,</b> their applicability and reliability are limited by design and external factors such as weather conditions. In view of these defects, a new approach that employs vehicles as mobile sensors to collect their trajectory data for traffic study is introduced. The recent development of positioning and communication technologies makes it possible to collect, transfer, and apply large trajectory data from moving vehicles, and as a result, a large number of trajectory data have been or will be available, which pushes the development of the mentioned approach. Although so, during the implementation of this approach, three kinds of challenges emerge in trajectory data collection, management, and application, respectively. This paper focuses on the solution to model trajectory data which is a part of trajectory data management. Large data volume and frequent data transfer and update are two major problems in modeling trajectory data. Existing approaches have made some efforts to resolve these problems partly. However, they failed to build the relationship between trajectory and underlying road network which is necessary in evaluating network-related queries. In view of it, we developed a LRS (Linear Referencing System) -based trajectory data model that (1) directly includes the above relationship in trajectory data representation, (2) further reduces data volume and frequency of data transfer and update, and (3) facilitates the construction of index for accessing trajectory data in network-related queries. A performance study depicts that the proposed model outperforms existing ones...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the aspirations}} and {{achievements of the}} lay women who were active in the campaign to improve women's health, and of those women who sought entry into paid occupations in the health services. After an introduction, Section One is intended to place the substantive data in context. Middle-class women's enthusiasm for voluntary work and the terms on which women entered national politics are discussed. These issues are used to illustrate the effects the maintenance of rigid social-class divisions had on {{the unity of the}} women's movement and the implications {{for the future of the}} movement of the decision to seek entry to the public domain on the grounds that women could make a unique contribution. Section Two is devoted to the lay women. First, the effect of the maintenance of rigid social-class divisions on the women's health campaign and on women seeking a career in the health services is discussed. Secondly, the consensus between both middle-class and working-class women, the medical profession and the Ministry of Health on the need to extend medical services is analysed, revealing an eagerness to follow technical advice which affected the strategy of the lay campaign and meant support for women workers in the health services was often circumspect. <b>Thirdly,</b> the <b>reasons</b> for the collapse of this consensus in the l 93 Os are discussed. This section is concluded with an assessment of the lay women's health campaign and a discussion of the impact the campaign had on women health workers. In Section Three, women's position as paid employees in the health services is analysed, and three occupations, midwifery, medicine and health visiting, have been selected. Difficulties these women encountered establishing themselves in paid employment, and their status and their relations with male colleagues and with the Ministry of Health are assessed. The differences between these three occupations, which prevented a sense of solidarity and an identification with the goals of the women's movement, are discussed. Their achievements during the period are assessed, and the effects of the medicalisation of childbirth and the increasing involvement of the state in maternity and child welfare are investigated. A fourth, concluding section draws these strands together. The lay women's health campaign and the goals and tactics of the women health workers are related to the maintenance of the existing social-class divisions, the ideological splits within the women's movennt and the persistence of barriers preventing women from competing on equal terms with men in the public domain. Although the number of women working in the health services increased dramatically and women's place in these services was assured, women generally remained in subordinate positions, excluded from the prestigious and lucrative posts, while they achieved only a statutory presence on decision-making bodies...|$|R

The ideal rhetor in the {{new public}} sphere of the 18 th century) In this essay Swedish {{cultures}} of politeness during {{the other half of}} the eighteenth century are explored with focus on rhetoric and gender. The dethronement of classical rhetoric in the eighteenth century has been associated with the formation of the public sphere and the communicative needs of the rising middle class. Cultures of politeness were crucial for this process. The point of departure in the essay is the ideological tension between classical civic rhetoric on the one hand and cultures of politeness on the other. The latter are found to be associated with ideals of femininity, and thus gendered in contrast to a classical rhetoric tradition. Materials are fetched from Sweden’s most influential learned societies: Tankebyggarorden, Utile Dulci, Apollini Sacra, Sällskapet Aurora, and Göteborgs Vetenskaps- och Vitterhets-Samhälle. The questions at hand are: Who were considered a suitable rhetor in the societies? What was seen as ideal eloquence and rhetoric? Analyses of speeches demonstrate how notions on ideal eloquence are intertwined with conceptions on national splendour and gender. The ideal rhetor combines naturalness and candid manliness with sensibility and the ability to tender friendship with other men. The rhetoric he uses harmonises with these characteristics. Elderly ideals of classical rhetoric are rejected, but yet sometimes used in practice. Only 26 women were accepted as members in the societies under discussion. Three main reasons for their participation are identified. Firstly social grounds: women in early modern Sweden from the higher social strata were expected to appear in public. Secondly women were elected for patriotic <b>reasons.</b> <b>Thirdly</b> certain female qualities (sociability and sensibility) where seen as essential for the societies. Despite an originally positive attitude towards qualities being branded as feminine, women were gradually being marginalised and towards the end of the century the male rhetor alone occupies this public scene as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} a number of {{questions}} that are highly important for the ex ante evaluation of the safety impacts of transport policy options, from the perspective of ethical theory: (1) Is it morally OK to express prevention on acceptance of fatalities or risks in monetary terms? (2) How useful is the concept of the value of a statistical life (VOSL) for ex ante evaluations of transport policy options? (3) What are {{the pros and cons of}} pricing protection of lives or prevention of risks in ex ante evaluations? (4) Which methods are available for expressing (protection of) human lives in monetary terms, and what are the main related methodological discussions? (5) Are all safety-related costs generally included in ex ante evaluations of the safety impacts of transport policy options, and if not: what is the relevance of excluded costs categories from an ethical perspective? (6) How important is the distribution of safety effects from an ethical perspective? The answer to the first question highly depends on the ethical theory that is used. With respect to question 2 we think that the VOSL is a useful concept, but that its application is not straightforward, for several <b>reasons.</b> <b>Thirdly</b> we think that probably pricing safety improves the quality of decision making, but to the best of our knowledge there is no research to underpin this expectation. The answer to question 4 is that several methods exist to estimate the value of a statistical life (VOSL), willingness-to-pay (WTP) methods being the most common category of methods. However, several methodological issues arise that make estimates of VOSL less straightforward. With respect to question 5 we conclude that behaviour-related avoidance costs are often overlooked and that these costs are relevant from an ethical perspective because the freedom to move and the freedom to participate in activities are challenged. Finally the answer to question 6 is that from an ethical perspective, in terms of the evaluation of policy measures, it might matter which groups of the population are the victims of the transport system, or are at risk. Egalitarian theories as well as sufficientarianism are useful theories to discuss distribution effects. Different theories conclude differently. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{understand}} what energy resources mean for the long term sustainable development in rural areas, {{to understand}} how to improve people’s life quality and mitigate environmental impacts. This study aims at discussing the problems and the sustainability of the energy system in one rural settlement in the southern Rwanda, called Ngera. The settlement is one of the villages that were built after the genocide in 1994 to manage and resettle the returnees. Through interviews, observations, participatory exercises and quantitative measurements, a description of the energy resources and energy system was achieved, and the processes biomass production, collection, combustion and energy services were understood and analysed. Woody biomass is the main energy resource in Rwanda. For domestic use it serves as energy for food preparation, water heating, space heating, lighting and clothes washing. There is no electricity in the village and the inhabitants mostly collect and use trees and tree litter from nearby public forests and tree plots. The biomass of the woody plants in the forest where most of the villagers fetch fuel is 50 - 300 t/ha, depending on how dense the trees grow. The villagers spend in average one hour in the forest every day to collect and transport fuelwood to their homes. Through combustion of the fuelwood in a traditional Kinyarwanda three-stones stove or a fuel-economic stove called rondereza, the villagers get energy. After combusting the fuel the ash is put on arable plots to serve as fertilizer. Other energy carriers that the villagers use are non-woody biomass, fossil fuels like kerosene and diesel, as well as galvanic batteries and solar cells. They are used to get light or to use equipment such as radios and watches. The Kinyarwanda stove is the most common in the village and has an efficiency of 16 - 21 %. Although the rondereza is well promoted by the government there are only two households in the settlement that have invested in it. There are some possible reasons for that; firstly, traditions keep people to what they are accustomed to, and secondly, {{there is a lack of}} both skills and monetary means. <b>Thirdly,</b> there are <b>reasons</b> such as lack of information, since the settlement is segregated from other villages, and participation in the training and education is scarce. Education is often dictated by men for men, and since men are not using the stove they are not keen on replacing stoves. Fourthly, Rwandan traditions say that one should not talk about family matters outside the family and therefore the knowledge is spread slowly. The organic law, implemented in 2005, aims at protecting the environment. It forbids people to cut or harm trees. The law has led to an increase in labour input for the inhabitants to find fuel. Even though it is a good initiative in the long run, it affects and worsens especially the women’s situation in Rwanda. They have to spend more time away from home, less time on their children, education and income work...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} the study was {{directed}} toward improvement of administration of public school custodial programs. The study was designed to: (1) provide Indiana custodial administrators with an overview of perceptions of Indiana custodial administrators generally regarding use and soundness of selected custodial management practices; (2) provide information that would be beneficial in developing or revising custodial program policies and administrative procedures; (3) provide information about custodial management practices employed in school corporations of comparable size; (4) provide information concerning the impact of employee union affiliation on the use and soundness of custodial management practices; and (5) provide institutions which prepare administrative personnel with information regarding current custodial management practices. The literature was reviewed concerning the management functions of planning, organizing, controlling, coordinating, directing, staffing, and evaluating. Literature was also reviewed concerning custodial management practices and then integrated under appropriate management functions. A list of selected custodial management practices was developed, validated, modified, and finally placed in questionnaire format. The questionnaire was distributed to sixty-selected Indiana school corporations categorized as large, medium, and small. Respondents reported use, non-use, or questioned use to each of eighty-five practices. Secondly, respondents reported each practice to be sound, unsound, or of questioned soundness. <b>Thirdly,</b> respondents reported <b>reasons</b> for non-use of practices judged to be sound but not used. Major conclusions drawn from the study included: 1. Broad usage of custodial management practices described in the questionnaire was observed. 2. Over 75 per cent of the selected custodial management practices were judged to be sound by school administrators. 3. There was a strong relationship between size of school districts and the degree to which custodial management practices were used. 4. There was a strong relationship between size of school districts and the degree to which custodial management practices were judged to be sound. 5. Large school districts used more selected practices and judged more practices to be sound than medium and small school districts. 6. Lack of time to implement practices was the reason reported most often for practices not used but judged to be sound. 7. There was a significant relationship between union affiliation and use and soundness of selected custodial management practices. Several implications were suggested: 1. Careful assignment of time priorities can improve the managerial process related to custodial programs. 2. Small and medium school districts might improve custodial programs by adopting practices used by large school districts. 3. Efficiency of custodial programs might be increased by utilizing cost control measures. 4. Institutions that prepare administrators might improve long-range administration of custodial programs by devoting instructional efforts to management theory, organizational behavior, and business management functions. Several recommendations were made: 1. Appropriate state agencies should provide leadership in procuring and disseminating information concerning the need for providing efficiency in operation of custodial programs. 2. Appropriate state agencies should provide leadership in developing methods, techniques, and procedures to facilitate the improvement of custodialprograms. 3. College and university professors of educational administration should provide leadership in designing programs aimed at preparing administrators who can dealeffectively and efficiently with management of custodial programs. 4. The inquiry instrument should be refined and improved for use in further research at local, state, and national levels to enhance the improvement of the administration of custodial programs in educational institutions.
