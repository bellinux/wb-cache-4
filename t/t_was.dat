5|$|The fifth {{match was}} Booker T's {{defense of the}} TNA Legends Championship against Christian Cage, with the added {{stipulation}} that if Cage lost, he {{would be forced to}} join The Main Event Mafia. Booker <b>T</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by Sharmell for the bout. The match lasted for 11 minutes, ending when Booker T pinned Cage with a roll-up.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Sting {{defeated}} the challenger A.J. Styles. Kevin Nash versus Samoa Joe was also featured on the card. Nash defeated Joe in the contest. A Falls Count Anywhere match pitting Kurt Angle against Abyss was promoted for the undercard, which Angle won. The TNA Legends Championship was defended {{for the first time}} by Booker T against Christian Cage during the show. Booker <b>T</b> <b>was</b> the victor in the bout, thus retaining the championship.|$|E
5000|$|In general, if <b>T</b> <b>is</b> densely {{defined and}} {{symmetric}}, {{the domain of}} the adjoint T∗ need not equal the domain of <b>T.</b> If <b>T</b> <b>is</b> symmetric and the domain of T and {{the domain of the}} adjoint coincide, then we say that <b>T</b> <b>is</b> self-adjoint. [...] Note that, when <b>T</b> <b>is</b> self-adjoint, the existence of the adjoint implies that <b>T</b> <b>is</b> densely defined and since T∗ <b>is</b> necessarily closed, <b>T</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|R

5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The <b>T</b> <b>was</b> oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker <b>T</b> <b>was</b> the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker <b>T</b> <b>was</b> released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
5|$|The match Kaz and Booker T versus Christian Cage and Robert Roode {{was also}} scheduled. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Booker T, {{along with his}} real-life wife Sharmell, made their Impact! debut signing talent contracts. They were {{interrupted}} by Cage, sparking a rivalry between Booker T and Cage. On the November 29 episode of Impact!, Cage manipulated Roode into thinking that Booker <b>T</b> <b>was</b> trying to steal his spot at becoming a main star in the promotion. Roode went on to fight Booker T later in the episode in a losing effort. After the encounter, Cage and Roode attacked Booker T, which led Kaz {{to come to his}} aid in the situation. A tag team match between the four was later promoted by TNA for Turning Point.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model <b>T</b> <b>was</b> introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model <b>T</b> <b>was</b> the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted {{to start all over again}} with the letter A.|$|E
