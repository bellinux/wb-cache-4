Employing an account of empirical philosophy, the article links self-conducted empirical research with philosophical ideas.

Rather, they appear as highly fragile mediations of heterogeneous elements {{that make up the}} <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>spaces</b> of emerging in/dependences and dis/abilities.

5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller amount of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with}} the same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
