25|$|At first, the Giants <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{ahead and}} recover. They vowed {{to win their}} {{remaining}} four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3–9 Buffalo Bills late in the game, giving up 27 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to lose 41–17. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6–10 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans.|$|E
25|$|The Ross Sea {{party was}} a {{component}} of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice {{between them and the}} relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} {{analysis}} of the scientific revolution during this period, there has been criticism of not only the Eurocentric ideologies spread, {{but also of the}} dominance of male scientists of the time. Science as we know it today, and the original theories that we base modern science on, was built by males, regardless of the input women might have made. The incorporation of women's work in the sciences during this time tends to be obscured. Scholars have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the participation of women in the 17th century in science, and even with sciences as simple as domestic knowledge women were making advances. With the limited history provided from texts of the period we are not completely aware if women were helping these scientists develop the ideas they did. Another idea to consider is the way this period influenced even the women scientists of the periods following it. Annie Jump Cannon was an astronomer who benefitted from the laws and theories developed from this period; she made several advances in the century following the scientific revolution. It was an important period for the future of science, including the incorporation of women into fields using the developments made.|$|E

In January 2013, The Onions A.V. Club {{compiled a list}} of such overlooked dump months films. It includes many that have since become cult classics, like the 1991 Kevin Bacon horror film Tremors, 1999's Office Space and 2000's Boiler Room, all released in late February. They also recommend the January 1993 release Matinee, starring John Goodman as legendary gimmick-using film producer William Castle, and The Pledge, a January 2001 film starring Jack Nicholson.

500|$|In July 1980, Bill Lyon of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{wrote that}} many fans unfairly stereotyped McBride as a lazy player {{because of his}} bad knees and his low-key personality.

Lyon wrote that because McBride did not talk about his injuries a lot to the public, most people did not realize that his knee joint had significantly eroded and that he was [...] "essentially, a one-legged player." [...] Lyon said that McBride's Afro hairstyle and his isolated nature furthered the stereotypes that many fans held. McBride said that he had never been a man who showed much emotion, and {{he thought it would be}} hypocritical if he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more intense just to appease the fans.|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 {{article for}} PopMatters, music writer Tyler Lewis said that neo soul has been {{received}} with much controversy: [...] "Given the way black {{music has been}} named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, {{the reaction to the}} name by artists who ostensibly fit into the 'neo-soul' category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination in an industry that is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks." [...] Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of [...] "new wave" [...] and comments: [...] "As imperfect as the term may be, neo-soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time-honoured tradition that distinguished the genre's best examples. Neo-soul artists <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> both backward and forward, acting in the belief that a continuum might exist." ...|$|E

Later on the stages, Avex executives threatened to fire Koda if no improvements were put into place, which she eventually did but wasn't notified until her single [...] "Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba". In mid 2000, Kumi was asked by Avex to make her promotional debut through a photo shoot with photographer Toku, {{which led to the}} shooting of the cover sleeve for [...] "Take Back".

500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in Plenty, believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Herseni diversified his contribution, with {{a chapter in}} the {{pastoralist}} sociology treatise of Franz Ronneberger and Gerhardt Teich (1971) and an essay introducing the work of psychologist Nicolae Vaschide (1975). Other tracts were focused on defining and applying theories from the sociology of literature to a Romanian context. At Editura Univers, he published Sociologia literaturii. Cîteva puncte de reper ("Literary Sociology. A Few Pointers", 1973), and Literatură și civilizație ("Literature and Civilization", 1976). As noted in 2008 by scholar Eugen Negrici, these works are intertwined with the official dogmas of national communism: [...] "still haunted by his old fears, [...] <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> his best {{in front of the}} communist authorities, providing his sociological perspective—one saturated with Marxist cliches—on Romanian literature".|$|E

According to Halliwell, Nannerl depended on Leopold in many ways: he did [...] "shopping [...] the engagement of servants. ... He relayed news from Salzburg, Munich, and Vienna to divert her, did his best to organize the maintenance of her fortepiano, paid for Wolfgang's music to be copied and arranged for her to receive it; collected musicians together when she had visited him so that she could play it with most of the parts; [...]. <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her health; and encouraged her to stand up to her husband when he was being unreasonable."

2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality.

He flabbergasted Gromyko by telling {{him that he was}} willing to sacrifice the lives of [...] "300 million people" [...] just for the sake of annexing the Republic of China into the People's Republic of China. Gromyko assured Mao that the proposal would never get the approval of the Soviet leadership. When the Soviet leadership learnt of this discussion they responded by terminating the Soviet-Chinese nuclear program and various industrialization projects in the People's Republic of China. Years later Gromyko, during the Cuban Missile Crisis under Nikita Khrushchev, acting on the instruction of the Soviet leadership met John F. Kennedy, then President of the United States. Gromyko wrote in his Memoirs that Kennedy seemed out of touch when he first met him, he further claimed that Kennedy was not practical but instead very ideologically driven. Gromyko, in an interview in 1988, described Kennedy as nervous and said most of his arguments were contradictory. Threats towards Cuba were followed by assertions by the United States government that they were not planning any assaults on Cuba. During his twenty-eight years as Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko supported the policy of disarmament, stating in his Memoirs that [...] "Disarmament is the ideal of Socialism".|$|E
