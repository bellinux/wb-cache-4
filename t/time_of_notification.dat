40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability of notifications in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator of acceptability of notifications in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect of physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling of notifications in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability of notifications in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|E

The sexual disorders that were reported most frequently were reduced libido, erectile dysfunction and delayed orgasm. It seems likely that these disorders were caused not only by pharmacological effects of ssris but also by psychological factors.

40|$|Background: Acute flaccid {{paralysis}} (AFP) {{is the most}} common clinical presentation of acute poliovirus infection, occurring in 0. 1 - 1 % of infected cases. AFP surveillance has been used world-wide to monitor the control and eradication of circulating wild poliovirus. This study aims to review the significance of all enteroviruses, including polioviruses, isolated from patients with AFP in Australia between 1996 and 2004. Methods: We undertook a retrospective review of all notified cases of AFP, aged 0 - 15 years and resident in Australia at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> We reviewed all available clinical and virological data for these cases and all records of the Polio Expert Committee, which determined the final classification for all cases. Results: There were 335 notified cases that satisfied the case definition for AFP, 162 (48 %) of whom had at least one faecal sample tested. Enteroviruses isolated from the faeces of 26 (16 %) of the 162 cases were Coxsackie A 24, Coxsackie B 5, enterovirus 71, enterovirus 75, echovirus 9, echovirus 11 and echovirus 18. In addition, one or more polioviruses were isolated from the faeces of seven patients. Six of seven polioviruses were characterised as Sabin-like, one was not characterised, but all were considered to be incidental isolates. Five of these cases were classified as infant botulism, one case as transverse myelitis and one as a focal mononeuropathy. Conclusion: With the eradication of circulating wild polioviruses, other enteroviruses are being more commonly identified as the cause of polio-like illnesses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{countries}} are implementing measles elimination strategies. In Australia, the State of Victoria has conducted enhanced measles surveillance since 1997 using case interviews and home-based specimen collection for laboratory confirmation. We attempted to identify features of notified cases that would better target surveillance resources. METHODS: We retrospectively classified notifications received from 1998 to 2003 {{as having been}} received in an epidemic (one or more laboratory-confirmed cases) or an interepidemic period (no laboratory-confirmed cases). We labelled the first case notified in any epidemic period that was not laboratory-confirmed at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> as a "sentinel case". To maximize detection of sentinel cases while minimizing the follow-up of eventually discarded notifications, we generated algorithms using sentinel cases and interepidemic notifications. FINDINGS: We identified 10 sentinel cases with 422 interepidemic notifications from 1281 Victorian notifications. Sentinel cases {{were more likely to}} report fever at rash onset (odds ratio (OR) 15. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) CI: 2. 1 - 688. 9), cough (OR 10. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 456. 7), conjunctivitis (OR 7. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 39. 1), or year of birth between 1968 and 1981 (OR 31. 8, 95 % CI: 6. 7 - 162. 3). Prospective application of an algorithm consisting of fever at rash onset or born between 1968 and 1981 in the review period would have detected all sentinel cases and avoided the need for enhanced follow-up of 162 of the 422 eventually discarded notifications. CONCLUSION: Elimination strategies should be refined to suit regional and local priorities. The prospective application of an algorithm in Victoria is likely to reduce enhanced measles surveillance resource use in interepidemic periods, while still detecting early cases during measles outbreaks...|$|E

METHODS This is a cross-sectional study of cases of tuberculosis tested for first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin) in Espírito Santo between 2002 and 2012. We have used laboratory data and registration of cases of tuberculosis – from the Sistema Nacional de Agravos de Notificação and Sistema para Tratamentos Especiais de Tuberculose. Individuals have been classified as resistant and non-resistant and compared {{in relation to the}} sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables. Some variables have been included in a logistic regression model to establish the factors associated with resistance. RESULTS In the study period, 1, 669 individuals underwent anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Of these individuals, 10. 6 % showed resistance to any anti-tuberculosis drug. The rate of multidrug resistance observed, that is, to rifampicin and isoniazid, has been 5 %. After multiple analysis, we have identified as independent factors associated with resistant tuberculosis: history of previous treatment of tuberculosis [recurrence (OR = 7. 72; 95 %CI 4. 24 – 14. 05) and re-entry after abandonment (OR = 3. 91; 95 %CI 1. 81 – 8. 43) ], smoking (OR = 3. 93; 95 %CI 1. 98 – 7. 79), and positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of the case (OR = 3. 22; 95 %CI 1. 15 – 8. 99).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two of {{the major}} risk factors for {{hepatitis}} C are injection drug use and receipt of blood or blood products. Many patients are unaware that they have received transfusions. In 1998 Prince Edward Island conducted a province-wide look-back notification program to notify patients who had received transfusions in PEI between Jan. 1, 1984, and June 1, 1990. The authors present {{the results of the}} notification program. METHODS: A registry for recipients of blood and blood products was created from the province's Red Cross blood bank records. The registry data were linked with Vital Statistics data to determine death status and with Health Registration data to determine residence status of recipients (in PEI or moved out of province). All identified recipients with a current PEI mailing address were sent a letter recommending hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing. Laboratory records were checked to determine HCV test results. RESULTS: The registry contained data for 6086 recipients of blood or blood products during the look-back period; 51. 1 % (3109 / 6086) had died by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> Of the remainder, 18. 4 % (549 / 2977) were not directly notified because they had moved out of province, had refused delivery of the notification letter or had died recently, or because identifying information was missing from the blood bank records. Of the recipients who were notified 80. 4 % (1953 / 2428) underwent testing, and 2. 2 % (43 / 1953) were found to be HCV positive. Most of these (58. 1 % [25 / 43]) had undergone testing before notification. The HCV positivity rate differed significantly between recipients tested before notification and those tested after notification (9. 9 % v. 1. 1 %, p < 0. 001). HCV-positive recipients were more likely than other notified recipients to have had multiple transfusions (39. 5 % v. 9. 5 %, p < 0. 001).

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{changes in}} psychological and immunological functioning during 5 -week periods preceding and following notification of serostatus among gay males taking the HIV- 1 antibody test. Forty-six asymptomatic homosexual men {{between the ages}} of 18 and 40 yrs were recruited from a gay men 2 ̆ 7 s organization and through advertisements in a local newspaper. Measures of cell-mediated immunity (lymphocyte phenotypic markers, mitogen responsivity, and natural killer cell cytotoxicity) and psychological functioning (state anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and avoidant behaviors) were obtained at baseline, five weeks later and 72 hr before serostatus notification, and 1 week, 3 weeks and 5 weeks postnotification. Results suggested a dissociation between psychological and immunological phenomena among seropositives wherein lymphocyte proliferative responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) remained unchanged in the face of significant increases in state anxiety and intrusive thoughts following serostatus notification. These findings suggested that asymptomatic HIV- 1 infected individuals, even at the earliest stages of infection, may be unable to mount an immune response to potent psychosocial stressors (i. e., serostatus notification), due perhaps, {{to the fact that the}} viral contribution to immune functioning overrides any influence of environmental stimuli. Among the seronegative subjects studied, blastogenic responses to PHA and PWM were depressed at baseline (relative to a group of age and gender-matched controls who were not undergoing HIV- 1 antibody testing) but PHA values returned to normal values 5 weeks later. Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and CD 4 +CD 45 R+ inducer cell counts appeared to parallel these changes in seronegatives. Seropositives did display fluctuations in NK cell cytotoxicity that were similar to those noted for seronegatives. Correlational analyses suggested that individual differences in anxiety responses at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of seropositivity predicted subsequent (1 -week lag) declines in NK cell cytotoxicity but not other functional markers. Although most seropositives displayed clinical levels of anxiety, intrusive thoughts and avoidant responses during the week of serostatus notification, these measures returned to their initial nonclinical baseline levels within 5 weeks after notification in both the seropositive and seronegative groups...|$|E
40|$|Can {{the early}} {{identification}} of the species of staphylococcus responsible for infection {{by the use of}} Real Time PCR technology influence the approach to the treatment of these infections? ^ This study was a retrospective cohort study in which two groups of patients were compared. The first group, ‘Physician Aware’ consisted of patients in whom physicians were informed of specific staphylococcal species and antibiotic sensitivity (using RT-PCR) at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of the gram stain. The second group, ‘Physician Unaware’ consisted of patients in whom treating physicians received the same information 24 – 72 hours later as a result of blood culture and antibiotic sensitivity determination. ^ The approach to treatment was compared between ‘Physician Aware’ and ‘Physician Unaware’ groups for three different microbiological diagnoses—namely MRSA, MSSA and no-SA (or coagulase negative Staphylococcus). ^ For a diagnosis of MRSA, the mean time interval to the initiation of Vancomycin therapy was 1. 08 hours in the ‘Physician Aware’ group as compared to 5. 84 hours in the ‘Physician Unaware’ group (p= 0. 34). ^ For a diagnosis of MSSA, the mean time interval to the initiation of specific anti-MSSA therapy with Nafcillin was 5. 18 hours in the ‘Physician Aware’ group as compared to 49. 8 hours in the ‘Physician Unaware’ group (p= 0. 007). Also, for the same diagnosis, the mean duration of empiric therapy in the ‘Physician Aware’ group was 19. 68 hours as compared to 80. 75 hours in the ‘Physician Unaware’ group (p= 0. 003) ^ For a diagnosis of no-SA or coagulase negative staphylococcus, the mean duration of empiric therapy was 35. 65 hours in the ‘Physician Aware’ group as compared to 44. 38 hours in the ‘Physician Unaware’ group (p= 0. 07). However, when treatment was considered a categorical variable and after exclusion of all cases where anti-MRS therapy was used for unrelated conditions, only 20 of 72 cases in the ‘Physician Aware’ group received treatment as compared to 48 of 106 cases in the ‘Physician Unaware’ group. ^ Conclusions. Earlier diagnosis of MRSA may not alter final treatment outcomes. However, earlier identification may lead to the earlier institution of measures to limit the spread of infection. The early diagnosis of MSSA infection, does lead to treatment with specific antibiotic therapy at an earlier stage of treatment. Also, the duration of empiric therapy is greatly reduced by early diagnosis. The early diagnosis of coagulase negative staphylococcal infection leads to a lower rate of unnecessary treatment for these infections as they are commonly considered contaminants. ...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{advances}} in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} acute stroke increase the impor-tance of providing these patients with timely medical attention. This study was designed to assess time delays in neurological evaluation and neuroimaging and to determine whether they are important obstacles to performing thrombolytic therapy. Met h ods: Data were obtained between May 2004 and September 2006 from 195 consecutive patients who were admitted to Cheju National University Hospital for acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. We determined the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the onset <b>of</b> symptoms, arrival <b>time</b> at the emergency department (ED), and <b>times</b> <b>of</b> neurology <b>notification,</b> neurology evaluation, and neuroimaging using interviews and by reviewing the medical record. Resul t s: Short onset-to-door time, performing computed tomography rather than magnetic resonance imaging, presence of aphasia or motor weakness, and severe initial neurological deficit were significantly associated with reduced in-hospital delays. Seventeen (20 %) of the 85 patients who arrived within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms received intravenous thrombolysis. Mild neurological deficit, rapidly improving symptoms, and insufficient time to workup were the main causes of the nonreceipt of thrombolytic therapy in these patients. Only one patient did not receive thrombolytic therapy due to delay in neurology consultation. C oncl usi ons: Whilst in-hospital delays were not major obstacles to performing thrombolytic therapy in this study...|$|R
