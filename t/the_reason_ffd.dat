30|$|The {{morphology}} of TNT arrays on FTO substrates {{was controlled}} by altering applied voltage and anodizing duration. Debris-free TNT arrays with a length of 3.9  μm and a pore diameter of 51  nm were successfully prepared and used for subsequent Ag nanoparticle deposition and DSSC fabrication. The deposited Ag was mainly distributed at {{the upper part of}} TNT arrays (until ~ 1  μm from the top), so the bottom part was almost in the absence of Ag. Evaluated DSSC performance unveiled that Ag nanoparticle deposition was effective to increase JSC and FF, while VOC was unaffected. Although <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>FF</b> was improved was still unclear, the increased JSC was well explained in terms of enhanced light-harvesting ability by LSPR of Ag nanoparticles. Since TiCl 4 treatment, dye purification, and optimization of Ag loading quantity and TNT length were not carried out in this work, much higher conversion efficiency can be expected in the future.|$|R

The size effect is a default effect, and this is also largely true for the book-to-market (BM) effect. Both exist only in segments of the market with high default risk. Default risk is systematic risk.

We have carried out a large scale experiment where we ran all configurations of FF's new techniques on a sizeable set of planning tasks. We describe the experimental design, and present our findings. The results give a clear picture of what <b>the</b> most important <b>reasons</b> are for <b>FF's</b> performance advantage over HSP. ...|$|R
