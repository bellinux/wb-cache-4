5|$|As the Japanese {{government}} plan <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> slots at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport by 2020, Japan Airlines {{intends to}} order more widebodies for growth in 2018 or 2019: it could exercise its 25 options on Airbus A350s {{on top of}} its 31 firm orders, due for delivery from 2019, and study others like the proposed Boeing New Midsize Airplane or the 787-10 to add to its 787-9 with 10 remaining to be delivered.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> options for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely {{seen as the}} product of an effort by local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence Air to serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a production control committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
50|$|Neil Breytenbach {{joined the}} band on the {{keyboards}} in July 2007 and pre-production of “All Or Nothing” commenced {{before the end}} of the year. Neil's arrival opened the band up <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> keyboards <b>to</b> their songs, especially in live performances.|$|R
50|$|The mall was renovated in {{the fall}} of 2006 to {{coincide}} {{with the opening of the}} expanded Bloomingdale's. In addition <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> chairs and sitting areas, a large handicapped-accessible elevator was installed in the central atrium close to the main, Route 9, entrance.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the group}} mainly did covers of songs that were radio hits the crowds could dance <b>to,</b> <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> {{acoustic}} numbers meant writing original songs {{for the band}} in that format. The band also needed more material for an album, so Nancy and Ann set about doing both.|$|R
5|$|The great {{advantage}} Campbell's filters {{had over the}} RL circuit and other simple filters of the time was {{that they could be}} designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or steepness of transition between pass band and stop band. It was only necessary <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> filter sections until the desired response was obtained.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} at first, but he was soon identified, {{and within a few}} days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> to the story as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing {{the characters in the}} end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E

Errors in the 1531 edition were corrected in addition <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> chapter summaries and parallel passages. It was during the 1530s, {{following the death of}} Zwingli, that Jud began to gain an international reputation as Reformer and Biblical scholar.|$|R

5|$|Florida International University has {{seventeen}} varsity sports teams, {{named the}} Panthers. The Panthers' athletic colors are blue and gold, and {{compete in the}} NCAA Division I as part of Conference USA in all sports. Three main sports facilities serve as home venues for Panther athletics. The Panthers football team plays at FIU Stadium ("The Cage"), the men and women's basketball and volleyball teams play at the FIU Arena, and the men's baseball team plays at FIU Baseball Stadium. Other athletics venues include the Aquatic Center, Tennis Complex, softball fields, and various other recreational fields. FIU Arena underwent expansion <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> seating and a modernization of the exterior that was completed in late 2011. On July 1, 2013, FIU {{became a member of}} Conference USA.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> stories to the tower because of the atrium on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E

5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> details {{to the character}} designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Pluton {{spent much}} of 1933–1935 in {{dockyard}} hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 April 1933. She was refitted four times during this period <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects. These included reinforcement of her superstructure {{where it had been}} damaged by the muzzle blast from her 138mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones. A high-angle fire-control director for her 75mm guns was added, two of her 75mm gun were converted to powered, remotely controlled mounts, gun shields were added to the 75mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck.|$|E

5|$|Robert Cook wrote Gumball for {{publication}} by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund {{had a reputation}} as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs move through the pipes.|$|E
5|$|Summer Hill has {{a mix of}} Federation-era houses, with medium density {{apartment}} blocks near the railway station. Local independent business people run most of the shops. The local council has defined a village character for the suburb. Summer Hill is a suburb rich in heritage. More than one hundred properties are heritage listed, and the strong feelings of some residents of the suburb towards protecting the local architecture has seen {{the introduction of a}} heritage review, which is expected <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> properties to the heritage register.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and would not be able <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> for some time.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall, an {{employee}} at Bohemia working on ARMA 3, released a massively popular mod for Arma II named DayZ, which includes zombies as the game's main enemies. Its popularity led to a resurgence in ARMA 2s sales, with registered players count being raised from 500,000 to one million. Impressed {{with the success of}} DayZ, Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone DayZ video game, which ensured {{that he would not be}} limited by the restraints of Arma 2. While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>more</b> content such as base-building and improved crafting. Hall eventually left Bohemia in 2014, and the game remained in early access more than four years after its release in December 2013.|$|E
