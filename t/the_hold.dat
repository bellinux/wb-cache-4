5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. <b>The</b> <b>hold</b> lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>holding</b> device has {{a carrier}} {{on which a}} holding element is {{attached}} to receive the workpiece. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> element is designed to fit the shape of workpiece {{so that it can}} only be used for identical types of workpieces. <b>The</b> <b>holding</b> device is designed so that it can retain a large number of differently shaped workpieces. <b>The</b> <b>holding</b> element is therefore provided with at least one magnet whose poles are adjustable. In one pole position, <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> element is held to the carrier by magnet force and in the other pole position, it can be removed from the carrier. In the latter pole position, the magnetic circuit is diverted from the carrier so that <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> element can easily be removed from the carrier or placed in another position on it. By repositioning <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> elements, workpieces of different shapes can be perfectly held. <b>The</b> <b>holding</b> device can be used on machine tools, automatic assembly stations or similar...|$|R

5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against The Great Khali. Khali {{attacked}} Cena early in the match, but Cena countered and gained the advantage. Cena performed a diving legdrop bulldog and followed by putting Khali in the STFU. Cena forced Khali to submit to <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> but Khali's foot was under the rope, meaning Cena should have broken <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> The referee, however, did not see this and declared Cena the winner. Cena retained the WWE Championship and gained possession of the belt, which Khali had kayfabe stolen prior to the event.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the cargo}} is discharged, the crew begins to clean <b>the</b> <b>holds.</b> This is {{particularly}} important if the next cargo is of a different type. The immense size of cargo <b>holds</b> and <b>the</b> tendency of cargoes to be physically irritating add {{to the difficulty of}} cleaning <b>the</b> <b>holds.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>holds</b> are clean, <b>the</b> process of loading begins.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWF Championship, as Bret Hart defended the title against Razor Ramon. Ramon got the early {{advantage}} by punching Hart repeatedly but accidentally hit his knee against a turnbuckle while running at Hart. Hart applied a figure-four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's knee. Ramon escaped <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> and threw Hart against a ring post; he capitalized on this advantage by attacking Hart's back. Ramon threw Hart with a fallaway slam and applied a bear hug. Hart escaped <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> by biting Ramon. He threw Ramon {{out of the ring}} and performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow drop from the second rope. Hart applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, but Ramon grabbed the ropes, which forced the referee to instruct Hart to break <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> Hart threw Ramon with a belly-to-back suplex, but Ramon responded by attempting to perform the Razor's Edge, his signature move. Hart reversed this into an unsuccessful pin attempt. With both men exhausted, Hart applied the Sharpshooter and won the match by forcing Ramon to submit.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a {{standard}} match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. The match started with Masters applying the Masterlock on Michaels. After breaking <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> Michaels delivered a clothesline and knife edged chops. Masters, however, dominated Michaels, focusing {{on his back}} by powerbombing Michaels several times. He also lifted Michaels vertically {{in the air and}} stalled him there before slamming him down. Michaels fought back, as he delivered a Diving Elbow Drop. Masters was able to lock in the Masterlock once more. Michaels tried to use the corners to break <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> but Masters kept it locked on. Michaels then leaped over the top rope and landed on the ring apron, causing the referee to order Masters to break <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> Michaels countered with a Sweet Chin Music, thus Michaels got the pinfall victory over Masters.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{increases}} in force, breaking the mast, tearing the sails and flooding <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> All four manage to survive by lashing {{themselves to the}} hull. As the storm abates, they find themselves safe for the moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by starvation and thirst.|$|E

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} {{magnesium alloy}} matrix composites were fabricated by using liquidâsolid extrusion directly following vacuum infiltration technique. The experimental {{results showed that}} the microstructures of Cf/Mg composites depended on <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pressure. <b>The</b> porosity was reduced gradually, and the densification was improved obviously, respectively, with the increase of <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pressure. <b>The</b> densification, hardness and Ultimate tensile strength of Cf/Mg composites were significantly improved as <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pressure increased in the range of 0. 1 â 15 MPa. The densification was not obvious, but the UTS of the Cf/Mg composites decreased gradually as <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pressure increased in the range of 25 â 45 MPa. The Cf/Mg composites presented a good performance when <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pressure was about 15 MPa...|$|R

5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed to slip out of the choke. Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
