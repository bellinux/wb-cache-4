500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
5000|$|In 1845 Revels {{was ordained}} as a {{minister}} in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME); {{he served as a}} preacher and religious teacher throughout the Midwest: in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kansas. [...] "At <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{with a great deal of}} opposition," [...] he later recalled. [...] "I was imprisoned in Missouri in 1854 for preaching the gospel to Negroes, though I was never subjected to violence." [...] During these years, he voted in Ohio.|$|R

2500|$|Konoe {{justified}} his demission to {{his secretary}} Kenji Tomita. [...] "Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and {{he wished to}} avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling {{marked the}} anniversary of Morgan's death with [...] "Ah Ted", an event held in Dublin's Tivoli Variety Theatre. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, Patrick McDonnell, Joe Rooney and Michael Redmond reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, {{withstanding}} one wrestler's attack on his crotch because he has [...] "no willy", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's [...] "The <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> the Devil", which follows him {{on the way to}} give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stories of}} their {{encounters}} with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him [...] "you're very sexy" [...] and also pinched his bottom. In November, the British Royal Family were considered {{fans of the}} Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: [...] "These are my heroes. This {{is one of the}} greatest moments in my life" [...] in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, [...] "It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> them was the greatest". Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter [...] "with lots of love" [...] when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: [...] "What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Daniel's death {{certificate}} was issued on September 21, 2006, {{so that he}} could be buried. While Smith remained in the Bahamas with Dannielynn and Stern, Daniel's family in the United States, including his father, Billy Smith, gathered with friends on October 7, 2006, in Mexia, Texas, for a memorial service. Daniel was buried at Lake View Cemetery on New Providence, Bahamas, on October 19, 2006, almost six weeks after his death. According to Howard K. Stern, Smith's longtime boyfriend, she was devastated over her son's death. [...] "Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question {{the most important person in}} Anna's life," [...] Stern told Florida Circuit Judge Larry Seidlin during his testimony in Smith's body custody trial: [...] "At Daniel's funeral, she had them open the coffin and tried to climb inside. She said that 'if Daniel has to be buried, I want to be buried with him,'" [...] Stern testified. [...] "She was ready to go down with him." [...] Howard K. Stern revealed that [...] "Anna saw herself as both mother and father to Daniel. From the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her, everything was for Daniel. I would say that physically, she died last week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Parcaut {{was born}} in Iowa on December 3, 1896. His parents, Edward and Eva Parcaut, were farmers who, in 1894, had settled {{on a farm in}} Grant Township an area near Sutherland a small town in O'Brien County, Iowa. [...] They had a family of seven children. From an early age, Parcaut took a keen {{interest}} in wrestling with other boys and began to demonstrate considerable aptitude for the sport. In 1906, at the age of 15, a local wrestling fan, impressed with Parcaut's talent and potential, gave him $100.00, a considerable sum of money at the time, to seek training from famed wrestler and instructor Martin [...] "Farmer" [...] Burns. [...] At the time, Burns operated a school for wrestlers in Omaha, Nebraska where he taught [...] "catch as catch can" [...] or modern day freestyle wrestling and physical training. [...] Parcaut traveled to Omaha, his $100.00 buying him 10 lessons, as Farmer Burns charged $10.00 an hour for one-on-one wrestling instruction with students. [...] Burns instilled in young Parcaut what would become a lifelong regimen of training and most importantly, [...] "clean living." [...] As Parcaut recalled years later, [...] "I'll never forget the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him in Omaha ... All {{the way back to the}} gymnasium he talked to me about the evils of drink and of smoking and even urged me not to partake of tea or coffee." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} {{expressed}} anything but indifference, {{as it is}} such a long <b>time</b> since <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him. But <b>I</b> never fancied him much. I suppose we were not the same sort of men; and then, too, perhaps I am rather prejudiced from the fact that I know that he was considered rather a hard landlord." ...|$|R

6000|$|These apprehensions were greatly {{increased}} {{by the desire}} which King Mehevi {{and several of the}} inferior chiefs now manifested that I should be tattooed. The pleasure of the king was first signified to me some three days after my casual encounter with Karky the artist. Heavens! what imprecations I showered upon that Karky. Doubtless he had plotted a conspiracy against me and my countenance, and would never rest until his diabolical purpose was accomplished. Several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him {{in various parts of the}} valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he came running after me with his mallet and chisel, flourishing them about my face as if he longed to begin. What an object he would have made of me! ...|$|R
