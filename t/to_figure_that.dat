50|$|Robert O. Gjerdingen sees {{a change}} in Wanhal's style as he {{redirected}} his attention towards the middle class, his music becoming didactic {{in the sense that}} it employed musical figures in a clear and self-referential manner, rather than the seamless continuity from figure <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> had characterized his earlier pieces. In this, Gjerdingen sees Wanhal as prefiguring Beethoven.|$|E
