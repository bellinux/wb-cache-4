5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} known of the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E
5|$|The Bombardment of Salé was a naval {{attack against}} the Moroccan city of Salé that took place between 26 and 27 November 1851, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of a French cargo ship by residents of the city.

5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by {{the authorities}} to have participated in <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of an Istanbul-bound caravan from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul. However, Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived safely in Istanbul and that {{the commander of the}} caravan, Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul. About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem was an {{important}} city of the Byzantine province of Palestina Prima. Just 23 {{years prior to the}} Muslim conquest, in 614, it fell to an invading Sassanid army under Shahrbaraz during the last of the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars. The Persians looted the city, and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants. As part of <b>the</b> <b>looting,</b> the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was destroyed and the True Cross captured and taken to Ctesiphon as a battle-captured holy relic. The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor Heraclius after his final victory against the Persians in 628. It was believed that the Jews, who were persecuted in their Roman-controlled homeland, had aided the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 he {{designed}} a Benedictine monastery and a church {{dedicated to the}} Holy Spirit in Villaricos (Cuevas de Vera, Almeria) for his former teacher, Joan Martorell. It was of neo-Gothic design, similar to the Convent of the Salesians that Gaudí also planned with Martorell. Ultimately it was not carried out, and the project plans were destroyed in <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of the Sagrada Família in 1936. The same year he was tasked with constructing a hunting lodge and wine cellars at a country residence known as La Cuadra, in Garraf (Sitges), property of baron Eusebi Güell. Ultimately the wine cellars, but not the lodge, were built some years later. With Martorell he also collaborated on three other projects: {{the church of the}} Jesuit School in Carrer Caspe; the Convent of the Salesians in Passeig de Sant Joan, a neo-Gothic project with an altar in the centre of the crossing; and the facade project for Barcelona cathedral, for the competition convened by the cathedral chapter in 1882, ultimately won by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras.|$|E

5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} that officers control their troops and stop <b>the</b> <b>looting.</b> Two {{days later the}} council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an incentive for the other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of the unrest, on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{troubles}} in the south-east spread north, slowed {{by the poor}} communication links of medieval England. In Leicester, where John of Gaunt had a substantial castle, warnings arrived of a force of rebels advancing on the city from Lincolnshire, who were intent on destroying the castle and its contents. The mayor and the town mobilised their defences, including a local militia, but the rebels never arrived. John of Gaunt was in Berwick when word reached him on 17 June of the revolt. Not knowing that Wat Tyler had by now been killed, John of Gaunt placed his castles in Yorkshire and Wales on alert. Fresh rumours, many of them incorrect, continued to arrive in Berwick, suggesting widespread rebellions across the west and east of England and <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of the ducal household in Leicester; rebel units were even said to be hunting for the Duke himself. Gaunt began to march to Bamburgh Castle, but then changed course and diverted north into Scotland, only returning south once the fighting was over.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the Swedes, as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the Swedes (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with the Swedes when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), that in the end had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E
