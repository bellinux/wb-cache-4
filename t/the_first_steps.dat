5|$|Ashmole {{was born}} in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family had been prominent, but its {{fortunes}} had declined {{by the time of}} Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended Lichfield Grammar School (now King Edward VI School) and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget's sons, and in 1638, with James Paget's help, he qualified as a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a déclassé Cheshire aristocratic family, who died, while pregnant, only three years later on 6 December 1641. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>steps</b> towards status and wealth. He also became allied with Major-General Charles Worsley (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at Westminster Abbey), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John Booth, of Salford.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to {{construct}} locally robust semiparametric GMM estimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> {{does not affect the}} asymptotic variance. They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment term for <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimation. Locally robust estimators have several advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the specification of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step.</b> They are doubly robust for affine moment functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one <b>first</b> <b>step</b> component is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is flatter as a function of <b>first</b> <b>step</b> smoothing leading to improved small sample properties. Series <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimators confer local robustness on any moment conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, {{in the direction of the}} series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given here, including for economic structural models. We give simple asymptotic theory for estimators that use cross-fitting in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> including machine learning. Comment: 42 page...|$|R

5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>steps</b> towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>steps</b> towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E

40|$|Insect eggs store many lipid {{droplets}} as {{an energy}} source for embryonic development.

In this study, we focused on how lipids were incorporated into the embryo in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> compared with <b>the</b> mechanisms used in the second step, by means of transmission electron microscopy using the high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution method. At the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> (blastoderm formation stage), some lipid droplets were observed in each cell of the embryonic tissues.

At the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> (late appendage formation stage), some lipid droplets were attached to the elongated rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). It seemed that formation of the lipid droplets occurred in embryonic cells at the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> because <b>the</b> rER is the site of biogenesis of lipid droplets. The incorporation of lipid droplets in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> may be subdivided into two stages: the blastoderm formation stage and the subsequent stage before blastokinesis...|$|R
