5|$|Bryars {{approached}} Blake Morrison in May 1988 {{with the}} suggestion of working on an opera based on Verne's novella. At the time Morrison knew neither the Verne story nor Bryars's music but he agreed to the proposal after a lunchtime meeting with the composer. They worked <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> concert piece which was premiered as Doctor Ox's Experiment (Epilogue) by the soprano Sarah Leonard and the Gavin Bryars Ensemble in November 1988.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2007, the New Breed was {{phased out}} as a group. Cor Von and Burke {{remained}} loosely aligned and teamed <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few occasions until mid-June. After this, Cor Von took an extended leave of absence before being released from the company in September. Burke remained part of ECW and received a push in late June and July, challenging for the ECW World Championship on several occasions. Throughout the remainder of 2007 and most of 2008, he was rarely used in a prominent role and was released in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has also}} {{branched}} out into television, and later, internet-based series. His {{first foray into}} the medium was Twin Peaks, {{a joint venture with}} Mark Frost. Twin Peaks became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of other projects, including On the Air, and American Chronicles. In 2002 Lynch began producing two series of shorts released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on-camera in Twin Peaks, Zelly and Me and Dune. From 2007, Lynch has appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show.|$|E

5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
5|$|The {{score to}} Zombi 2 was {{composed}} by Fabio Frizzi, who frequently scored Fulci's works, including Sette note in nero, I quattro dell'apocalisse and Sella d'argento previously.

5|$|When a Catholic {{priest is}} burnt {{at the stake}} in Lander, Wyoming, private investigative {{organisation}} the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. At {{the scene of the}} drowning, two wedding rings are found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E
5|$|As Sadness reinstalls {{the core}} memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives {{home to her}} parents and breaks down crying, confessing that she misses Minnesota. As her parents comfort her, they tell her that they also miss Minnesota and Joy and Sadness work the console together, {{creating}} a new core memory that combines their emotions; a new island forms representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. In the end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a few new ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions). Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production {{side of the}} project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists {{to appear on the}} show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E

5|$|Everybody Saves Father and The Only Girl in Camp were {{released}} <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on January 10, 1911. The total length of Everybody Saves Father is approximately 450 {{feet long and}} the Only Girl in Camp is 480 feet long. Though both films were on a split reel, sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only. Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California. A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold on eBay in 2009. The film was purchased and deposited in the Library of Congress for preservation.|$|E
5|$|Gone to Coney Island and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to Coney Island is a comedy that features Coney Island, which the mere subject would {{make for a}} successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to Coney Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because Coney Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Al Costello {{reformed}} the tag team The Fabulous Kangaroos with Ray St. Clair {{who retired}} {{after six months}} with knee problems. A few months after St. Clair retired, Costello found Don Kent to don the bush hat. Kent, who was from Michigan, adopted the Ultra-Australian gimmick (but retained his American accent) and a second version of the Fabulous Kangaroos was formed. Costello and Kent teamed <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular basis from 1968 until 1974, approximately {{the same amount of}} time that Costello spent teaming with his original partner Roy Heffernan. The Kangaroos won their first tag team championship a few months after teaming up, during a tour of Japan for “International Wrestling Enterprise". Over the years, they defended their title in promotions around the globe. In Canada, they were the first Eastern Sports Association International Tag Team Champions; in the World Wrestling Association, they held the WWA World Tag Team Championship twice. In addition to winning titles all over North America, they also made appearances for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In December, {{the second}} Block I flight AS-205 was {{canceled}} as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1. McDivitt's crew was now promoted to prime {{crew of the}} Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 launch vehicle would be used in place of AS-207. A third manned mission was planned to launch the CSM and LM <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Saturn V (AS-503) to an elliptical medium Earth orbit (MEO), to be crewed by Frank Borman, Michael Collins and William Anders. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart had started their training for AS-258 in CM-101 at the NAA plant in Downey, California, when the Apollo 1 accident occurred.|$|E
5|$|In October 1999 {{during an}} online {{question}} and answer session, John Carmack, while discussing that the original founders of id Software were unlikely to ever work <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> game again, mentioned that he was considering {{the idea of making}} a Commander Keen game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. Activision formally announced at the start of May 2001 that a new Commander Keen game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released {{at the end of the}} month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as the developer for the project as they had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games. While Palmer was the developer for the game, id collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and {{kept in touch with}} the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug if he wanted to come to Hawaii with him.|$|E
