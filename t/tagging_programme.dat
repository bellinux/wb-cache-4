40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Tuna {{are often}} found in {{association}} with floating objects and remain near them. Taking advantage of this behavior, man-made floating objects, referred to as fish aggregating devices (FADs) are commonly used in tuna purse seine sheries. As much as half of the worlds tuna catch now comes from schools associated with FADs as their use continues to rise. Despite the prevalence of FAD, {{little is known about}} FADs effects on tuna movement. In this dissertation, I modified the Advection-Diffusion Reaction (ADR) model with the inclusion of FAD effects by modeling the attraction and hindering tendencies of FAD to tuna. In my ADR-FAD model, the advection and diffusion are modulated by FAD distribution. To verify the ADR-FAD model, more than 10, 000 simulations were conducted using conventional tag release-recapture data, shing e ort data and FAD sets data as a proxy for FAD distribution. Skipjack tag data from the Pacific Tuna <b>Tagging</b> <b>Programme</b> was analyzed using the ADR-FAD model and the original ADR model. Both models show similar results but the ADR-FAD model fits signiffcantly better than the ADR model. Differences in the effects of FAD between the open and coastal ocean were found, suggesting FAD use should be managed and regulated differently between the coastal and open ocean. I also applied the ADR-FAD model to two different skipjack tag datasets from the Regional Tuna <b>Tagging</b> <b>Programme</b> (1989 - 1992) and the Pacific Tuna <b>Tagging</b> <b>Programme</b> (2006 -present) to compare the effects of FAD over the two periods. The density of FAD increased three folds since the 1990 's, and the spatial distribution differs between the two periods. FAD induced skipjack movement is significantly higher in the 2000 's, while diffusive movement in the 2000 's is reduced when compared to the 1990 's. Even though tuna movement is tied to environmental and trophic conditions, model results indicate rapid expansion in FAD use exerts considerable influences on tuna movement...|$|E

40|$|Exchange of {{immature}} loggerhead {{sea turtles}} (Caretta caretta) between {{the northern and}} southern regions of the western Mediterranean was investigated using data obtained from several Spanish <b>tagging</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Tagged</b> turtles ranged in straight carapace length from 23. 0 to 74. 0 cm. Thirty-six turtles were recaptured after an average interval of 390. 5 Â± 462. 6 days (SD). As the mean dispersal distance (MDD) of a turtle population that spreads over the western Mediterranean would stabilize after 117 days (CI 95 %: 98 to 149), two analyses were conducted that included data from turtles recaptured after 98 and 149 days respectively. In both analyses, turtles were recaptured more often than expected in the same region where they had been tagged. No difference was found in either of the two regions between the average distance between the capture and recapture locations and the expected MDD if the turtles were to remain in the region where they were first captured. Turtles recaptured after 15 and 25 days respectively were excluded from the analysis to ensure data independence. The overall evidence indicates that immature turtles exhibit strong site fidelity to certain areas {{and that there is a}} strong barrier to dispersal between {{the northern and southern}} parts of the western Mediterranean.

40|$|Noumea, New Caledonia) Tagging (or mark-recapture) studies {{generally}} {{require the}} assumption that tagged and untagged individuals (of a particular demographic group) are equally likely to be captured.

An annual survival probability of 0. 73 (CI 95 % = 0. 67 - 0. 78; n= 3254) was obtained, and should be considered as a conservative estimate due to an unknown, though not negligible, tag loss rate.

The assessment uses the stock assessment model and computer software known as MULTIFAN-CL. The skipjack tuna model is age (16 age-classes) and spatially structured and the catch, effort, size composition and tagging data used in the model are classified by 24 fisheries and quarterly time periods from 1952 through 2007. The catch, size and tagging data used in the assessment were updated from the 2005 assessment. A large amount of tagging data was integrated in the assessment model, although the current assessment does not include tag releases and recoveries from the recent PNG and Solomon Islands <b>tagging</b> <b>programmes.</b> For each region, a standardised effort series was calculated from a GLM analysis of catch and effort data from the Japanese distant-water pole-and-line fishery.

40|$|Surface-schooling, adult {{skipjack}} tuna (> 40 cm fork length, FL) are {{commonly found in}} tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Skipjack in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) are considered a single stock for assessment purposes (Wild and Hampton 1994). In the western Pacific, warm, poleward-flowing currents near northern Japan and southern Australia extend their distribution to 40 Â°N and 40 Â°S. These limits roughly correspond to the 20 Â°C surface isotherm. A substantial amount of information on skipjack movement is available from <b>tagging</b> <b>programmes</b> (Figure 1). In general, skipjack movement is highly variable (Sibert et al. 1999) but {{is thought to be}} influenced by large-scale oceanographic variability (Lehodey et al. 1997). Skipjack growth is rapid compared to yellowfin and bigeye tuna. In the Pacific, approximate age estimates from tagging and otoliths indicate FLs of 45, 64, 75, and 80 cm for ages 1 â 4; though significant differences occur between individuals. The longest period at liberty for a tagged skipjack was 4. 5 years. Estimates of natural mortality rate have been obtained using a size-structured tag attrition model (Hampton 2000), which indicated that natural mortality was substantially larger for small skipjack (21 â 30 cm FL, M= 0. 8 mo- 1) than larger skipjack (51 â 70 cm FL, M= 0. 12 â 0. 15 mo- 1). 1. 2 Fisherie...|$|R
40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the survival of rays, which are caught commercially in a target trawl fishery in the Bristol Channel, and subsequently discarded. The study was proposed by the NFFO and categorized by Defra and Cefas as priority for support. All ray and skate species are commonly marketed as skate. The status of several skate and ray stocks in the Northeast Atlantic is of concern, with some species classified as depleted while others are locally extirpated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) estimate the short-term discard survival rates of thornback rays; (2) estimate the longterm discard survival rates of the most commercially important ray species; and (3) investigate the effect of codend weight on ray discard survival. The short-term survival estimates were made using specially designed holding tanks to retain thornback rays on board during three 4 -day trips on the FV âOur Olivia Belleâ. These holding tank experiments were supplemented with a <b>tagging</b> <b>programme</b> in which 900 thornback, small-eyed, blonde and spotted rays were caught, tagged and released. Information on tagged rays, when caught again in the future, will be used to estimate the longer-term survival of discarded rays. Consequently, the results from the <b>tagging</b> <b>programme</b> can only be presented once sufficient tags have been returned, and will be included in a future report. The short-term survival experiments showed that for every three thornback rays returned to sea in the Bristol Channel ray fishery, an estimated two survive for at least 3 days. The few tag returns received so far show that discarded rays are surviving for at least 45 days. The study indicated that as total catch weight and tow duration increases, the survival rate for discarded rays decreases; also, that large thornback rays do not have greater rates of survival than small rays. The implications of these results for the management of ray fisheries are discussed. ...|$|E

Both tagging programmes known as the Indian Ocean Tuna Tagging Project (IOTTP), targeted three main species of tuna commercially exploited in the Indian Ocean: bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares). The two programmes tagged 219, 149 tuna and 34, 294 recaptures were reported to the commission. This study focused on tuna behaviour in the Indian Ocean looking at seasonal impacts, inter-annual variability in relation to ocean environment, survival estimates, movement patterns, size-groups and school-type: Free Schools (FS) and Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Using a multivariate approach, {{it was found that}} the years 2005 to 2007 were most abundant in recoveries of skipjack adults (77. 45 %) while yellowfin adults were mainly abundant during 2008 to 2011. It also showed that year and zone were significant factors influencing local abundance in tuna. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves enabled estimates on the longevity of the three species to be made. It was estimated that the cohorts (99 %) vanished at 12, 5. 8 and 10 years for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin, respectively. The years 2006 (cold-productive phase) and 2007 (warmchlorophyll depleted phase) showed tuna movement patterns changing with an El NiËno event and primary productivity. Tuna tagged in the Tanzanian region, showed that those under FADs moved pre-dominantly towards the Somalian and Seychelles waters, while those in FS moved to the Seychelles and Mozambique waters. General Additive Model (GAM) analyses showed that the area bounded by 5 â°N- 5 â°S and 45 â°- 55 â°E was the main tag recovery regions for tuna under FADs. While in FS, the core recovery region was observed to be from 0 â°N- 10 â°S and 50 â°- 60 â°E. Recoveries were distributed in the temperature range 25 - 29 â°C.

Numbers tagged and recaptured varied among fishing zones, seasons and years. Recapture rates varied among areas, fishers and sizes of fish. Small fish showed less movement than large fish, but few fish > 1000 mm TL were tagged. The majority of fish were recaptured within 50 km of where they were tagged, although there was an indication that fish that were at large longer moved further. The maximum distance moved was 3000 km and the maximum time at liberty was 1742 days. Quantitative analyses of life-history parameters from data collected in cooperative tagging programmes are generally not possible because there are usually no estimates of fishing effort, tag-related mortality and tag loss. These are likely to vary not only along the coast, but also among taggers. Cooperative tagging programmes provide some useful biological data (e. g. movement from point x to point y, and growth), but dedicated tagging programmes may be needed for estimates of other life-history parameters (e. g. mortality) and of abundance.

There are 76 drift net licences in the Bay which incorporates two fishery districts, Galway and Connemara. The vessels used vary from 5 metre currachs to 20 metre trawlers. The majority of the boats are half deckers of between 9 and 11 metres. The fishery starts in mid-May but the bulk of the catch is taken in June and July. The main component of the catch is grilse with an average weight of 3 kg. During the period fishing is carried on over 24 hours daily except for the weekly close season time. The fishery extends from west of a straight line from Spiddal Harbour to Blackhead, Co Clare in the east, and from Slyne Head to Hag's Head, Co.

The spatial distributions of ABFT showed little year-to-year variation and the fish concentrated in a small area of the central northwestern Mediterranean, where they may stay for several months. The individual tracks display sinuous trajectories in this area, indicating the possibility of feeding behaviour. No fish went out to the North Atlantic, but several fish displayed some migration to the southern western Mediterranean Sea during winter and the central Mediterranean during the spawning season. The homing behaviour of one fish after a full year as well as the back and forth of several fish further indicates that this restricted feeding area is probably persistent from year to year. We hypothesize that this area could result from local enrichment due to permanent mesoscale oceanographic features related to the North Mediterranean Current and the North Balearic front. The option of a spatial management, through marine protected areas, for a highly migratory species, such as ABFT, thus deserves more careful consideration because those species displayed complex spatial dynamics (e. g. homing), and population structure (e. g. several subpopulations of different sizes) ...|$|E

These results are based on a small sample of 75 bigeye and 100 yellowfin recovered during 5 years in the entire western Indian Ocean. All these recoveries have been very well measured by scientists and their time at liberty is well known. These results are showing and for the 2 species marked differences in growth rates and in the asymptotic sizes of male and female: males showing higher growth rates and larger asymptotic sizes. They also indicate that natural mortality of female yellowfin would be moderately larger than for males, and nearly identical for the 2 sexes of bigeye. It is concluded that these results are probably valid ones in the Indian Ocean, {{and that there is a}} serious possibility that similar biological results could also be valid ones in other oceans. It is recommended that WCPFC and IATTC should start a similar sampling program of their recoveries of large bigeye and yellowfin, especially those caught by purse seiners that are easily identified and sampled by observers. Future work should also be developed to incorporate better the complexity of these results in future tuna stock assessment models. VersiÃ³n del edito...|$|E

The objective of this cruise and other sub-regional components of the PTTP is to target difficult to access areas of the Central Pacific (including French Polynesia) to improve overall spatial coverage of PTTP tag releases. The Double D is a Honolulu-based multi-purpose pelagic handline/longline vessel equipped with the full complement of Hawaiian-style tuna handline gears in addition to hydraulic trolling reels. The vessel is also equipped with two mini longline reels for conventional or targeted short-set longline fishing on tuna and pomphret aggregations. A total of 1909 tropical tunas were tagged and released during the cruise comprising 1736 bigeye (90. 9 %), 57 skipjac...|$|E
40|$|FSP North Thames cod <b>tagging</b> <b>{{programme}}.</b> The {{aim of the}} programme was {{to investigate}} spatial movements of adult cod, a species known to aggregate annually between January and March (during spawning) in the North Thames and Shipwash area. In all, 233 cod were captured during the study with a mean length of 61 cm (Â± 10 cm) and a mean weight of 3 kg (Â± 1 kg). Of these, 217 were tagged externally with plastic mark-recapture tags (T-bar anchor tags), and another 14 were tagged internally with electronic data storage tags (DSTs) before being released back to the wild within close proximity of their capture position. Of the 233 cod captured, 203 were classed as adults based on maturity ogives derived from International Bottom Trawl Survey data (ICES, 2005). The cod caught were mainly mature females (61 %), with just a few males readily identified (3 %) and a further 36 % for which the sex could not be determined. To date (20 May 2010), 12 marked/tagged cod have been recaptured and were at liberty between 6 and 61 days (Â± 15 days). They had travelled between 3 and 136 km in a straight line (Â± 34 km). The greatest distance travelled (136 km) was by a cod at liberty for 25 days before being recaptured in the eastern English Channel by a gillnetter 3 miles off Hastings in the neighbouring ICES management area, VIId...|$|E

50|$|Even {{up to the}} mid-1980s, rugby on the Rock had a major problem, {{namely the}} lack of grass. Games were {{frequently}} played on a rocky surface, and visitors had to play tag rugby. Peter Collings, a former Blackburn and Leek winger, the Headmaster of St George's School, and others like Geoff Dunn of the Bat and Bull pub, kept Rugby alive via the tag game. Peter Collings was a one-man band for some ten years. He played and refereed, organised fixtures, the disciplinary committee and the pitch allocations.. Fixtures occurred most weekends at the Devils Tower pitch and at Navy No 1 on Queensway. There were also regular and well attended Rugby Sevens events that took place, with recorded coverage from GBC television on John Shepherd's sports <b>programmes.</b> <b>Tag</b> rugby had its limitations, but with regular trips to play in Tangier against Moroccan and French teams, it allowed Rugby skills to flourish and for the game to stay alive in Gibraltar during the 1970s and 1980s when travel to Spain was impractical.|$|R
40|$|The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) is {{a coastal}} bentho-pelagic species {{that is highly}} migratory and has a {{widespread}} distribution in temperate waters. This species matures late, has a relatively low fecundity and is slow growing, which makes it vulnerable to overfishing. They are commercially fished throughout their distribution, and some global stocks have been under pressure because of poor management. In Australia, longline and gillnet fisheries targeted pregnant females and juveniles around Victorian and Tasmanian nursery grounds, resulting in loss of historical inshore nursery habitat. School shark <b>tagging</b> <b>programmes</b> have reported migration between Australian and New Zealand stocks, but preliminary genetic {{studies have suggested that}} there are slight genetic differences between the stocks. Currently, the Australian and New Zealand school shark fisheries are assessed and managed as separate stocks. However, the question of whether this species is comprised of a single population or multiple sub-populations in the South Pacific remains unresolved. Given the commercial importance of the school shark fisheries and the concern about stock levels on the regional and trans-Tasman scales, knowledge of stock structure is essential for effective management. The aim of this thesis research was to determine the levels of genetic diversity and population structure of G. galeus in New Zealand and Australia, and compare these to a population in Chile, using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and microsatellite DNA markers. The DNA sequence of an 893 base pair region of the mtDNA control region (CR) was determined using 475 school shark samples and nine microsatellite DNA loci were genotyped in 239 individuals. Analyses of the data revealed strong evidence of genetic differentiation between G. galeus populations in Australasia and Chile, suggesting restricted gene flow among populations in the western and eastern areas of the Pacific Ocean. The FST values ranged from 0. 188 to 0. 300 for CR mtDNA, and 0. 195 to 0. 247 for microsatellite DNA in G. galeus. However, {{there was no evidence of}} stock differentiation among New Zealand/Australian sample sites for either mtDNA or microsatellite DNA data. These results support the model of a single panmictic stock across the Tasman Sea. The similarity of the results obtained from the maternally inherited mtDNA and biparental inherited microsatellite loci did not support the suggestion of sex-biased dispersal of G. galeus in the New Zealand/Australia region and it was concluded that females and males had similar patterns of dispersal. Sharks can be either monogamous or polygamous, which is important when considering stock assessments and harvesting models. Multiple paternity has been reported in several shark species, however, the number of sires per litter varies considerably among species. An investigation of multiple paternity (MP) was conducted in G. galeus by assessing the levels of relatedness within progeny arrays using six polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers. Five âfamiliesâ (mother and litters) were sampled from the North Island of New Zealand and a parentage analysis was conducted. The minimum number of males contributing to each progeny array was estimated by identifying the putative paternal alleles by allele counting and reconstructing multilocus genotypes method. The analysis showed the occurrence of genetic polyandry in G. galeus; two of five litters showing multiple sires involved in the progeny arrays (40 %). The minimum number of sires per litter ranged from one to four. Although MP was only detected in two litters, this finding is consistent with the known reproductive characteristics of G. galeus. It can potentially store sperm for long periods of time and has a specific mating season when males and females typically mix on the edge of the continental shelf. Detecting MP within a litter has highlighted the importance of the post-copulatory selective processes in the G. galeus mating system, and this has implications for the management and conservation of genetic diversity...|$|R
