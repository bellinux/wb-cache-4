60|$|An {{exposition}} of mercantilism {{would not be}} complete without a statement of the form it assumed in France {{under the guidance of}} Colbert,(14) the great minister of Louis XIV, from 1661 to 1683. In order to create a favorable balance of trade, he devoted himself to fostering home productions, by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country, and by an extraordinary system of supervision in manufacturing establishments (which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which France has never since been able to free herself). Processes were borrowed from England, Germany, and Sweden, and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up; even the sizes of fabrics were regulated by Colbert, and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed. In 1671 wool-dyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used. Long after, French industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes. His system, however, naturally resulted in a series of <b>tariff</b> <b>measures</b> (in 1664 and 1667). Moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on, followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods. The shipment of coin was forbidden; but Colbert’s criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade. French agriculture was overlooked. The tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy French wines, lace, and wheat; that the French could sell, but not buy; but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for French goods, and Portuguese wines came into the market. England and Holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from France. The wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined, and the rural population came to the verge of starvation. Colbert’s last years were full of misfortune and disappointment; and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1830s and early 1840s, the {{agricultural}} communities of south Wales were in dire poverty. In 1837 and 1838 {{the whole country}} suffered from poor harvests, worse in the south west, where atrocious seasons of rain forced farmers to buy corn at famine prices to feed themselves, their animals and their families, which further eroded what little capital they had. Grain harvests collapsed, but the price of butter between 1837 and 1841, and sheep between 1839 and 1841, was relatively high, and even the low cattle prices of 1839 recovered by 1841. But by 1842 a general fall in prices occurred throughout the agricultural markets that continued into 1843. Cattle prices slumped sharply in 1842, and the blame {{was placed on the}} Government, and in particular Robert Peel's <b>tariff</b> <b>measures</b> which eased importation of foreign cattle and meat. In 1842, the harvest {{was one of the most}} successful in years, and that, combined with the contraction in demand from the Glamorgan ironworks, led to a slump in corn prices. The farmers' economic position had therefore shifted from that of dire grain harvests with life supported by sheep and butter sales, to one where the price of their corn, when the weather was favourable, was very low. The diminution of the Glamorgan ironworks, coupled with the new tariff, also had an adverse effect on the prices of butter, cheese, pigs, horses, sheep and lean cattle, impacting harshly on the Welsh pastoral farmer.|$|E

In fact the former are large producers of greenhouse gases, while the latter are more environmentally friendly means of transport in climate.

After an inventory description of these measures, a gravity model is estimated {{and the impact of}} non-tariff measures (NTMs) on agro-food exports from developing countries assessed. Results indicate substantial differences in the structure and distribution of NTMs at the US and EU borders. Technical requirements on quality product attributes have a detrimental impact on agro-food imports in the EU from developing country, while in the US, a trade creation effect dominates. US and EU no-tec NTMs have a negative impact at both borders. However, the estimated effect of the EU measures is more severe than the one at the US border. Looking at specific agro-food products, NTMs penalize meat products, cereals and their derivates, and vegetables and fruits, more than others. The differences in the effects of NTMs on agro-food trade flows at the two borders suggest that developing countries would greatly benefit from bilateral negotiations rather than from multilateral agreements...|$|E
