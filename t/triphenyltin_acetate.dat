40|$|To {{perform a}} better {{investigation}} of the toxic activity of <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) already described in vivo, primary cultures of murine thymocytes were incubated for 2 to 32 h with graded amounts (0. 5 - 8 microM) of the triorganotin compound. The cytotoxic activity has been evaluated with the Trypan blue dye exclusion test, the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl-thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for cell survival and the cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. Following 2 h of incubation with TPTA, a dose-dependent reduction (P < 0. 05) of cellular viability occurred and marked increases (P < 0. 05) of the MTT cytotoxic index and of lactate dehydrogenase leakage were also observed.

Applying the more quantitative plate count and optical density tests on compounds 1 - 3, it was shown that their inhibitory activity ranked in the order 2 > 3 > 1. Significantly, 3 caused around 90 % inhibition of both Eschechia coli (-) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-) when incubated for 24 h at 37 +/- 1 at the 10. 0 mug/ mL concentration level.

40|$|Organotin(IV) chemistry, with {{particular}} emphasis on solid-state structure and applications of ^ ^ m Sn MBssbauer spectroscopy to structural characterisation, is briefly reviewed. The relevance of structure to the biocidal properties of organotin compounds is also discussed. The results of variable-temperature 119 m Sn MBssbauer spectroscopic (v. t. M. s.) studies {{of a range of}} phenyl- and cyclohexyl-tin compounds are reported and analysed. This technique provides a measure of the vibrational freedom of the tin atoms in a lattice and the results are interpreted in terms of the potential of the technique for distinguishing between monomeric and polymeric lattices and between the different three-dimensional conformations of the polymer chains observed in organotin chemistry. The solid-state structures of the pair of carboxylates <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> and triphenyltin formate have been determined by X-ray diffraction. In both compounds the carboxylates act as bridging groups to form infinite onedimensional polymeric chains with trans-O^SnPh^ geometry at tin. However, in <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate,</b> the carboxylate group, as well as coordinating intermolecularly, also weakly chelates intramolecularly to give a six-coordinate tin atom - an unusual coordination number for a triorganotin compound. The polymeric chains are helical for both compounds, but a detailed consideration of their structures explains the observed significant difference in the v. t. M. s. behaviour of the two compounds. The crystal and molecular structure of dicyclohexylt in dichloride has been solved by X-ray diffraction. The chlorine atoms act as bridging groups linking the molecules intoaone -dimensionalpolymer, the local geometryattin being a severely distortedtrans -R^SnX^ octahedron. The structure substantiates aninitial prediction mode {{on the basis of the}} variable- temperature MBssbauer study of cyclohexyltins. On the basis of v. t.

40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} (OTs) {{are used}} worldwide in industry and in agricultural practice. In Italy, the OT mostly used is the fungicide <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA), although {{in past years}} it has been submitted to revision for occupational and environmental grounds. In the present study, the possible effect of the fungicide on cell proliferation has been investigated, using [(3) H]thymidine incorporation radiometric assay. Mouse thymocytes in primary culture were stimulated for 24 h with T- and B-cell mitogens (concanavalin A, CON A and phytohemagglutinin, PHA or pokeweed mitogen, PWM, respectively). Cultures were then exposed 24 h to 0, 1 and 8 microM TPTA. At the end of incubation, cells were pulsed with methyl-[(3) H]thymidine and harvested for total radioactivity counts after a further 24 h of incubation. An overall dose-dependent significant (P< 0. 05) reduction of proliferative response was observed with all mitogens tested. Interestingly, CON A {{proved to be more}} sensitive (P< 0. 05) to the TPTA toxic effect compared with PWM and PHA. TPTA is cytotoxic to mouse thymocytes in primary culture, particularly towards the mature lymphocytes (CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+)).

Triphenyltin derivatives (TPs), {{including the}} fungicide <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA), are OTs mostly {{used in our}} country. Some OTs were proved to be immunotoxic and in this paper the cytotoxicity, the possible selective activity upon definite lymphocyte subsets {{as well as the}} antiproliferative effect of TPTA was investigated in vitro by using primary cultures of mouse thymocytes. TPTA (5, 10 and 25 microM) was cytotoxic to these cells, as demonstrated by the significant (P< 0. 05) reduction of the cell viability percentage (trypan blue dye exclusion test), the neutral red uptake and the reduction of tetrazolium salts to formazan products (MTT assay). These overt effects were already noticed after 4 h of exposure to TPTA. The fungicide otherwise significantly reduced, after 24 h of incubation, the percentage of mature single positive thymocytes, particularly the CD 4 (+) /CD 8 (-) one. Finally, a significative dose-dependent inhibition of the T-cell mitogen-induced cell proliferation was observed in thymocytes exposed to 1 and 8 microM TPTA.

Microcosm experiments were done to compare the ecological impact of the fungicide <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPT) between test systems with clean or polluted sediments (10 microcosms each). Differences in sediment quality affected {{the structure of the}} aquatic communities that developed in the microcosms. Initially, a faster growth of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was observed on the polluted sediments, which contained not only toxicants but also higher organic matter and nutrient levels. Dynamics of TPT concentrations in the overlying water were very similar between the two types of test system. Higher levels of TPT, however, were found in the sediment compartment of the clean sediment systems containing a smaller macrophyte biomass. TPT was very persistent in the sediments. In both test systems representatives of several taxonomic groups showed clear responses to a single application of TPT, although benthic Nematoda were not affected. Although a few differences in the intensity and/or duration of TPT-related population responses were observed between the two types of test system, the background pollutants in the polluted sediment hardly affected the overall sensitivity of the aquatic community to the additional chemical stressor TPT...|$|E

To assess in vitro possible alterations induced by TPTA exposure, primary cultures of mouse thymocytes were incubated up to 24 h with graded amounts (1 - 12 microM) of the organotin. 2. The cytotoxic activity has been evaluated with the MTT colorimetric assay, the neutral red (NR) assay and the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) cellular release. Cell pellets were fixed with 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde, resin-embedded and ultrathin sections were observed through transmission electron microscopy. 3. After 2 h of incubation, dose-dependent increases of cytotoxicity were observed in thymocytes submitted to MTT and NR tests (up to 41. 43 % and 18. 9 %, respectively), while 22 h later this overt effect on cell viability was noticed merely in cells exposed to 12 microM TPTA. Dose-dependent increases of LDH leakage in the culture medium were observed all throughout the study. 4. Morphological investigations revealed features (chromatin condensation, cell membranes fragmentation and formation of membrane bound apoptotic bodies) suggestive of apoptosis. 5.

40|$|Two organotin pesticides, <b>{{triphenyltin}}</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) and {{triphenyltin hydroxide}} (TPTH), were evaluated {{for their ability}} to induce micronuclei (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in vitro using cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in vivo BALB/c mouse erythrocytes. Both pesticides induced a dose-dependent increase but only TPTH induced a significant increase in MN at the highest dose (150 ng/ml) tested in CHO cells. With adding S 9 microsomal fractions, both pesticides induced a meaningful MN induction at 150 ng/ml and a dose-dependent significant increase in SCE. In vivo MN induction in erythrocytes was conducted by treating BALB/c mice orally or intraperitoneally with these pesticides either in a single or triple treatments. Oral gavage (p. o.) of TPTA resulted in a dose-related significant increase of MN induction in peripheral blood and of TPTH induced a significant increase in micronucleated reticulocyte (MNRETs) only in a single treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of TPTA or TPTH, however, resulted in meaningless random increases in MN though these increases might be attributable to toxic effects. The MNRETs levels in the treatment with both pesticides were independent to the sampling time. This study demonstrated that TPTA and TPTH was potential chromosome mutagens.

40|$|After {{decades of}} pollution, benthic {{communities}} in floodplain lake ecosystems {{are likely to}} be exposed to a diverse assortment of sediment-bound historical toxicants and nutrients as well as pulses of newly discharged or deposited toxicants. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the effects of background sediment pollution on the responses of benthic invertebrates to an experimental toxic shock in a laboratory setting. Sediment from a relatively clean and a historically polluted floodplain lake located along the River Waal, a branch of the River Rhine, The Netherlands, was selected, and the fungicide <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPT) was used as the acute stressor. Juvenile stages of the mayfly Ephoron virgo and the midge Chironomus riparius were chosen as test organisms because of their different response to sediment-bound toxicants and food quantity and quality. Our results demonstrated that the type of sediment had no effect on survival and growth of C. riparius when exposed to sediment-associated TPT and that E. virgo was more affected by sediment-associated TPT on clean sediment than on polluted sediment. For the mayfly, no cumulative response of the historical pollution and the recent toxic shock was observed. This observation is discussed in view of the variable content of organic matter, acting both as food and as sorbent, and leads to the hypothesis that a very strong sequestering of TPT in historically polluted sediment prevents expression of toxic effect...|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{biochemical}} mechanisms of organotin toxicity the effects of oral subchronic exposure (70 d) to <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) on hepatic and renal enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism were investigated in rabbits and lambs. Rabbits were offered a diet fortified with 15, 75 or 150 ppm TPTA, whereas lambs were daily given 1 or 7. 5 mg/kg TPTA. On the whole, rabbits were more susceptible than lambs and in both species hepatic enzymes were affected {{to a greater extent}} than renal enzymes. In rabbit liver, glutathione S-transferase activity toward 1. 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene (DCNB) was enhanced at 15 ppm and depressed at 150 ppm TPTA, whereas selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPX) decreased in a dose-related manner; glyoxalase II (GII) activity increased to the same extent at 15 or 75 ppm TPTA but was unaffected at 150 ppm TPTA. For renal enzyme activities in rabbits, only GPX activity was significantly inhibited at 150 ppm TPTA. The only statistically significant changes in lambs were a fall in both hepatic GST accepting DCNB as substrate at 7. 5 mg/kg and Se-GPX at I or 7. 5 mg/kg TPTA, and an increase in renal GII activity at 7. 5 mg/kg TPTA.

40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to shed light}} on the types of freshwater organism that are sensitive to <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPT) and to compare the laboratory and microcosm sensitivities of the invertebrate community. The responses of a wide array of freshwater taxa (including invertebrates, phytoplankton and macrophytes) from acute laboratory Single Species Tests (SST) were compared with the concentration¿response relationships of aquatic populations in two types of freshwater microcosms. Representatives of several taxonomic groups of invertebrates, and several phytoplankton and vascular plant species proved to be sensitive to TPT, illustrating its diverse modes of toxic action. Statistically calculated ecological risk thresholds (HC 5 values) based on 96 h laboratory EC 50 values for invertebrates were 1. 3 ¿g/l, while these values on the basis of microcosm-Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) for invertebrates in sampling weeks 2 ¿ 8 after TPT treatment ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 6 ¿g/l based on nominal peak concentrations. Responses observed in the microcosms did not differ between system types and sampling dates, indicating that ecological threshold levels are not affected by different community structures including taxa sensitive to TPT. The laboratory-derived invertebrate SSD curve was less sensitive than the curves from the microcosms.

The {{present study was}} undertaken to ascertain whether apoptosis might {{play a role in}} the TPTA toxicity in vitro. Mouse thymocyte primary cultures were exposed to 0, 4 and 8 micromol/L TPTA; methyl prednisolone (1 micromol/L) was used as a positive control. Cell aliquots were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h and the presence of early or late apoptotic phenomena was checked by (a) morphological investigations; (b) spectrophotometric quantification of fragmented DNA and agarose gel electrophoresis; (c) cell flow cytofluorometry, using an annexin V-FITC kit; and (d) detection of in situ apoptosis by a colorimetric detection kit (Titer-Tacs). TPTA cytotoxicity was also evaluated using the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Morphological investigation indicated apoptosis and/or necrosis. After 8 h of incubation, cells exposed to 4 micromol/L TPTA showed an increase in DNA fragmentation (on electrophoresis), which was confirmed by spectrophotometry (p < 0. 05). Flow cytofluorometry pointed out an early (p < 0. 05) increase of annexin V-positive (apoptotic) cells in TPTA-exposed flasks, whereas at least partly contradictory, results were obtained with the Titer-Tacs kit.

40|$|The most {{important}} sources of pollution by triphenyltin (TPT) in marine coastal ecosystems are its employment as a fungicide in agriculture and, {{in association with}} tributyltin, as a biocide in anti-fouling paints. In this study, spermiotoxicity and embryotoxicity (from post-fertilisation to pluteus stage) experiments were carried out to better clarify the ecotoxicological effects of TPT during {{the development of the}} sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Sperm exposed to <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) for 60 minutes showed a significantly reduced capability to fertilise eggs even at the lowest concentration of 0. 1 µg TPTA l- 1. In proportion to increasing concentrations, the percentage of fertilised eggs decreased, falling to 45 % at 10 µg TPTA l- 1, the maximum tested concentration. In embryotoxicity experiments at 48 h post-fertilisation, the length of the pluteus somatic rods was significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) from 1. 5 µg l- 1. Progressive increases in skeletal anomalies were also detected, highly significant (P < 0. 001) at 2 µg l- 1. Embryonic development was greatly slowed at the highest TPT concentrations: embryos never reached the pluteus stage at 5 µg l- 1, and development was blocked at the gastrula stage at 10 µg l- 1. As observed in previous experiments using butyltin compounds, embryotoxic effects on both skeletal deposition and blocked development are presumed to be due to interference of TPT with intracellular calcium homeostasis. Sea urchin gametes are more sensitive to TPT than embryos, this condition emphasising the environmental risk due to TPT contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether subchronic (70 days) oral exposure to moderate to high levels of <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA), an organotin derivative used worldwide, would affect the microsomal hepatic and renal drug-metabolizing enzymes in rabbits and lambs. Rabbits were offered a diet containing 0, 15, 75 or 150 ppm TPTA, while lambs were daily given 0, 1. 5 or 7. 5 mg TPTA per kg bw. The tin content in the liver and kidneys was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In the rabbits' livers, TPTA failed to affect the cytochrome P 450 content, or the oxidative, hydrolytic (carboxylesterase) or conjugative (UDPG-transferase) enzyme activities studied. In contrast, a striking dose-related increase in both P 450 content and carboxylesterase activity (up to 280 %) was detected in the rabbits' kidneys, but the ECOD and EROD activities were respectively unchanged or moderately depressed. None of the enzymes studied showed statistically significant changes in the ovine hepatic or renal subfractions. The results suggest that repeated exposure to TPTA could lead to the induction of a particular P 450 -isoenzyme in rabbit kidneys which is concerned with the metabolism of endogenous compounds (e. g. steroids, prostaglandins, thromboxanes). The lack of significant tissue- and species-related differences in the concentration of tin supports the hypothesis that the changes observed in the rabbits' kidneys may not have been caused solely by the accumulation of the metal in the tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} eleven {{experiments}} dealing with (1) lime application, (2) herbicides, (3) nematicides, (4) varieties, (5) fungicides, (6) sowing date and (7) yield potential, are discussed. Lime was necessary, {{not to create}} a more neutral soil reaction, but to eliminate most of the exchangeable aluminium in the soil. It was necessary to incorporate lime to a depth of 200 mm but not deeper. Cycloate and ethofumesate applied at 3, 7 and 1,O kg ailha respectively allowed the crop to emerge free of weeds. Broadleaf weeds emerged soon afterwards and were controllled with an application of 0, 8 kg ailha desmedipham. The efficacy of cycloate depended on the method of incorporation. Nernaticides applied at very high rates prevented a decline iin the plant population due to Meloidogyne incognita but did not prevent serious losses in sucrose yield. Nematodes in clay soils would, for economic reasons, have to be controlled by cultural means. Varieties designated by the breeders as resistant to Cercospora beticola outyielded those that were not even though their resistance was only partial. Cremona, Kawerita' and AM 2 Hybrid B were noted as the best varieties for Niital. <b>Triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) was the most effective fungicide used against Cercospora leaf spot while benomyl, which had proved effective in the past, was no longer effective againgt the disease.

40|$|Two {{examples}} are considered: (1) The effects-of organotin agricultural fungicides on soil Acarina; (2) The effects of reclamation of intertidal land on overwintering shorebirds at Seal Sands, Teesmouth, The effect of <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> and triphenyltin hydroxide was examined by field experiments {{and the results}} are discussed in relation to the dose level, regime and season of treatment. Numbers of soil Acarina were reduced by both clianicals when applied in autumn at recctmended doses. The Mesostigmata and an abundant Prostigmatid, Ttarsonemus floricolus. were particularly affected and the magnitude of reductions was related to the quantity of chemical applied. Not all species of mites were affected and treatment of half the recommended dose resulted in an increase in seme families, of Prostigmata, Seasonal changes in the abundance of mites are described and compared with the results of studies elsewhere in Britain, Suitable laboratory culturing techniques were devised for small Prostigmatid mites. Reclamation of Seal Sands between 1972 - 74 resulted in a loss of feeding area and reduced feeding time. The effects of reclamation are considered in relation to the overwintering numbers of five waders: Grey Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Curlew (Numenius arauata). Godwit (Limosa lapponica). Redshank (Trinqa tetanus) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and to the Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna). Monthly counts of each species are described and compared with counts in previous winters. Changes in numbers are discussed in relation to progressive reclamation. The relative importance of the reduction in feeding area and feeding time in determining the overwintering numbers after reclamation is considered by examination of: (a) the time spent feeding, and (b) the foraging behaviour and diet. The waders overwintered in lower numbers than previously but Shelduck numbers were unchanged. To satisfy their food requirements. Grey Plovers adapted by feeding at night while the other waders fed on adjacent fields in mid-winter. Shorebirds did not change their diet or foraging behaviour. Reduction in numbers was related to the reduced feeding area and food resources available, but for Dunlins loss in feeding tine was more important...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{effects of the}} organotin (OT) {{compound}} <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA) on cytochrome P- 450 content and functions were investigated in liver microsomes from untreated, phenobarbital (PB) - or beta-naphthoflavone- (betaNAF) pretreated rats. At a concentration of 0. 5 mM, TPTA caused a marked loss in the spectrally detectable content of cytochrome P- 450 up to 27 % of its original value, along {{with an increase in}} the inactive form cytochrome P- 420. Both effects were most pronounced in betaNAF-treated microsomes, which showed a shift in the hemoprotein absorption maximum from 448 nm to 451 nm, but in all cases TPTA failed to affect either cytochrome b 5 or total heme content, or to increase the production of malondialdehyde. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation of microsomal membranes or damage to the heme moiety should be excluded as contributing factors in the hemoprotein loss. TPTA also produced a concentration-related functional inactivation of cytochrome P- 450 that was most pronounced in betaNAF-exposed microsomal preparations, as denoted by a striking reduction in the ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity (IC 50 = 0. 088 mM). In contrast, the activities of cytochrome P- 450 -independent microsomal enzymes such as NADPH cytochrome c reductase and indophenyl acetate esterase (IPA-EST) were not markedly affected even by 0. 5 mM TPTA (- 30 %). As assessed by Lineweaver-Burk plots, the mechanism of inhibition appeared to be noncompetitive for IPA-EST and of mixed type (competitive-noncompetitive) for EROD. Among sulfhydryl-containing compounds, dithiothreitol was considerably more effective than albumin and reduced glutathione in preventing cytochrome P- 450 inactivation and even was able to partially reverse the hemoprotein damage when added after TPTA; glycerol, which is known to protect the hydrophobic environment of cytochrome P- 450, was as effective as albumin. This study indicates that TPTA behaves as an almost specific and powerful in vitro inhibitor of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent monooxygenases, apparently through the interaction with critical sulfhydryl groups of the hemoprotei...|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{toxicity}} {{studies have been}} carried out in rats and guinea-pigs fed diets containing <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate</b> (TPTA), triphenyltin hydroxide (TPTH) or triethyltin hydroxide (TETH) for 90 days at levels ranging from 0 to 50 ppm. The lowest dietary levels found to retard growth in rats and guinea-pigs respectively are as follows: 5 and 10 ppm for TETH; 25 and 5 ppm for TPTA; 50 and 20 ppm for TPTH. An increase in mortality was found in the following groups: rats on 10 ppm or more of TETH; guinea-pigs on 20 and 50 ppm TPTA and on 50 ppm TPTH. In rats and guinea-pigs given TETH, paralysis and pronation of the hindlegs developed. These toxic signs were not found in the TPTA- and TPTH-treated animals. This observation was correlated with the finding that only the TETH-treated animals developed interstitial oedema of the central nervous system. The water content of the brain and spinal cord was increased in rats and guinea-pigs at respective minimum levels of 5 and 10 ppm of TETH and in guinea-pigs on 20 ppm TPTA. In female rats given 50 ppm TPTA or TPTH the water content of the spinal cord was only increased. The changes in organ weights which could be related to the administration of the organotin compounds were confined to an increase of brain weight in rats and guinea-pigs given TETH, and in guinea-pigs given 5 ppm or more of TPTA and a decrease of thymus and/or spleen weights in rats and guinea-pigs receiving TETH. Guinea-pigs given 5 – 20 ppm TPTA or 2 · 5 – 20 ppm TPTH displayed lymphopenia accompanied in a number of animals by histological changes in the lymphopoietic system, viz. atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen was found. This possibly induced a decrease of general resistance, so that a mycotic infection developed in the animals. Hitherto, damage to the central nervous system was considered to be the most sensitive criterion for assessing the toxicity of organotin compounds, but the present work shows that the effect on lymphopoiesis is a more sensitive index of toxic action for triphenyltin compounds...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{glutathione}} S- transferases (GST) {{have been}} studied extensively due to their role in insecticide resistance and oxidative stress. The conjugations of the endogenous or exogenous toxins are catalysed by nucleophilic attack provided by side chains of active residues (Tyr, Ser or Cys) located at position 5 or 6 of the N-terminal of the polypeptide. Delta class Drosophila melanogaster glutathione S- transferases D 3 (DmGSTD 3) has however a truncated N-terminal sequence (15 amino acids) suggesting {{the absence of the}} previously mentioned active residue for catalysis. Our study was to characterise the recombinant GSTD 3 and investigate the role of the amino acid residue associated to catalysis of GSTD 3. DmGSTD 3 gene was cloned into the pET- 30 a and expressed in an Escherichia coli production system. The GSTD 3 protein was purified using an anion exchange chromatography. Substrate specificity test showed that the recombinant protein was only reactive towards 1, chloro- 2, 4 - dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (7. 3807 μmol/min/mg), a common substrate for GSTs, suggesting a possible involvement of other residues in the polypeptide that contribute to the catalysis. No activity was observed with 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene, pnitrophenyl chloride, trans- 2 -octenal, trans- 2 -hexanal, ethacrynic acid, trans- 4 -phenyl- 3 - butene- 2 -one, hexa- 2, 4 -dienal, trans,trans-hepta- 2, 4 -dienal, cumene hyperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 8. 2 and at 25 ° C. GSTD 3 enzymatic activity was inhibited by the addition of triphenyltin hydroxide whereas; no difference in activity was detected in the presence of other inhibitors like quercetin, trans- chalcone, tetradecanedioic acid, sebacid acid and <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>acetate.</b> Homology modelling reveals that the side chains of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 were facing towards the substrate cavity, proposing their possible role in catalyzing the conjugation. The potential Tyr residues were mutated to alanine via side directed mutagenesis. Specific activity towards CDNB lowered to half when the Tyr 89 (3. 51 μmol/min/mg) and Tyr 97 (3. 01 μmol/min/mg) were mutated individually. GSTD 3 with Y 97 A and Y 89 A gave large changes in Km, Vmax, and Km/Kcat values for GSH as compared to unmutated GSTD 3 suggesting the significant role of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 in the catalysis of substrate conjugation to GSH in GSTD 3. The study has confirmed the limited detoxification function of GSTD 3 and the importance of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 in GSTD 3 catalysis...|$|E
