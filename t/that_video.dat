5|$|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a {{landmark}} case by the Supreme Court of the United States that {{struck down a}} 2005 California law banning the sale of certain violent video games to children without parental supervision. In a 7–2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and nullified the law, ruling <b>that</b> <b>video</b> games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also wanted to prove <b>that</b> <b>video</b> games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea <b>that</b> <b>video</b> games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of <b>that</b> <b>video,</b> known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

5000|$|Little Baby Bum is most {{commonly}} used {{as a way for}} parents to keep their kids occupied while they get work done around the house. It does this by having one or two hour long compilations of their previous videos. Some parents have complained that this might be bad for a child's development although no proven studies have shown this. They say <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> like LBB's [...] "Ten in the Bed" [...] have taught their children to push other siblings off of the bed. Others say <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> like [...] "Johny Johny" [...] teach their children to lie and expect no punishment.|$|R
5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming <b>that</b> <b>video</b> footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, {{as well as the}} sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned <b>that</b> <b>video</b> reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.|$|E
5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued <b>that</b> <b>video</b> evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{even though}} the {{participants}} indicated {{that the quality of}} the video was high, they also alluded that the size was too large. Almost all the participants suggested <b>that</b> the <b>videos</b> were too large in size. The large size {{can be attributed to the}} (high) quality of the videos. It may be that the students are oblivious of this fact, and may not want to give up the quality of the video for a reduced video size if they are aware. But, majority of the participants perceived <b>that</b> the <b>videos</b> they watched enhanced their learning outcomes. This implies that the students benefited from the videos they watched in relation to the Research Methods course. It suggests <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> are not only an important compliment to traditional classroom teaching, but are actually a means to achieving desired learning goals. The negative perceived outcome of videos can be overcome if the videos could be structured in a way that will also make it a requirement to attend the usual class session. This will eliminate the tendency for students to purposively or intentionally miss class. Also, the fact that most students’ learning approach was enhanced by videos, reinforces the fact <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> are now very critical in the whole learning process. The main advantage for students with regard to their learning approach was <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> greatly assisted them to be more detailed in a convenient way.|$|R
25|$|Cruise also sued Bold Magazine {{publisher}} Michael Davis, who alleged {{but never}} confirmed <b>that</b> he had <b>video</b> <b>that</b> would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped {{in exchange for}} a public statement by Davis <b>that</b> the <b>video</b> was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004 a {{judge in}} Canada ruled <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> seized by the police {{featuring}} BDSM activities were not obscene, and did not constitute violence, but a [...] "normal and acceptable" [...] sexual activity between two consenting adults.|$|R
5|$|In some countries, YouTube is {{completely}} blocked, either {{through a long}} term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to <b>that</b> <b>video</b> in order to restore service. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{uploaded}} to The Movies Online, Lionhead's website for user-created videos, on 22 November 2005 {{and was soon}} covered by American and French press. Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) {{had been used in}} earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right Thing. The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns <b>that</b> <b>video</b> game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of <b>that</b> <b>video.</b> To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5000|$|Some codecs are {{incompatible}} with the current display driver, causing some videos to not play. In addition to this, framebuffer and cache issues mean <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> do play are jumpy {{after the first few}} seconds when the cache is full.|$|R
50|$|The program airs a {{playlist}} of {{the most}} well-known songs in the mainstream. The order <b>that</b> the <b>videos</b> are played goes from No. 20 to No. 1, although only about 10-12 of those videos are actually played. Most of the <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> go unplayed are older <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> are fading off the chart, or less popular <b>videos.</b> A <b>video</b> <b>that</b> is moving down the chart or {{is in the same}} spot as that previous week will in general not get played. Every video debuting on the chart is played. A music <b>video</b> <b>that</b> reaches the No. 1 spot usually stays there for 1-2 weeks.|$|R
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said <b>that</b> the <b>videos</b> {{originated}} from {{the question of}} the film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided <b>that</b> creating <b>videos</b> with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also said <b>that</b> the <b>videos</b> needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|R
5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} <b>that</b> <b>video</b> game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design. The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme. The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two joysticks for movement and attacking.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 <b>that</b> <b>video</b> lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E

5000|$|Australias Funniest Home Video Show premiered in 1990, and {{was similar}} in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) Americas Funniest Home Videos: viewers would send in amateur-shot <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the [...] "funniest" [...] by the studio {{audience}} was awarded a prize {{at the end of}} the show. The producers often received racy or risqué <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> couldnt be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature; however, since the shows policy stated <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> sent in by viewers couldnt be sent back, <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> didnt make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience.|$|R
50|$|Other {{issues can}} relate to the {{practical}} appropriateness of videos in specific projects. This takes into consideration both the project design and the field situation (i.e. the physical environment). Schaeffer concludes <b>that</b> <b>videos</b> can be useful and reliable {{in a variety of}} settings when they are properly maintained and handled.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, Villanova professor, Patrick M. Markey, {{conducted}} a study with 118 teenagers suggesting <b>that</b> <b>video</b> games have no influence on increased aggression of users; however, he did find that when used for {{the right amount of}} time (roughly 1 hour) video games came make children nicer and more socially interactive. This information was provided by the teens teachers at their local schools.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} claim <b>that</b> <b>video</b> games, {{more than}} causing no harm, are beneficial {{to social and}} cognitive development and psychological well-being. Certain scholars admit that games can be addictive, and part of their research explores how games connect to the reward circuits of the human brain. But they recognize the cognitive benefits of playing video games: pattern recognition, system thinking, and patience.|$|E
