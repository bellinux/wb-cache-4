To study {{the effect of}} porosity on the thermal shock resistance systematically, porous alumina with different porosities was fabricated, and the thermal shock resistance of the fabricated samples {{as well as the}} porous capillary was estimated by the infrared radiation heating method. The mechanical and thermal properties concerned to the thermal shock resistance were also measured and the effect of the porosity on the properties was carefully examined. The fracture strength was not changed with temperature, but decreased with the porosity. The fracture toughness, Youngs modulus and thermal conductivity were also decreased with porosity. Thermal shock resistance of porous alumina was estimated quantitively by the experimental thermal shock parameters, <b>thermal</b> shock <b>strength,</b> R 1 c and thermal shock fracture toughness, R 2 c.

30|$|Bimetallic lined {{steel pipe}} (LSP) {{is a new}} anti-corrosion technology. It is widely used to {{transport}} oil, gas, water and corrosive liquid chemicals. At present, the hydroforming pressure for LSP has been investigated theoretically and experimentally by most researchers. However, {{there are a few}} reports on the <b>thermal</b> <b>strength</b> of bimetallic LSP. Actually, the bimetallic LSP will be subjected to remarkable thermal load in the process of three layer polyethylene (3 PE) external coating. Reverse yielding failure may occur on the inner pipe of the bimetallic LSP when it suffers from remarkable thermal load and residual contact pressure simultaneously. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the thermal load and strength of the bimetallic LSP. A mechanical model, which can estimate the <b>thermal</b> <b>strength</b> of the bimetallic LSP, was established based on the elastic theory and the manufacture of the bimetallic LSP. Based on the model, the correlation between the <b>thermal</b> <b>strength</b> of the bimetallic LSP and residual contact pressure and wall thickness of the inner pipe was obtained. Reverse yielding experiments were performed on the LSP (NT 80 SS- 316 L) under different thermal loads. Experiment results are consistent with calculated results from the theoretical model. The experimental and simulation results may provide powerful guidance for the bimetallic LSP production and use.|$|E

The panels have {{three types of}} face-sheet geometry: Flat face sheet, microdented face sheet, and microbulged face sheet. The metal-matrix composite panels have three types of face-sheet layups, {{each of which is}} combined with various types of hat composite layups. Finite-element method was used in the eigenvalue extractions for both mechanical and thermal buckling. The thermal buckling analysis required both eigenvalue and material property iterations. Graphical methods of the dual iterations are shown. The mechanical and <b>thermal</b> buckling <b>strengths</b> of the hat-stiffened panels with different face-sheet geometry are compared. It was found that by just microdenting or microbulging of the face sheet, the axial, shear, and <b>thermal</b> buckling <b>strengths</b> of both types of hat-stiffened panels could be enhanced considerably. This effect is more conspicuous for the monolithic panels. For the metal-matrix composite panels, the effect of fiber orientations on the panel buckling strengths was investigated in great detail, and various composite layup combinations offering, high panel buckling strengths are presented. The axial buckling strength of the metal-matrix panel was sensitive to the change of hat fiber orientation.

However, in some applications, {{they are exposed}} to very high temperatures and high heat-flux environments, and are also subjected to repeated thermal loadings that change rapidly with time.

The thermal shock fatigue experiments were done using a CO_ 2 laser, and the crack generation of the specimens was measured from AE (acoustic emission) signals. Consequently, the <b>thermal</b> shock fatigue <b>strength</b> of MACOR was estimated from the critical power density, and it was proposed that the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>strength</b> of ceramics should be cstimated using a minimum value P_ [W/mm^ 2] of the critical power density below which ceramic fracture is independent of the spot diameter.

The changes of piston crown structure include increasing the depth of shaker cooling hole and blending edges in cooling oil chamber.

Based on temperature field, <b>thermal</b> <b>strength,</b> mechanical strength and coupled strength are obtained in ANSYS. In original design structure of piston crown, the maximum stress is 694 MPa under thermal load, 210 MPa under mechanical load and 677 MPa under coupled loads.

The strength meets design requirement which the maximum stress {{is less than the}} material's yield strength. With increasing the depth of cooling holes, the maximum temperature, maximum thermal stress and maximum coupled stress are reduced.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{subjected}} to severe thermal shocks a functionally graded ceramic (FGC) suffers strength degradation {{due to the}} thermally-induced damages in the material. Multiple surface cracking has been observed {{as one of the}} dominant defects/damages affecting the thermal shock behavior of ceramics. This paper presents a thermo-fracture mechanics model to investigate the <b>thermal</b> shock residual <b>strength</b> behavior of elastically homogeneous but thermally graded FGCs undergoing multiple surface cracking. We consider an FGC plate with an array of parallel edge cracks at the thermally shocked surface. A Fourier transform/superposition method is used to derive the singular integral equation of the thermal shock crack problem. The critical thermal shock that causes crack propagation and thermal shock damage are determined using linear elastic fracture mechanics. The <b>thermal</b> shock residual <b>strength</b> of the FGC as a function of thermal shock severity and crack density (crack spacing) is subsequently evaluated. Numerical calculations are carried out for two FGC materials, i. e., Al 2 O 3 /Si 3 N 4 and TiC/SiC FGCs, to illustrate the effects of crack density (crack spacing) and material gradation on the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>strength</b> behavior of FGCs. It is found that a higher crack density (lower crack spacing) together with appropriately graded material properties significantly enhances the residual strength of the thermally shocked FGCs...|$|R
