40|$|A direct digital {{frequency}} synthesizer (DDFS) using an analog-sine-mapping technique {{is presented in}} a 0. 35 -mu m SiGe BiCMOS process. We intend to apply the translinear principle to develop a triangle-to-sine converter (TSC) that can achieve outputs with low harmonic content. The TSC is introduced for the DDFS to <b>translate</b> <b>phase</b> data to sine wave. Using this analog-interpolating technique, the DDFS, with 9 bits of phase resolution and 8 bits of amplitude resolution, can achieve operation at 5 -GHz clock frequency and can further reduce power consumption and die area. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the DDFS is better than 48 dBc at low synthesized frequencies, decreasing to 45. 7 dBc worst case at the Nyquist synthesized frequency for output frequency band (0 - 2. 5 GHz). The DDFS consumes 460 mW at a 3. 3 -V supply and achieves a high power efficiency figure of merit (FOM) of 10. 87 GHz/W. The chip occupies 1. 5 x 1. 4 mm(2) ...|$|E
40|$|For the {{computer}} Zebra we have undertaken {{a project of}} con-structing an Algol translator {{with the aim of}} being as complete as possible (with the only exception of own variable arrays). As a few new concepts are used in this design, it is thought to be useful to communicate them in this form. Zebra is a two address machine with a very limited fast store and a reasonable drum store of 8192 words. The operation code is a rather peculiar one. Every bit of the 15 bits of the function part of an instruction is used separately for a different elemen-tary function. The operations are in fact micro-operations and more complicated actions such as multiplication, division, list searching, etc. are not built in functions but can be readily pro-grammed. This makes the code extremely powerful for just those operations which are required for an Algol translator. On the other hand it is not the appropriate object language for Algol. Therefore we decided to create a new object language within the machine which is used interpretatively. The structure of this object language (called Intermediate Code or IC) is fully adapted to the requirements of Algol. The analytic code of Zebra helps a great deal in making the interpreter fast and c 0. npact. Another reason why an interpretive code is not such a drawback is that the machine has no built-in floating point operations so that these have to be programmed anyway. The system as a whole works on a load-and-go basis. First the translator is put into the machine, into {{the upper end of the}} store and the Algol program is then fed in, translated and built up in the lower part of the store. Then the interpreter over-writes the translator and the program can start working. We shall distinguish these phases by the names <b>translate</b> <b>phase</b> ~nd run phase...|$|E

40|$|Transferring {{data from}} one {{geographic}} information system (GIS) to another is difficult because of the diverse, and often complex, structure of transfer file formats. Accordingly, the design and implementation of an interface for transferring data from one format to another is time consuming and difficult. The translation may be performed by an interface constructed for the two formats (the individual interfacing strategy), by two interfaces through an interchange format (the interchange format interfacing strategy), or {{by a number of}} interfaces through a series of formats (the ring interfacing strategy). The interchange format interfacing strategy is widely adopted because it offers an acceptable compromise between the quality of the data translation and number of interfaces required. In contrast, the individual interfacing strategy achieves the best quality of translation but is generally rejected because of the impracticality of constructing a large number of interfaces. The goal pursued in this thesis is to maximise the quality of the translation by overcoming the impracticality of the individual interfacing strategy. This is achieved in the following way. An interface is divided into three phases: the decode phase, in which the source format decoder places data from the source format into a relational data base; the <b>translate</b> <b>phase,</b> in which the data is restructured according to a translation algorithm written in a relational query language; and the encode phase, in which the target format encoder places data from the relational data base into the target format. The time and effort involved in implementing these phases of data translation is minimised {{with the assistance of the}} following software tools: parser generators and lexical analysers which are used for generating format decoders; a relational data base management system which is used for implementing translation algorithms; and an encoder generator which is used for generating format encoders. The encoder generator is a new tool developed in this thesis. The efficacy of these tools is demonstrated, and a significant reduction in the effort of constructing interfaces is achieved, making the individual interfacing strategy a practical approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a closed loop adaptive optics system may in principle be improved by selecting distinct and independently optimized control bandwidths for separate components, or modes, of the wave front distortion profile. In this paper we outline a method for synthesizing and optimizing a multi-bandwidth adaptive optics control system from performance estimates previously derived for single-bandwidth control systems operating over a range of bandwidths. Numerical results are presented for {{the case of an}} atmospheric turbulence profile consisting of a single <b>translating</b> <b>phase</b> screen with Kolmogorov statistics, a Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor with 8 subapertures across the aperture of the telescope, and a continuous facesheet deformable mirror with actuators conjugate to the corners of the wave front sensor subapertures. The use of multiple control bandwidths significantly relaxes the wave front sensor noise level allowed for the adaptive optics system to operate near the performance limit imposed by fitting error. Nearly all of this reduction is already achieved {{through the use of a}} control system utilizing only two distinct bandwidths, one of which is the zero bandwidth. ...|$|R

Due to their inherent failsafe characteristics, ARA's are particularly attractive for microwave power transmission from solar power satellites. Communication satellites and deep space probes are other possible applications.

The {{results of the study}} were validated in a model-scale test at NASA Glenn last summer. The findings of that study and test, along with other studies, have resulted in a new strategy for achieving the Commercial Supersonic Technologys goals for noise and performance. Key to that strategy is moving the propulsion to the top-side of the vehicle and modifying the nozzle and inlet to maximally shield the propulsion noise while maintaining efficient operation.

The latter is a new path algorithm based on Fisher information theory, which combines the phase derivative with the expected variance to get a more robust path, potentially performing better than others {{in the case of}} low image quality. In order to compare only the performance of the paths, the same unwrapping function (phase derivative integral) is used.

This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, {{the second and third}} cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. Violin Phase, also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. Piano Phase and Violin Phase both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.|$|R

Placental growth factor was evaluated at baseline and study week 4 (after 3 weeks treatment) in an exploratory analysis of data from a randomized phase 2 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and in a prespecified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel vs placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (MONET 1). Associations between fold-change from baseline in placental growth factor and overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. In the phase 2 study, serum placental growth factor increased from baseline a mean 2. 8 -fold at study week 4. Patients with ≥ 2. 2 -fold change from baseline in placental growth factor (n =  18) had significantly longer overall survival than those with < 2. 2 -fold change (n =  19; 22. 9 vs 7. 9 months; hazard ratio, 0. 30; 95 % CI, 0. 12 - 0. 74; P =  0. 009). Consequently, placental growth factor was investigated as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the phase 3 MONET 1 study. There was no association between log-transformed placental growth factor fold-change from baseline to week 4 (continuous variable) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0. 98; 95 % CI, 0. 79 - 1. 22; P =  0. 868).

50|$|Differential fringes {{which remain}} as fringes in the {{differential}} interferogram {{are a result}} of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite look direction causes an increase in path (<b>translating</b> to <b>phase)</b> difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in differential interferometry one fringe cycle − to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring subsidence movement, slope stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR.
