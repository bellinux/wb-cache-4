5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them,</b> {{they sat in the}} stores for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them.</b> The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them</b> without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E

Homicide detectives became suspicious after questioning Bissonette’s father who states he saw Vermilya sprinkling “white pepper” over their meals prior <b>to</b> <b>serving</b> <b>them.</b> This led the Chicago Police Department to do an autopsy on Bissonette’s body revealing arsenic poisoning. Vermilya {{was taken into custody}} soon after its discovery.|$|R
25|$|Ancient Egyptian {{retainer}} {{sacrifice is}} a type of human sacrifice in which pharaohs and occasionally other high court nobility would have servants killed after the pharaohs' deaths to continue <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them</b> in the afterlife. In Egypt, retainer sacrifice only existed during the First Dynasty, from about 3100 BC to 2900 BC, slowly dwindling, and eventually dying out.|$|E

25|$|Australian {{librarian}} Karen McQuigg {{states that}} “even ten years ago, when I {{was involved in}} a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, {{it seemed as if the}} gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them</b> effectively.” There was a dearth of information for or about the Deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the mid 19th century, {{shipbuilding}} on the Bay of Fundy shore, on the Petitcodiac River, at Chatham on the Miramichi River, and at Bathurst in the Bay of Chaleur, {{became a}} dominant industry in New Brunswick. The Marco Polo, a clipper ship holding the round-trip speed record between Liverpool and Australia, was launched from Saint John in 1851. The Cunard family began to flourish here at that time. Resource-based {{industries such as}} logging and farming were also important components of the New Brunswick economy during this time and railways were constructed throughout the province <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them</b> and link the rural communities.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 {{construction}} {{began on}} what was then known as the Hutt Valley Branch, leaving the main line just north of Petone station and running east to Waterloo, opening on 26 May 1927. After World War II, new state housing suburbs developed north of Waterloo, and the railway was extended <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them.</b> In 1954 it re-joined the western line south of Manor Park and superseded the old route. On 1 March 1954 the former Hutt Valley Branch {{became part of the}} Wairarapa Line and the western route was truncated into the Melling Branch from Petone.|$|E

25|$|New York's Hungarian {{community}} {{reached its}} zenith of almost 125,000 {{in the middle}} of the 20th century, the largest of any city in the nation. The area around the church had a strong Hungarian presence, with many bookstores and restaurants catering to its tastes. It declined over the rest of the century as the descendants of the original immigrants gradually assimilated and moved to Queens or the suburbs. New immigrants attended the church but often settled outside Manhattan as the area had begun to gentrify. The church continues <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them,</b> holding services in Hungarian every Sunday.|$|E
25|$|The first {{travelers}} on Route 66 {{appeared in}} Albuquerque in 1926, and before long, dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops had sprung {{up along the}} roadside <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them.</b> Route 66 originally ran through the city on a north-south alignment along Fourth Street, but in 1937 it was realigned along Central Avenue, a more direct east-west route. The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades. The majority of the surviving structures from the Route 66 era are on Central, though {{there are also some}} on Fourth. Signs between Bernalillo and Los Lunas along the old route now have brown, historical highway markers denoting it as Pre-1937 Route 66.|$|E
25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them</b> quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E
50|$|The Sevashrama {{which started}} {{modestly}} {{over the years}} developed into a full-fledged hospital with many different sections and departments.

Because of financial constraints, {{they had to do}} even the menial work of cleaning the hospital and patients and for this they were looked down upon by the local monks. However this was eradicated through the efforts of Dhanraj Giri, the influential head of Kailash Ashrama, who knew Vivekananda and had great respect for him.|$|R

25|$|On {{the day of}} the Irish general election, 1918, the Camlough Company of the Irish Volunteers {{travelled}} {{by train}} from Newry to Carlingford. On arrival, they found large numbers of Carlingford inhabitants wearing Union Jacks. The Volunteers ordered all the Royal Irish Constabulary men they saw on duty on the streets or at the polling booths to return to their barracks and to remain in them whilst the Volunteers were in Carlingford. A series of attacks were made on the Volunteers from by mobs on the streets. The Volunteers took control and sought to protect voters going to record their votes until the polling booths closed. Seamus Lyang from Dundalk was polling clerk in Carlingford and when the booths closed the Volunteers had to take Lyang under their protection and escort him out of the Carlingford. All the pubs and shops in Carlingford were hostile to the Volunteers and refused <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>them.</b> After the closing of the poll, the Volunteers marched back to Camlough.|$|E
