5|$|There were {{charges of}} vote fraud in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to {{consider}} contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States {{in the eyes}} of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests. At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was born}} in Yorba Linda, California. After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 {{to work for the}} federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president – at 40, the second-youngest vice president in history. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.|$|E
25|$|An automixer, or {{automatic}} microphone mixer, is a {{live sound}} mixing device that automatically reduces {{the strength of}} a microphone's audio signal when it is not being used. Automixers lower <b>the</b> <b>hiss,</b> rumble, reverberation and other extraneous noise that occur when several microphones operate simultaneously. They may also be used to mix sound from non-microphone signals such as playback devices.|$|E

It is {{performed}} in the key of F minor at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. There is a very faint count-off {{at the beginning of}} the track with lots of hiss which appears on the album version, but is trimmed from the single version. <b>The</b> <b>hiss</b> is feedback from an echo unit.|$|E
25|$|The firm {{changed its}} name briefly to Pressman, Witt & Cammer after Lee Pressman joined it in 1948, But Pressman became caught up in <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> Case. HUAC began {{investigating}} Pressman and Witt (also {{a member of the}} group) and the stress began to wear Pressman down, even causing him to become paranoid to a degree. Pressmen left the firm peremptorily in 1949. Testifying again before HUAC in 1950, Pressman named Witt {{as a member of the}} CPUSA and the Ware group. Cammer represented Witt and fellow attorney John Abt before HUAC in the 1950 hearings.|$|E
25|$|I have had, in {{the last}} four years, the advantage, if it be an advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from which the student of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was so thrilling as this: to wait and {{struggle}} among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine—poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all—the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realisation of powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair—all this for seventy minutes by the clock with only four inches of twisted iron work to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one hand—safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.|$|E

500|$|On November 20 in Montgomery, Alabama, Agnew {{reinforced}} {{his earlier}} speech with {{an attack on}} The New York Times and The Washington Post, again originated by Buchanan. Both papers had enthusiastically endorsed Agnew's candidacy for governor in 1966 but had castigated him as unfit for the vice presidency two years later. The Post in particular had been hostile to Nixon since <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> case in the 1940s. Agnew accused the papers of sharing a narrow viewpoint alien to most Americans. Agnew alleged that the newspapers were trying to circumscribe his First Amendment right to speak of what he believed, while demanding unfettered freedom for themselves, and warned, [...] "the day when the network commentators and even the gentlemen of The New York Times enjoyed a form of diplomatic immunity from comment and criticism of what they said is over." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, {{a former}} spy for the Soviets {{and a senior}} editor at Time magazine, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He said that an {{underground}} communist network had been working within the U.S. government since the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with Alger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence. However, Truman did not fully share such opinions. He famously called <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> trial a [...] "red herring," [...] and the Justice Department was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury.|$|E

50|$|Early in production, James Whale {{decided that}} the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to {{represent}} how the story — and horror in general — springs from {{the dark side of}} the imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success at that point. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled <b>the</b> Bride's <b>hissing</b> on <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|R

Tiny Mix Tapes considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s. Rhapsody named the ranked the album 1st on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. PopMatters positioned it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised MF DOOM, who [...] "free-associates culture high and low, from Hemingway to Robh Ruppel, across tongue-tied internal rhymes", and Madlib's [...] "fusion breaks, psych soul, and Steve Reich", and called the album [...] "the best chemistry of either’s career, {{and one of the best}} of hip-hop, period". In 2016 Q listed Madvillainy among the albums that didn't appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that [...] "underground hip-hop's cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF DOOM, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility". Spin ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it [...] "a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles". The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip hop debut albums since Reasonable Doubt. Stylus Magazine ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib's production, based on [...] "an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples", and stating that the album was [...] "displaying the future of hip-hop".|$|E

25|$|To {{properly}} cool a fire, splash {{water on}} all embers, including {{places that are}} not glowing red. Splashing the water is both more effective and efficient in extinguishing the fire.

2500|$|Many of the {{critiques of}} the Venona {{translations}} {{have been based}} on specific cases. [...] The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. [...] Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on <b>the</b> <b>Hiss</b> case. [...] Lowenthal's critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945), in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as [...] "probably Alger Hiss." [...] Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as [...] "a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong." [...] Lowenthal's article led to an extended debates on the 'Ales' message, and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text. Currently Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published.|$|E

(In German reports of the operation, the gas was said to rise above head-height and was illuminated by British flares. British return-fire began and after five minutes, artillery-fire commenced.) Along most of the line, German rifle and machine-gun fire blanketed <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> of gas and smothered the sound of alarm gongs and klaxons. The first warning for many British soldiers was the smell, since with the wind speed and no man's land being only [...] wide in places, the gas arrived without warning. The British donned their helmets and a volley of Very lights revealed the gas cloud.

2500|$|The first radio antenna [...] used to {{identify}} an astronomical radio source was one built by Karl Guthe Jansky, an engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, in [...] 1932. Jansky was assigned the job of identifying sources of static that might interfere with radio telephone service. Jansky's antenna was an array of dipoles and reflectors designed to receive short wave radio signals at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (wavelength about 14.6 meters). It was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to rotate in any direction, earning it the name [...] "Jansky's merry-go-round". [...] It had a diameter of approximately [...] and stood [...] tall. By rotating the antenna, {{the direction of the}} received interfering radio source (static) could be pinpointed. A small shed {{to the side of the}} antenna housed an analog pen-and-paper recording system. After recording signals from all directions for several months, Jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint steady hiss of unknown origin. Jansky finally determined that the [...] "faint hiss" [...] repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. This period is the length of an astronomical sidereal day, the time it takes any [...] "fixed" [...] object located on the celestial sphere to come back to the same location in the sky. Thus Jansky suspected that <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> originated outside of the Solar System, and by comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky concluded that the radiation was coming from the Milky Way Galaxy and was strongest in the direction of the center of the galaxy, in the constellation of Sagittarius.|$|E
