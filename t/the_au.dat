5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E

The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>aux</b> 1 and aux 2 genes enabled the auxin-autonomous growth of BY- 2 cells, but the introduction of the rolABCD genes did not affect the auxin requirement of the BY- 2 cells. The results clearly show that <b>the</b> <b>aux</b> genes are necessary for auxinautotrophic cell division, and that the rolABCD genes are irrelevant in auxin autotrophy...|$|R

President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as <b>the</b> <b>AU</b> lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E

5|$|M-93 {{starts at}} the main gate of Camp Grayling. From there it runs north and east along Sharon Road {{parallel}} to the shore of Lake Margarethe through {{the edge of the}} base complex. The highway continues through forested terrain to a junction with M-72 west of the city of Grayling. M-93 turns east, running concurrently along M-72 into town. As the highway approaches downtown, the landscape becomes more urbanized after crossing <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River. In Grayling, M-93 turns north along the former route of US27, which is now BLI-75. M-72 turns south with BLI-75 along James Street, ending the M-72/M-93 concurrency.|$|E
5|$|The highway passes {{south of}} Wiggins Lake as it {{approaches}} the junction with M-18 in Gladwin.

The highway continues eastward to a junction with M-30 (Meridian Road) in White Star on the west banks of the Smallwood Lake section of the Tittabawassee River. The highway crosses the river and runs through Wooden Shoe Village as it continues through <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable State Forest, crossing extreme northern Bay County. The trunkline crosses into Arenac County before meeting I-75 and US23 in Arenac County near Standish.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} analyse {{and explain the}} role of <b>the</b> African Union (<b>AU)</b> in {{managing}} intra-state conflicts in Africa. It first identifies the key reasons {{for the establishment of}} the African Peace and Security Architecture, namely the failure of the UN and the international community to intervene in remote conflicts in Africa throughout the 1990 s and the reluctance of the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) to interfere {{in the internal affairs of}} sovereign nations. Then, it points to the gap between the optimism of <b>the</b> <b>AU’s</b> founders and its implementation record: in fact, <b>the</b> <b>AU’s</b> capability to stop conflicts in Africa has produced mixed results at best. Focusing on three different case studies – Burundi, Darfur, and Somalia – this thesis unravels the key factors behind <b>the</b> <b>AU’s</b> performance in promoting peace and security. More specifically, it argues that <b>the</b> <b>AU’s</b> effectiveness to achieve its goals is contingent upon four conditions: the internal process, the mandate of the mission, <b>the</b> commitment of <b>AU</b> member states, and external support. By developing this argument, this thesis highlights the importance of both organisational processes and external factors with the view to contributing to the general literature on effectiveness of international and regional organisations in managing intra-state conflicts...|$|R
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, {{in defiance of the}} federal government and <b>the</b> <b>AU.</b> The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|M-33 follows Morenci Avenue {{into the}} center of Mio where the highway joins M-72 south of Mio Pond, and they run {{concurrently}} together across the Mio Pond section of <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River out of town. On {{the north side of the}} river, F-32 merges in from the east and the three roadway designations run concurrently north. The highway continues to a sweeping 90° turn east near Smith Lake. F-32 separates to turn west and M-33/M-72 turns eastward. The trunkline continues to Fairview where M-33 turns north, leaving the M-72 concurrency to continue northward. M-33 crosses into the Mackinaw State Forest and passes through Comins. North of that unincorporated community, the highway curves northeast, east and back north to cross into Montmorency County. Before reaching M-32, M-33 crosses the Thunder Bay River. After the river, M-33 turns westward along M-32 to the community of Atlanta. The highway passes near the Atlanta Municipal Airport as it enters the community. In the middle of town, M-33 turns back north. The highway provides access to the Clear Lake State Park in northern Montmorency County before crossing into Presque Isle County.|$|E
5|$|M-72 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan, running from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan across {{the northern part of}} the Lower Peninsula. The highway connects M-22 in Empire with US Highway 23 (US23) in Harrisville. It is one of only three Michigan state trunklines that cross the Lower Peninsula, shore to shore. In between, M-72 runs across Northern Michigan woodland, agricultural areas of the Leelanau Peninsula near Traverse City, and <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River watershed. The trunkline also provides access to Camp Grayling, a National Guard training facility near the city of the same name. Traffic levels along the highway vary from approximately 800vehicles a day on the east end to over 32,000vehicles near Traverse City.|$|E

5|$|North of this freeway interchange, M-18 is {{also the}} route of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). The {{combined}} BL I-75/M-18 runs north near the Roscommon Conservation Airport and turns northeasterly into town. In the middle of Roscommon, BL I-75 turns northwest along Old 76 Road, and M-18 continues northeasterly across a line of the Lake State Railway. The highway continues independently to the northwest over the South Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River and out of town. It then turns due east along the Roscommon–Crawford county line. This section of the county line also forms the southern boundary of the Huron National Forest. M-18 curves to the northeast off the county line into the national forest territory where it meets F-97 for a second time. At this junction, F-97 merges with M-18 and the two roads run due north to a junction with M-72 west of Luzerne. At this intersection, F-97 continues north and M-18 terminates in rural Crawford County.|$|E
5|$|Oscoda is the {{location}} of the eastern termini of both the River Road National Scenic Byway and County Road F-41. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable River near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into Alcona County. The highway meets the eastern termini of F-30 and M-72 in Greenbush and Harrisville respectively. It also passes Harrisville State Park in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the Mackinaw State Forest. Near Ossineke, the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running along the shoreline of Thunder Bay.|$|E
5|$|The highway turns westward along Wirtz Road {{and past}} the {{southern}} terminus of county road F-97 {{in the northern part}} of Gladwin County. Near a crossing with the Cedar River, M-18 turns north along Bard Road and then west again along Renas Road. The highway returns to its northerly course when it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, cutting across the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County. Through the southern portion of the county, the road runs through the Roscommon forest management unit of <b>the</b> <b>Au</b> Sable State Forest as it approaches Prudenville. In that community, M-18 turns northeasterly and runs along M-55 along the eastern shore of Houghton Lake. The two highways separate on the eastern edge of town, and M-18 turns northward, intersecting the northern end of M-157. M-18 continues north, parallel to Interstate 75 (I-75) near Higgins Lake; M-18 crosses I-75 at exit239 south of Roscommon.|$|E
