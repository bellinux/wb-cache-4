40|$|The {{assessment}} of the structural resistance of historical metal structures involves a depth understanding of many factors, such as {{the properties of the}} constructions materials and the structural behaviour of the connection mode. Available information regarding the behaviour of historical riveted connections is quite limited and more information about the residual strain and stress state is still needed in order to allow the preservation of these existing structures. This paper deals with the {{assessment of}} stress and strain eld which exist around the rivet hole due <b>to</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>riveting</b> process. Experimental specimens were manufactured with riveting technique used in aged metal bridges and different metallic materials for the joined plates were considered. Strain and thermal measurements were done during and after the overall riveting process. The results of the experimental investigation allowed the {{assessment of the}} residual strain state and the thermal response of the riveted joint. The experimental results were then used for validation of a 2 D axisymmetric model. On the basis of the results obtained, the pre-stress state can be evaluated as well as the stress concentration areas where fatigue cracks may initiate. Thus, the provide ndings constitute a supportive tool for further studies regarding the assessment and rehabilita- tion of historical riveted structures...|$|R

40|$|Rivets {{were the}} primary {{fastener}} used to fabricate the connections of steel structures until the mid-twentieth century through a technique called <b>hot</b> <b>riveting.</b> Nowadays, engineers, architects and historic preservationists often lack information on the structural behaviour of steel riveted connections. Given {{the high number of}} parameters induced by <b>hot</b> <b>riveting,</b> the understanding and assessment of the behaviour of steel riveted connections is challenging. Therefore, we reviewed and compared historical test data with the results of experiments we performed. We tested in tension rivets machined from steel connections we fabricated. This paper addresses the impact of the hot-driving process on the strength and ductility of steel rivets. Experimental results corroborate historical test data. Rivet driving increases the tensile strength of steel rivets markedly. However, it reduces their ductility substantially. Consequently, the hot-driving process improves the shear strength of steel riveted connections. Present standards could be refined to account for the impact of the hot-driving process...|$|R

50|$|Such riveted {{structures}} may be {{insufficient to}} resist seismic loading from earthquakes if the structure was not engineered for such forces, {{a common problem}} of older steel bridges. This is because a <b>hot</b> <b>rivet</b> cannot be properly heat treated to add strength and hardness. In the seismic retrofit of such structures it is common practice to remove critical rivets with an oxygen torch, precision ream the hole, then insert a machined and heat treated bolt.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the {{original}} Navajo Bridge began in 1927, and the bridge opened to traffic in 1929. The bridge was {{paid for by the}} nascent Arizona State Highway Commission (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) in cooperation with the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs, as the eastern landing is on the Navajo Nation. The steel spandrel bridge design was constructed by the Kansas City Structural Steel Company. During construction, worker Lane McDaniel died after falling 470 ft to the Colorado River below.

2500|$|The {{solution}} is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of <b>hot</b> <b>rivets</b> nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|R
500|$|In 1974 {{the rock}} singer Alan Price {{released}} [...] the [...] "Jarrow Song", which helped {{to raise awareness}} of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture—"The Spirit of the Crusade" [...] by Graham Ibbeson—in the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley. Perry writes that [...] "In Jarrow, landscape and memory have fused together, just as the red <b>hot</b> <b>rivets</b> once fastened great sheets of steel in Palmer's Yard".|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaintenance {{of ancient}} road and railway {{metallic}} bridges {{has become a}} major concern for governmental agencies in the past few decades. Indeed, since the construction of these structures, between the end of the 19 th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20 th century, traffic conditions have evolved, both in weight and frequency. In the purpose to assess the remaining life of old metallic bridges, some critical structural details have been identified and associated to S-N curves in order to be used in damage estimation (using Palmgren-Miner's rule for cumulative damage, for example). These constructional details are described by design rules of several European and North American standards, such as the Eurocode 3, BS 5400 and AASHTO standards. The particularity of ancient bridges is that <b>hot</b> <b>riveted</b> assemblies, commonly used for their construction, are not represented in most construction standards. Further experiences on the matter by numerous research teams have suggested detail category C 71 from the Eurocode 3 as appropriate. In this paper, experimental data from double shear assemblies manufactures from three different metallic ancient bridges is used to identify, through a statistical analysis, the S-N curves that best fit this constructional detail. Portuguese and French puddled iron bridges were considered...|$|R
