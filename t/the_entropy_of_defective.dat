To this end, we show that if a {{thermodynamic}} system loses its energy only through the black body radiation, its loss <b>of</b> <b>entropy</b> is always 3 / 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emitted radiation.

Thus, <b>the</b> initial low <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe is the fundamental reason why we are here. However, we have a poor understanding <b>of</b> why <b>the</b> initial <b>entropy</b> was low and of the relationship between gravity and entropy. We are also struggling with how to meaningfully define <b>the</b> maximum <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe.
