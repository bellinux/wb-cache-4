25|$|The {{purpose and}} {{benefit of the}} paralysing toxin is not clear. Being arachnids, ticks are related to predatory {{arthropods}} (spiders, scorpions and mites). Spiders and scorpions have retained toxins and developed specialised delivery structures (fangs and telsons) while mites and ticks have lost this feature. Of the 800 species of ticks, 40-64 species (across 10 genera) have been reported as causing a form of toxosis. So as <b>ticks</b> have <b>moved</b> from a predatory existence to a parasitic existence, most species have lost their toxin {{which would have been}} a disadvantage for a parasitic lifestyle (parasites in general do not want to kill their host). Gene sequence of the tick toxin shows high homology to scorpion toxins.|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne {{pathogens}} {{can spread}} easily through {{the movements of}} infested birds. An important example is viruses that {{pose a threat to}} humans and that are carried in Hyalomma <b>ticks</b> that <b>move</b> from Africa into south-western Europe. This study evaluates the probability of arrival of migrating birds from Africa into Spain and the environmental suitability of different regions of Spain for the survival of tick stages introduced by these birds. This evaluation produced a spatial risk index measuring the probability that foreign tick populations will survive in the target area. Periods of highest risk were observed for large areas of Spain, from the second fortnight of April to the second fortnight of May. Although birds may arrive as early as January and massive migrations may take place in March, the environmental suitability for Hyalomma marginatum ticks is low in these periods and high mortality of the spread stages (nymphs) is expected. This study introduces new methods of objective analysis based on spatial and process-driven models for both ticks and hosts and critically evaluates the usefulness of spatial spreading methods for assessing the risk of tick-borne pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Mating system plays a {{determinant}} role in {{the maintenance}} and distribution of genetic variation. Difficulties in applying standard methods of indirect inferences onto parasitic life-cycles partly explain the current lack of knowledge on parasite mating systems. The present study develops a combination of direct and indirect inference methods circumventing such difficulties, and illustrates in particular how such a combination modifies {{our understanding of the}} biology of the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus. To directly assess how females and males pair in natural populations, we sampled 225 mating pairs, genotyped them at six microsatellite loci, and analysed the correlation between mating status and genetic relatedness. This analysis revealed pangamy, i. e. a random association of male and female genotypes. In addition, indirect methods inferred that sib-groups of ticks exploit distinct individual-cows, and hence that <b>ticks</b> probably <b>move</b> among cows during their parasitic lifetime. Altogether, these results negate the expectation of a high frequency of sib-mating, and show the coexistence of genetically diverging stocks within tick cohorts and populations. These results have several consequences for our understanding of R. microplus. For instance, while existing models of pesticide resistance management look perfectly applicable to this species, the epidemiological models of the micropathogens it vectors needs revision. More largely, the methods developed here would help clarify the evolutionary patterns of any dioceous parasite...|$|R
30|$|In {{financial}} markets, a lower tick size, {{which is}} the minimum unit for {{the movement of the}} price of a financial instrument, creates opportunities for identifying arbitrage opportunities (Chordia et al. 2013, Menkveld 2013). This is an essential factor for implementing HFT trading strategies that will create business value (Chlistalla 2011, Comerton-Forde 2012). JPX has embarked on a three-phase move to reduce its tick size, bringing it into line with the tighter increments that exist on Japanese proprietary trading systems, Chi-X Japan and SBI JapanNext (Umeno and Matsubara 2014). In the first phase, JPX initially implemented one-half Japanese yen (JPY) price ticks for TOPIX 100 companies with JPY 3, 000 to JPY 5, 000 share prices. The <b>tick</b> size was <b>moved</b> up to one yen in the second phase, which began in July 2014 (Takeo & Hasegawa 2014). In the third phase, which is scheduled to begin in mid- 2015, JPX will re-examine the appropriateness of the present tick size based on its impact on trading conditions and execution costs.|$|R
40|$|Tick size is an {{important}} aspect of the micro-structural level organization of financial markets. It is the smallest institutionally allowed price increment, has a direct bearing on the bid–ask spread, influences the strategy of trading order placement in electronic markets, affects the price formation mechanism, and appears {{to be related to the}} long-term memory of volatility clustering. In this paper we investigate the impact of tick size on stock returns. Westart with a simple simulation to demonstrate how continuous returns become distorted after confining the price to a discrete grid governed by the <b>tick</b> size. Wethen <b>move</b> on to a novel experimental set-up that combines decimalization pilot programs and crosslisted stocks in New York and Toronto. This allows us to observe a set of stocks traded simultaneously under two different ticks while holding all security-specific characteristics fixed. We then study the normality of the return distributions and carry out fits to the chosen distribution models. Our empirical findings are somewhat mixed and in some cases appear to challenge the simulation results...|$|R

Marshall was reunited with his former manager Paul Lambert, who had managed him at Blackburn during the 2015-16 season. Marshall said: [...] "Wolves is a massive club which looks like it is {{going in the right}} direction... Obviously I have worked under the gaffer as well at Blackburn and we got on well. I enjoyed my time working with him and so getting another opportunity to do that here is something I am really looking forward to. So the <b>move</b> <b>ticked</b> all the boxes and it is something that feels right. It looks like Wolves are going to be strong moving forwards." [...] Wolves then head coach Paul Lambert {{had this to say about}} Marshall: [...] "He is a really good footballer and will be a welcome addition. He will know with the results that are happening that he will have to fight to get in the team. I think the fans will love him." ...|$|R
40|$|Summer-weight {{clothing}} articles impregnated with permethrin {{are available}} as a personal protective measure against human-biting ticks in the United States. However, very few studies have addressed the impact of contact with summer-weight permethrin-treated textiles on tick vigor and behavior. Our aim was to generate new knowledge of how permethrin-treated textiles impact nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks, the primary vectors in the eastern United States of the causative agents of Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis, and human babesiosis. We developed a series of bioassays designed to: (i) clarify whether permethrin-treated textiles impact ticks through non-contact spatial repellency or contact irritancy; (ii) evaluate the ability of ticks to remain in contact with vertically oriented permethrin-treated textiles, mimicking contact with treated clothing on arms or legs; and (iii) determine the impact of timed exposure to permethrin-treated textiles {{on the ability of}} <b>ticks</b> to <b>move</b> and orient toward a human finger stimulus, thus demonstrating normal behavior. Our results indicate that permethrin-treated textiles provide minimal non-contact spatial repellency but strong contact irritancy against ticks, manifesting as a "hot-foot" effect and resulting in ticks actively dislodging from contact with vertically oriented treated textile. Preliminary data suggest that the contact irritancy hot-foot response may be weaker for field-collected nymphs as compared with laboratory-reared nymphs placed upon permethrin-treated textile. We also demonstrate that contact with permethrin-treated textiles negatively impacts the vigor and behavior of nymphal ticks for > 24 h, with outcomes ranging from complete lack of movement to impaired movement and unwillingness of ticks displaying normal movement to ascend onto a human finger. The protective effect of summer-weight permethrin-treated clothing against tick bites merits further study.
