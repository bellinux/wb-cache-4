5|$|Starling and Bayliss's lectures {{had been}} {{infiltrated}} by two Swedish feminists and anti-vivisection activists, Lizzy Lind af Hageby and Leisa Katherine Schartau. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> {{known each other}} since childhood and came from distinguished families. Lind af Hageby, who had attended Cheltenham Ladies College in England, was the granddaughter of a chamberlain to the King of Sweden and daughter of a former chief justice of Sweden. Schartau's father was a Swedish army captain.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} their analysis of {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} 20,055 people found that 4.1% {{of the men}} and 2.6% of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> at least one {{occurrence}} of sexual relations with person of the same sex during their lifetime.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{society was}} a {{traditional}} one and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> no political rights, {{even after the}} Second Constitutional Era in 1908. During {{the early years of}} the Turkish Republic educated women struggled for political rights. One notable female political activist was Nezihe Muhittin who founded the first women's party in June 1923, which however was not legalized because the Republic was not officially declared.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} year, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> to stop {{production}} {{for four months}} {{during the rainy season}} as the rains would prevent the drying of the papads. The next year, they solved the problem by buying a cot and a stove. The papads were kept on the cot and the stove below the cot so that the process of drying could take place in spite of the rains.|$|E
25|$|At one of {{the group}} debates in August 1964, a record 70 women turned up to discuss 'the freedom of dress'. This took place in a room above the Shakespeare's Head in Carnaby Street. Many of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> been objecting to some women wearing the 'butch' attire of a suit and tie to meetings. This {{eventually}} led to long-term social divisions within the group where Butch women became excluded.|$|E

The women's team ceased operations in 2007 due to a dwindling numbers restricting them from fielding a side.|$|E

25|$|Research {{begun in}} the 1970s led to {{clinical}} trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a tetanus toxoid. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> previously had tubal ligations. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s de Beauvoir became {{active in}} France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a {{manifesto}} {{that included a}} list of famous women {{who claimed to have}} had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> not had abortions, including Beauvoir, but given the secrecy surrounding the issue, this cannot be known. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, The New York Times {{reported}} that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was standing up for several women who alleged to have been raped by soldiers during the Atenco incident. It {{reported that}} <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> been silenced for a decade, some jailed {{for about a year}} while others received death threats. 11 women have shown their faces, while several others have anonymously given testimony to the commission. The case investigates then-Governor Enrique Peña Nieto for hiding the incident from the public, and for pardoning the soldiers involved.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, 2017, two 19-year-old college students, Emma Pace and Emily Lang, {{apparently}} fell {{to their}} deaths off a Pacific Crest Trail cliff. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> set up camp {{at the top of}} a waterfall, with a tent and backpacks. It appeared that they lost their footing on the slippery rocks and fell. The two had met in 2008 as students at Laurelhust Elementary in Portland and became best friends. They graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 2016. Each had completed her freshman year--Place at Gonzaga University and Lang at Western Washington University.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} furniture, {{they sat on}} the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and {{employing}} skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> wooden spoons.

25|$|Both Louis and Margaret became {{involved}} in the Tour de Nesle affair towards the end of Philip's reign. In 1314, Margaret, Blanche and Joan—the latter two being the wives of Louis' brothers Charles and Philip, respectively—were arrested on charges of infidelity. Margaret and Blanche were both tried before the French parliament later that year and found guilty. Their alleged lovers were executed, and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> their hair shorn and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Philip stood by his wife Joan, who was ultimately found innocent and released. Margaret would be imprisoned at Chateau Gaillard, where she died.|$|E
