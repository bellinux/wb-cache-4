25|$|MMP-3 {{also does}} {{damage to the}} blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), the {{functional}} equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, after spinal cord injury (SCI). In a similar study conducted using MMP-3 WT and KO mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BSCB permeability, with the WT mice showing greater BSCB permeability than the KO mice after spinal cord injury. The same study also found decreased BSCB permeability when spinal cord tissues were treated with a MMP-3 inhibitor. These {{results suggest that the}} presence of MMP-3 serves to increase BSCB permeability after SCI. The study showed that MMP-3 accomplishes this damage by degrading claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 (another <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein), similar to how MMP-3 damages the BBB.|$|E
25|$|MMP-3 {{has been}} implicated in {{exacerbating}} the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) through its disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Different {{studies have shown that}} after the brain undergoes trauma and inflammation has begun, MMP production in the brain is increased. In a study conducted using MMP-3 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BBB permeability after traumatic injury. The WT mice were shown to have lower claudin-5 and occludin levels than the KO mice after TBI. Claudin and occludin are proteins that are essential for the formation of the tight junctions between the cells of the blood-brain barrier. Tissue from uninjured WT and KO mice brains was also treated with active MMP-3. Both the WT and KO tissues showed a drop in claudin-5, occludin, and laminin-α1 (a basal lamina protein), suggesting that MMP-3 directly destroys <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> and basal lamina proteins.|$|E
25|$|Prior to delamination, {{presumptive}} {{neural crest}} cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing {{the expression of}} the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.|$|E
50|$|Physiological pH {{plays a part}} in the {{selectivity}} of solutes {{passing through}} <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> with most <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> being slightly selective for cations. <b>Tight</b> <b>junctions</b> present in different types of epithelia are selective for solutes of differing size, charge, and polarity.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{implantation}} the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> extended further down the lateral plasma membrane (1 µm) {{and there was a}} significant increase in the cross-linking of the tight junctional strands. At {{the time of}} implantation the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> are electrochemically 'tighter’ and prevent the movement of fluids and electrolytes between the cells. These changes were also found in ovariectomised rats treated with exogenous hormones. Animals treated with oestrogen displayed a picture of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> similar to that seen on day 1 of pregnancy while rats treated with either progesterone alone or in combination with oestrogen had <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> with similar morphology to that seen at the time of implantation. Various components of the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> regulate the selectivity of this paracellular pathway.

40|$|The {{human body}} {{maintains}} maximal {{independence from the}} environment {{by means of a}} highly impermeable continuous cell sheet.

Furthermore, it is clear that <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> are deeply involved in signal transduction and innate immunity. When <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> are disturbed, illnesses such as edema, jaundice or diarrhea will rapidly develop.

40|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>junctions</b> between {{epithelial}} cells {{are believed to}} control the paracellular diffusion of substances across epithelia. Epithelia in which <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> are poorly developed display a high paracellular electrical conductance, while those with extensive <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> show lower conductance values. We describe here a particular epithelium, that of the proximal tubules of the Necturua kidney, in which {{the development of the}} <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> varies in parallel with a change of paracellular electrical conductance. In control conditions, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> between {{epithelial cells}} of the proximal tubules are more developed than in tubules undergoing saline diuresis, a situation which increases the conductance across the paracellular shunt pathway.

50|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>junctions,</b> or zona occludens, are {{the most}} {{important}} cellular element for the formation of semi-permeable barriers within or between tissues. <b>Tight</b> <b>junctions</b> primarily consist of claudins and occludins, which are membrane proteins that form the cell-cell contact, as well as ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, which link <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> to the actin cytoskeleton. However, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> have not been found to be directly linked to stress fibers, like they are for focal adhesions and adherens junctions.|$|R
40|$|Occludin and claudins are tetraspan-transmembrane {{proteins}} in <b>tight</b> <b>junctions.</b> Maculae occludentes, which are less-developed <b>tight</b> <b>junctions,</b> {{occur in the}} granular cell layer of the epidermis. The periderm, which overlies the developing epidermis and functions as a protective layer for the embryo, carries developed <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> as observed in simple epithelia. In both periderm and epidermis, occludin is expressed at the cell–cell border. To determine the difference between <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of periderm and epidermis, claudin- 6 expression was examined in periderm and epidermis. Immunofluorescence staining showed claudin- 6 expression at the cell–cell border of the periderm, {{but not in the}} epidermis. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction confirmed that claudin- 6 was not expressed in mouse adult skin, whereas immunoelectron microscopy revealed that claudin- 6 was localized at <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of the periderm. Furthermore, L fibroblasts with stable expression of exogenous claudin- 6 formed developed <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> at cell–cell borders. These findings indicate that molecular architecture of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of the periderm is {{different from that of the}} maculae occludentes of the epidermis, and that claudin- 6 is important in the formation of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of the periderm...|$|R
50|$|Occludin plays a {{critical}} role in maintaining the barrier properties of a <b>tight</b> <b>junction.</b> Thus, mutation or absence of occludin increases epithelial leakiness which is an important barrier in preventing metastasis of cancer. Loss of occludin or abnormal expression of occludin has been shown to cause increased invasion, reduced adhesion and significantly reduced <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> function in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, patients with metastatic disease displayed significantly lower levels of occludin suggesting that the loss of occludin and thereby loss of <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> integrity is important in metastatic development of breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>junctions</b> are {{intercellular}} junctions {{adjacent to}} the lateral end of the apical membrane. They have two functions: the barrier (or gate) function and the fence function. The barrier function of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> regulates the passage of ions, water, and various macromolecules, even of cancer cells, through paracellular spaces. The barrier function is thus relevant to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood-borne metastasis. The blood-brain barrier exclusively depends on this function of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of endothelial cells. On the other hand, the fence function maintains cell polarity. In other words, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> work as a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane {{with those in the}} lateral membranes. This function is deeply involved in cancer cell biology, in terms of loss of cell polarity. We have been trying to expand our understanding of molecular regulation of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> to human diseases. In this review, we introduce three projects currently ongoing; studies on <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of hepatocytes deeply related to jaundice, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> of endothelial cells crucial for the blood-brain barrier, and the formation and regulation of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> during establishment of cell polarity...|$|R

The mutation and deletion of these proteins impair the functions of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> and cause various human diseases.

40|$|Crohn’s {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} bowel disease that affects the intestinal wall. This wall consists of an epithelial cell layer that forms a continuous polarized monolayer, closely connected by various types of cellular <b>junctions.</b> Among these, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> play a relevant role. They form a continuous structure delimiting the apical and basolateral domains in epithelial and endothelial cells, creating in this way a selective paracellular barrier, fundamental for the homeostasis of the organism. There is increasing evidence that the dysfunction of the epithelial barrier plays {{a central role in}} the physiopathology of Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease patients exhibit a loss of the barrier function of the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions,</b> an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysregulation of the immune system.

5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} has indicated that PKC-α plays a vital role in epithelial tissue, the tissue that covers all external and internal surfaces of the body. Specifically, PKC-α is involved in altering the function of <b>tight</b> <b>junctions.</b> <b>Tight</b> <b>junctions</b> exist at the meeting point between two cells. Here, <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> fuse together to form an impermeable barrier to not only large molecules such as proteins, but also smaller molecules like water. This prevents foreign molecules from entering the cell and helps regulate the internal environment of the cell. Cells infected with certain types of epithelial cancer exhibit increased PKC-α activity. This is a result of a change {{in the shape of the}} cell membrane, particularly in the areas where <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> exists. With greater activity of PKC-α, the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> lose their ability to form a tight barrier. [...] This causes an increased leakiness of the <b>tight</b> <b>junctions</b> and thus movement of molecules into the cells. In intestinal areas, luminal growth factors are able to enter the cell and increase the rate of cell growth. This is thought to be a promotional event that may prolong certain epithelial cancers.|$|R
50|$|Neuroepithelial cells {{give rise}} to radial glial cells early on during {{embryonic}} development. To make the switch, neuroepithelial cells begin downregulating their epithelial features. During neurulation neuroepithelial cells stop expressing occludin, a <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein. Loss of occludin causes a loss of the previous <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> seal which {{is required for the}} generation of nonepithelial cells such as neurons. Another <b>tight</b> <b>junction</b> protein, PAR3, remains at the apical side of the cell co-localizing with N-cadherin and keeps the apical face of the neuroepithelial cell intact. In the absence of occludin some polarity is still lost and the neuroepithelial cell gives rise to the radial glial cell.|$|E

Furthermore, studies in which mice were deprived of occludin expression showed morphological stability in several epithelial tissues but also found chronic inflammation and hyperplasia in the gastric epithelium, calcification in the brain, testicular atrophy, loss of cytoplasmic granules in straited duct cells of salivary gland, and thinning of the compact bone.
