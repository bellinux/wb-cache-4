5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the opposing forces were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E
50|$|The Book of Judges relates that Lehi was {{the site}} on an encampment by a Philistine army, and the {{subsequent}} engagement with the Israelite leader Samson. <b>This</b> <b>encounters</b> is famous for Samsons' use of a donkeys jawbone as a club, and the name Ramath Lehi means Jawbone Hill.|$|R
40|$|A GARCH-type {{model for}} non-leading {{financial}} market returns is considered. The innovation consists in assuming the returns {{to depend on}} the sign of the leading financial market in the world. Under standard assumption, the conditional distribution of the returns {{turns out to be a}} Skew-t random variate. <b>This</b> <b>encounters</b> the possible leptokurtosis and skewness of the returns...|$|R
50|$|After Schliersee {{was raised}} to 'Markt' status in 1919, the town applied for the {{authorisation}} to use the local colours of cornflower blue / gold yellow. However <b>this</b> <b>encountered</b> difficulties, since {{in the opinion of}} the Bavarian State Archives, the main colours of the Schliersee emblem are blue / white and not cornflower blue / gold yellow.|$|R
5|$|An Itza {{account of}} <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> reached the colonial {{authorities}} in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza {{reported that the}} Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered {{to talk to the}} intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujub', Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000–4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during <b>this</b> <b>encounter,</b> the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode and Booker T went on {{to fight}} at Against All Odds, which ended in a double count-out. At TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008, Roode {{defeated}} Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. Sharmell returned after <b>this</b> <b>encounter,</b> resulting in an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 13, 2008 pitting Roode and his new manager Payton Banks against Booker T and Sharmell, which the later team won.|$|E

50|$|In April 1989, Inmos {{was sold}} to SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). Around the same time, work was started on an {{enhanced}} transputer, the T9000. <b>This</b> <b>encountered</b> various technical problems and delays, and was eventually abandoned, signalling {{the end of the}} development of the transputer as a parallel processing platform. However, transputer derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as set-top boxes.|$|R
5|$|According to legend, Boyce {{was lost}} on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout {{came to his}} aid, guiding {{him back to his}} destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, {{explaining}} that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who {{was the head of the}} Boy Scout Association at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.|$|E
5|$|At Final Resolution, {{the team}} of Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks fought {{the team of}} Booker T and Sharmell. The storyline behind <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> {{involved}} Sharmell coming {{to the defense of}} Roode's manager Ms. Brooks, who Roode verbally abused on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds. TNA promoted a match between Booker T and Robert Roode heading into Against All Odds.|$|E
5|$|Following Unbreakable, Raven {{lost the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Jeff Jarrett at a Border City Wrestling event on September15 after {{interference}} by America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and Scott D'Amore {{to win the}} championship. Raven did not receive a rematch for the title. Instead, Jarrett was scheduled to defend the championship against a returning Kevin Nash at Bound for Glory. Nash could not attend the event due to a legitimate medical emergency, with TNA holding a Ten-Man Gauntlet match to find his replacement at the show. Rhino won the match and took Nash's place in the main event. There, Rhino defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhino also competed in a Four Way Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory against Abyss, Jeff Hardy, and Sabu. Rhino was the victor in <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> for several hours afterwards, but he turned in pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.|$|E

Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in <b>this</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|E

5|$|The kakawin text Irawan(an)taka ("Death of Irawan"), {{also known}} as Parthawijaya ("Arjuna's Victory"), {{describes}} Irawan's death in the Bharatayuddha (Mahabharata war).

Kalasrenggi, whose father was killed by Ardjuna, mistakes Irawan for Ardjuna because of the similarity of their appearance and kills him. Arjuna then kills Kalasrenggi to avenge Irawan's death. The death of Irawan is placed {{at the very beginning of}} the war in the Javanese version of the Mahabharata. The puppetry version of the story places <b>this</b> <b>encounter</b> between Irawan and Kalasrenggi even before Irawan's meeting with his father, ahead of the Bharatayuddha.|$|E
5|$|The predominate bout on {{the card}} was for the TNA X Division Championship, in which then-champion A.J. Styles defended the title against the {{challenger}} Petey Williams.

5|$|The {{question}} {{who shot}} down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained {{convinced that they}} were shot down by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos, two Serrate-equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF, participated in the attacks on Magdeburg. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito F.II, DZ303, piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23:15south of Brandenburg. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88with its position lights on. They attacked the Ju 88and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit, {{but they did not}} claim a victory. <b>This</b> <b>encounter</b> exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.|$|E
