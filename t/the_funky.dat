500|$|... "I've Seen All Good People" [...] is a {{suite of}} two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into <b>the</b> <b>funky</b> second movement. [...] The band had {{difficulty}} recording the initial [...] "Your Move" [...] section, which was resolved by making a tape loop of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Portuguese 12-string guitar, miscrediting it as a [...] "vachalia" [...] on the album's credits.

Author James Riordan has noted the song's mention of the [...] "changeling", or spirit child, may be another reference to Morrison's difficult childhood. <b>The</b> <b>funky</b> James Brown-esque composition also appears to anticipate the singer's departure from Los Angeles with the line [...] "I'm leavin' town on the midnight train".|$|E

His accompanying songs to these dances include [...] "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes", [...] "Do the Boogaloo", and [...] "Get on the Good Foot". The song [...] "Do the Boogaloo" [...] influenced Boogaloo Sam when he created the boogaloo dance style, and the Good Foot triggered the creation of breaking.

By contrast, IGN Music criticized Knowles' vocals in the song, writing that she [...] "comes in over the low-end track with too much earnestness, drowning out <b>the</b> <b>funky</b> grooves with her piercing dramatic mezzo-soprano.

Eric Torres of Pitchfork Media named the song [...] "Best New Track" [...] in their review, describing the song as [...] "in-your-face impressive, filled with the kind of lush braggadocio the 24-year-old rapper has cut down to a formula".
