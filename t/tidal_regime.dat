2500|$|Concentrations of PAH in {{river and}} estuarine sediments vary {{according}} {{to a variety of}} factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as <b>tidal</b> <b>regime</b> which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth. Understanding of sediment hosted PAH in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (e.g. mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAH can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism. River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10 to 60cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH. Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163µg/kg (dry weight sediment) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3766µg/kg in the River Mersey. In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural total organic carbon content (TOC) tend to accumulate PAH due to high sorption capacity of organic matter. A similar correspondence between PAH and TOC has also been observed in the sediments of tropical mangroves located on the coast of South China ...|$|E

It is able to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as extreme water regimes. An increase in the reedarea could play an important role in the ‘purification capacity’ of the Scheldt-estuary and thus lead to a decrease in the nitrogenload of the Northsea. Therefore it is necessary to know how reed reacts at different tidal situations. One of the objectives of the SIGMA-plan is the construction of ‘controlled inundation areas’ in which the hydrological characteristics will differ from those in the marshes. Yet, it is expected that in many of these ‘controlled inundation areas’, reed will be a dominant plant species. At the University of Antwerp, a mesocosm experiment will be carried out, in which different <b>tidal</b> <b>regimes</b> are simulated.

Exactly how this is chosen depends on the <b>tidal</b> <b>regime</b> in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tidal</b> <b>regime</b> at the {{entrance}} to Pelorus Sound is typical of New Zealand coastal locations, i.e. there is a semi-diurnal tide modulated on a spring-neap cycle, generated by the superposition of M2 (lunar, semi-diurnal) and S2 (solar, semi-diurnal) tidal constituents. Other tidal constituents, notably N2 (semi-diurnal, generated by the ellipticity of the moon’s orbit), introduce further modulation, meaning that the spring-neap cycle is not exactly repeated. The tidal range varies between 1.0 and 1.3 m at neap and 2.1 and 2.4 m at spring. (These values are calculated from a sea level time series, July 1997 - February 1998, at Pelorus Sound entrance.) The propagation of this tidal signal into Pelorus Sound has not been well described, but models and measurements both suggest that the tidal range within the sound is somewhat larger (by 10-20%) than at {{the entrance}}.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies of {{sedimentation}} on sandy tidal-flats {{have long}} ac-knowledged that tidal flows and waves {{are the most}} influential hydro-dynamic forcing factors operating on surficial sediments. Tidal flows influence the long-term evolution of tidal-flats because of the asym-metry of <b>tidal</b> <b>regimes</b> (flood and ebb). Tidal current activity is mainly confined to channels. Outside the channels, mainly on the upper tidal-flats, tidal current velocities decrease and sediment entrainment is fre-quently ascribed to wave action. The role of wave-induced processes on intertidal-flat sediments is frequently stated but has seldom been investigated, apparently because of methodological constraints. In this paper we report on investigations {{into the role of}} wave pro-cesses in determining surficial sediment distribution patterns on a sandy tidal-flat at Newtownards, at the northern end of Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (spring tidal range 3. 5 m).

Outputs from a hydrodynamic model identified an axis of bedload parting centred on the western Torres Strait islands (~ 142 ° 15 'E).

However, parting is aided by overtides on the eastern, mixed semidiurnal side of the strait. Bedload parting is also strongly impacted by wind-driven currents. Wind-driven currents during the trade wind season lead to the average estimates of bedload transport to be directed west, through the strait, over the 8 year model duration. As a result, east and west directed bedload parting is only active during the monsoon season when the influence of wind-driven circulation is negligible.
