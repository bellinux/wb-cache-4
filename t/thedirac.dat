When {{only one of the}} two sublattices is selectively excited by the probe beams that aremomentum-matched onto <b>theDirac</b> points, a singly-charged optical vortex emerges in the output of the symmetric conical diffraction pattern. Furthermore, flipping of the topological charge is observed as the excitation shifts from sublattice A to sublattice B. On the other hand, when both sublattices are simultaneously excited, the conical diffraction pattern becomes highly asymmetric, accompanied by interesting phenomena related to the generation of half-integer vortices and line singularities. We present four different cases of selective excitation using two different approaches; onewith three input probe beams that are momentum-matched to the threeK valleys, and the otherwith only two probe beamswhile the Bloch modes surrounding the third valley are excited due to Bragg reflection. Our experimental results are confirmed by numerical simulation of the paraxial wave equationwith aHCL potential as well as by theoretical analysis of the two-dimensional Dirac–Weyl equations directly. These studies indicate that the lattice pseudospin is not just amathematical formality, but rather it canmanifest through its angularmomentum transferred to probing optical beams. 1...|$|E
