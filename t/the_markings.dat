5|$|From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was {{in reserve}} at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 25 November She went into reduced commission, {{returning}} to full commission 1 September 1926. In early 1927, Mercy was painted white with no hospital markings, {{but by the time}} of a 1931 visit to Vancouver, <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> had been restored.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. <b>The</b> <b>markings</b> on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E
50|$|The black-breasted {{buttonquail}} is a plump quail-shaped bird of predominantly marbled black, rufous {{and pale}} brown, marked prominently with white spots and stripes, and white eyes. Like other buttonquails, the female is {{larger and more}} distinctively coloured than the male. Measuring up to 20 cm (8 in), it has a black face and chin, sprinkled with fine white <b>markings.</b> <b>The</b> smaller male measures up to 19 cm (7.5 in) and lacks <b>the</b> black <b>markings.</b> <b>The</b> black <b>markings</b> and large size of the female and <b>the</b> dark <b>markings</b> and whitish face of the male distinguish the species from the painted buttonquail.|$|R
50|$|Mulsantina picta {{is a small}} ladybug, {{typically}} 3.3 - 5.3 mm long, and 2.2 - 4.0 mm wide. <b>The</b> elytral <b>markings</b> {{are quite}} variable, and sometimes absent. <b>The</b> pronotal <b>markings</b> are more constant and recognizable.|$|R

5|$|Distinguishing S.grandis {{from the}} other four New World species of Sphecius (S.convallis, S.hogardii, S. speciosus, S.spectabilis) is difficult. The female S.convallis was {{originally}} distinguished from the female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S.convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for S.grandis. However, this {{was found to be}} insufficient for correct identification because the positions of <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> can vary among different wasps of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. <b>The</b> <b>markings</b> are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. <b>The</b> <b>markings</b> on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E

5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. <b>The</b> <b>markings</b> are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. <b>The</b> <b>markings</b> on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of the}} short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the Battle of Britain Bunker, {{including}} the No. 11 Group memorial, will retain the RAF Uxbridge name and be maintained by RAF Northolt as an exclave. The Royal Air Force Ensign {{was moved to the}} area, together with the Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian, a fibreglass replica of aircraft BR600. The Spitfire was refurbished and painted in the D-Day invasion colours of No. 33 Squadron as aircraft BS239, funded by the London Borough of Hillingdon. Uxbridge's first gate guardian was a real Supermarine Spitfire which was unveiled on 23 May 1973. This was sold to a collector for restoration and replaced by the current guardian in 1988. At a service commemorating the Battle of Britain in September 2010, a new Hawker Hurricane gate guardian in <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron was unveiled, also near the bunker. The guardian is a fibreglass replica of the aircraft flown by Witold Urbanowicz during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} markings that criss-cross {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of <b>the</b> <b>markings,</b> reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, but scientists cannot confirm that, because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E

5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new hospital ship was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights. Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and <b>the</b> <b>markings</b> were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E
