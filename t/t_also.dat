5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker <b>T</b> <b>also</b> had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E

25|$|The {{motion is}} periodic, repeating {{itself in a}} {{sinusoidal}} fashion with constant amplitude, A. In addition to its amplitude, the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator is characterized by its period T, {{the time for a}} single oscillation or its frequency f=, the number of cycles per unit time. The position at a given time <b>t</b> <b>also</b> depends on the phase, φ, which determines the starting point on the sine wave. The period and frequency are determined {{by the size of the}} mass m and the force constant k, while the amplitude and phase are determined by the starting position and velocity.|$|E

This was followed, on 2 September, by another shore bombardment of the Montenegrin coast by the Huszár-class destroyers [...] and , assisted by 64 F and 66 F. On 16 September, 68 F and 72 F were involved in a raid and landing at San Giovanni di Medua on the Albanian coast.

500|$|During {{the night}} of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the {{dreadnought}} battleships [...] and [...] At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the harbour defence barrage opened, the dreadnoughts [...] and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including 78 <b>T,</b> <b>also</b> departed Pola and set course for Slano, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with Horthy {{in preparation for a}} coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast, two Royal Italian Navy (...) MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of Luigi Rizzo, MAS 15 fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit Szent István. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on Szent István were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. Szent István capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the November 2015 Paris attacks, German pianist Davide Martello brought a grand piano to the street {{out in front of}} the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and {{performed}} an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went viral. This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why [...] "Imagine" [...] had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, [...] "the plainest and least complicated key, with no sharps or flats" [...] aside from one passage with [...] "a plaintive major seventh chord that allows a tiny bit of E minor into the tonic". That piano part, [...] "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, [...] "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, [...] "remind us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song [...] "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... <b>t</b> <b>also</b> reveals its tenacity".|$|E
