40|$|Cosmic-ray {{secondaries}} and tertiaries {{have been}} studied {{in a series of}} experiments. It has been shown that <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> from lead have little power to produce detectable tertiaries or showers from lead or aluminum. <b>The</b> <b>secondaries</b> from aluminum have been found to produce more showers in lead than <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> from air. <b>The</b> absorption coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> from aluminum {{has been found to be}} 0. 7 cm- 1 Pb and the absorption coefficient of their lead tertiaries 2. 0 cm- 1 Pb. <b>The</b> values for <b>secondaries</b> from air and a heavy roof, and their lead tertiaries were previously found to be 0. 5 cm- 1 Pb and 2. 58 cm - 1 Pb. The values obtained from Rossi's and Funfer's data are 0. 32 cm- 1 Pb for <b>the</b> air <b>secondaries</b> and 1. 18 cm - 1 Pb for their lead tertiaries. It follows that <b>the</b> air <b>secondaries</b> and their lead tertiaries have greater energies than <b>the</b> aluminum <b>secondaries</b> and their lead tertiaries. It has been found that a component of the cosmic rays even softer than the corpuscular component is probably the chief source of <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> producing <b>the</b> showers. There is some evidence that non-ionizing particles produce a portion of the showers and that possibly non-ionizing secondaries are produced in lead and that these particles can produce ionizing particles in aluminum...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and observational progress has substantially improved {{the definition of}} the lower main sequence and established a new basis for a comparison of main sequence stars and <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> in CVs. <b>The</b> evolutionary sequences of Kolb & Baraffe [1999] imply that <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> in many CVs are expanded compared with main sequence stars of the same mass as a consequence of unusually high mass transfer rates and/or pre-CV nuclear evolution. We show that the location of <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> of all well-studied CVs in the spectral type period diagram implies that they are consistent with having near-solar metallicities. We show, furthermore, that the surface brightness of K/M stars depends on gravity and metallicity and present new Barnes-Evans relations valid for dwarfs of near-solar metallicity and <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> in CVs of the galactic disk population. Distances derived by the surface brightness method agree with recent measurements of the trigonometric parallaxes of a few selected systems.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to know the molting sequence and the aging points of flight feathers of steller's sea eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus). For this study, two captive immature steller's sea eagles raised at the Ornithology Laboratory attached to Kyungsung University were surveyed for five years from Nov. 2000 to Nov. 2005. The survey indicated that the first molting began in July of the second year, and the primaries of P 1 - 3, <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> of S 18 - 19 (female), S 17 - 18 (male), and S 1 and S 4 were re-placed by one-time with second generation feathers. Generally molting stopped during the winter pe-riod, but a few feathers continued to molt during the winter. <b>The</b> two <b>secondaries</b> of S 18 - 19 (female) and S 17 - 18 (male) always molted every year but some of <b>the</b> juvenile <b>secondaries</b> (male: S 10, S 11, etc) retained for 2 or 3 years. In the molting order of primaries, the first molting started at P 1 and it pro-ceeded to P 10 of outside. In <b>the</b> <b>secondaries,</b> <b>the</b> first molting started at S 17 (male) and S 19 (female), and it proceeded to outside. After that molting it started at S 1 and proceeded to inside. In <b>the</b> other <b>secondaries,</b> <b>the</b> pattern of molting which proceeded in the mid-part of <b>the</b> <b>secondaries</b> was usually beginning in several different points at the same time.

5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>secondary</b> {{armament}} of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A {{hit from}} a light gun {{could not be}} relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only sure way to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack {{was to provide a}} destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> guns were seen as {{a major part of the}} anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, dual-purpose guns increasingly adopted.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>secondary</b> battery {{consisted}} of twelve 6-inch (15.2cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure.

Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> battery, though {{he retired from the}} post of First Sea Lord in 1910.
