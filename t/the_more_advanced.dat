5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six months}} {{following}} Allied liberation, Belgian towns were widely targeted by the unpiloted German V-Bombs. A total of 2,342 of these rockets (mostly of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> V-2 type) fell in a 10-mile radius around Antwerp alone. A post-war SHAEF report estimated V-Bombs had been responsible for killing 5,000 people and injuring a further 21,000, mostly in the cities of Liège and Antwerp.|$|E

In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{also used}} at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion {{research}} laboratory, {{and it will be}} used in <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Schalke, Holtby was named in the {{starting}} line-up for the 2011 Supercup on 23 July and scored the first penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club the following month, netting Schalke's third in a 5–1 league win over Köln. Having previously played as an attacking fielder and winger, Holtby was converted to a deeper role under new manager Ralf Rangnick due to Spanish legend Raúl occupying <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> attacking position in the team. In spite of his more defensive role, Holtby managed to record a career best tally of nine goals for the season across 41 appearances, helping Schalke finish the campaign in fifth position {{in the league and}} as semi-finalists in the Champions League.|$|E

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced,</b> large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man & Bass debuted on {{the aging}} 16-bit Super Famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with Mega Man 8. Producer Keiji Inafune claimed Mega Man & Bass was created {{with regard to}} younger players who did not yet own one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> gaming systems. The game {{received}} positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though many found the difficulty to be too steep. Although Mega Man & Bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series, the ninth numbered title would not be released until 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA) {{operated}} a substantially modified {{variant of the}} Harrier, the British Aerospace Sea Harrier. The Sea Harrier was not intended for ground-attack duties and, unlike the standard Harrier, was equipped with radar and Sidewinder missiles for air combat duties and fleet air defence. The Sea Harrier was also fitted with navigational aids for carrier landings, modifications to reduce corrosion and a raised bubble-canopy for greater visibility. The aircraft were later equipped to use AIM-120 AMRAAM beyond-visual-range anti-aircraft missiles and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> Blue Vixen radar for longer range air-to-air combat, as well as Sea Eagle missiles for conducting anti-ship missions.|$|E

5|$|Thermal {{power plants}} which use oil shale as a fuel mostly employ {{two types of}} {{combustion}} methods. The traditional method is Pulverized combustion (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> method is Fluidized bed combustion (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC technologies are Bubbling fluidized bed combustion (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC).|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, No.1 AD {{comprised}} 350 staff; {{the overall}} {{strength of the}} RAAF at this time was under 2,000. The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the Westland Wapiti, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Demon, de Havilland Dragon Rapide, Avro Cadet, Avro Anson, and North American NA-16. The NA-16 was later augmented by the purchase of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> North American NA-33, which was licensed and built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation as the CAC Wirraway. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton on 1March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1September 1936. No.1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft fitters and riggers in 1935, leading {{to the formation of}} No.1 School of Technical Training five years later.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E

5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left field line. Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Scottish {{universities}} largely had a Latin curriculum, {{designed for the}} clergy and civil and canon lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new Humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics, and putting a largely unquestioning faith {{in the works of}} Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> degrees that were common amongst European scholars needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, large numbers of Scots continued their studies on the Continent and at English universities. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the Humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493.|$|E

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E
5|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as la Machine Pneumatique (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the air pump invented by the French physicist Denis Papin. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year {{stay at the}} Cape of Good Hope, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer Johann Bode chose <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> double-cylinder version. Lacaille Latinised the name to Antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart. English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The International Astronomical Union adopted {{it as one of}} the 88 modern constellations in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant is a diurnal {{species that}} is active {{throughout}} the day, quickly foraging {{on either the}} ground or vegetation. They are scavengers, predators and seed-eaters, generally having a broad diet of animal material, insects, small arthropods, honeydew from sap-sucking insects and seeds. The workers usually prey on beetles, moths and termites, using their stingers to kill them by injecting venom. The removal of the capitula (structure similar to an elaiosome) from Eurycnema goliath eggs reduces the chances of them being collected by green-head ants that carry them back into their nests. In areas where the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) is dominant, the green-head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are primitive general predators, in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> species (which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones), {{they are unable to}} defend food sources from dominant ants. They rely heavily on any food source, and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants.|$|E
