5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|In August 1932 the {{announced}} Internordic Catholic rally {{finally took}} place in Copenhagen {{in the form of}} a Eucharistic Congress. All five countries were represented. Bishop Smit, who had resigned in 1927, was replaced by Bishop-elect Mgr. Jacques Mangers, S.M. (1889-1972), Vicar of South Norway, that country having in 1931 been divided into three jurisdictions. Among the many foreign dignitaries present for the occasion we find, once more, Cardinal van Rossum (who died only some weeks later) and Cardinal August Hlond of Gniezno and Poznań. It stands <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the busy programme of a Eucharistic Congress did not allow time for a formal Conference meeting.|$|E

If the parties choose to proceed on with the claim without any objections to the judge, it stands <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a court will infer a waiver to the accusation of bias if either party had not raised an objection to bias at the commencement of a suit or at any time during it, following the approach taken by Locabail which was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (2002).|$|E

25|$|Since the {{invention}} of the microscope in the seventeenth century it has been known that plant and animal tissue is composed of cells : the cell was discovered by Robert Hooke. The plant cell wall was easily visible even with these early microscopes but no similar barrier was visible on animal cells, though it stood <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> one must exist. By the mid 19th century, this question was being actively investigated and Moritz Traube noted that this outer layer must be semipermeable to allow transport of ions. Traube had no direct evidence for the composition of this film, though, and incorrectly asserted that it was formed by an interfacial reaction of the cell protoplasm with the extracellular fluid.|$|E
25|$|Creosote {{was first}} {{discovered}} in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, {{when he found}} it both in the tar and in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because pyroligneous acid was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a diluted solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained a smoky flavor. This led him <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in wood tar was also in coal tar, as well as amber tar and animal tar, in the same abundance as in wood tar.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori laws of nature, like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori laws of nature that we know apply to all objects before we experience them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E

500|$|New Super Mario Bros. was {{released}} by Nintendo in North America on May 15, 2006, in Japan on May 25, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. Nintendo did not specify why it chose to delay the game's release in its home market of Japan by ten days, but GameSpot noted that [...] "it stands <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the company simply wants {{a few more days}} to build inventory." [...] In Japan, over 480,000 units of New Super Mario Bros. were sold on the day it {{was released}} and 900,000 copies in the first four days. At the time, it was the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game in Japan, but it has since been surpassed by Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It is Japan's 26th best-selling game in 2008. In the United States, 500,000 copies of New Super Mario Bros. were sold in the first 35 days, and one million copies were sold twelve weeks after its release. Worldwide sales have steadily increased throughout the years, with five million copies by April 2008, eighteen million by March 2009, and 30.8 million by March 2016, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time.|$|E

500|$|Tripp {{wrote in}} the May 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research that Sexual Preference would likely be seen as [...] "a shock and a disappointment", since its authors {{abandoned}} many of Alfred Kinsey's methods and conclusions {{and in some cases}} even misrepresented them. Tripp criticized Bell et al. for ignoring Kinsey's warning to make careful observations and [...] "avoid theory", and for attempting to test the validity of psychoanalytic theories, which he considered already discredited by professionals. While Tripp nevertheless believed that Bell et al. had rendered a valuable service by showing that psychoanalytic theories are unsupported, he rejected their argument that since psychoanalytic ideas are incorrect the origins of sexual orientation must be genetic and hormonal, noting that in order <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> way they had to ignore the work of sex researchers such as Frank Beach. Tripp also accused Bell et al. of citing low quality and unreplicated hormone studies, ignoring evidence relating homosexuality to early puberty, and substituting [...] "inductive for deductive methods". In the same issue, Bell et al. replied to Tripp′s review, accusing him of making false statements about their data analysis, misrepresenting their conclusions, and making [...] "ridiculous criticisms" [...] of the scientific method they had employed. Tripp responded in the November 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research, accusing Bell et al. of making personal attacks, and attempting to refute them on specific points.|$|E

40|$|When we {{say that}} a subject has attitudes that she is rationally {{required}} to have, does that entail that she has those attitudes for reasons? In other words, is there a deep nexus between being rational and responding <b>to</b> <b>reasons?</b> Many have argued that there is. For example, Derek Parfit tells us that 'to be rational is to respond to reasons' (Parfit 1997, p. 99). But I am not so sure. I begin by considering this question {{in the domain of}} theoretical rationality. The question in this domain is whether, when a subject has the beliefs that she is required to have by the norms of theoretical rationality, she is responding <b>to</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> there are for having those beliefs. Armed with a moderately clear answer to this question in the theoretical domain, I consider their relationship in the practical domain. When a subject has the desires that she is required to have by the norms of practical rationality, is she responding <b>to</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> there are for having those desires? Part of the interest of these questions lies in improving our understanding of reasons for action. I will say a little about this towards the end. 1.

2500|$|In {{the line}} 2:1 the book {{refers to the}} fish as dag gadol, [...] "great fish", in the masculine. However, in the 2:2, it changes the gender to daga, meaning female fish.

[...] The peculiarity of this change of gender led the later rabbis <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> this means Jonah was comfortable in the roomy male fish, so he didn't pray, but that God then transferred him to a smaller, female fish, in which the prophet was uncomfortable, so that he prayed.|$|E
