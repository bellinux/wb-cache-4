25|$|On October 14, at 9:15p.m., 47-year-old Linda Franklin (née Moore), an FBI {{intelligence}} {{analyst who}} was a resident of Arlington County, Virginia, was shot dead in a covered parking lot at Home Depot {{with her husband in}} Fairfax County, Virginia, just outside Falls Church at Seven Corners Shopping Center. The police received what seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> lead after the October 14 shooting, but it was later determined that the witness was inside the Home Depot at the time and was lying. The witness was subsequently arrested for interfering with the investigation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase of whaling the hauls were {{generally}} good, some exceptional. For example, Mathijs Jansz. Hoepstock caught 44 whales in Hoepstockbukta in 1619, which produced 2,300 casks of whale oil. During the second phase the hauls were much lower. While 1631 turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> season, the following year, due to the weather and ice, only eight whales were caught. In 1633 eleven ships managed to catch just 47 whales; while a meager 42 were caught by the same number in 1635. The bowhead whale was locally hunted to near-extinction around 1640 (approximately 1000 had been killed and processed on the island), at which time Jan Mayen was abandoned and stayed uninhabited {{for two and a half}} centuries.|$|E
25|$|Other {{well-known}} vase {{painters of}} the time are the Painter of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton Painter, the Painter of Munich 1410 and the Swing Painter (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is not considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists. The work of the Rycroft Painter bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses outline drawings. The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted. The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with {{a new type of}} belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three Line Group. The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos Painter, the Madrid Painter and the imaginative Priam Painter.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I suppose it was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never seemed to me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E
500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E

Malik was appointed captain on 19 April 2007 by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), his experience considering his relatively young age and consistent performances were cited as other reasons for his appointment. At the age of just 25, he was Pakistan's fourth youngest captain.|$|E

Development priorities will focus on reducing the browser's size, integrating web applications and plug-ins, cloud capabilities and touch interface. The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared to Chrome 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a [...] "bloat taskforce". Larger download sizes are a problem {{for a number of}} reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: [...] "1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures / install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Result: The {{candidates}} were separated into teams by gender, {{with the boys}} choosing to call themselves [...] "Atomic" [...] and the girls calling themselves [...] "Kinetic." [...] Atomic went with a [...] "Pirate" [...] theme and were well organised during their production process thanks to Harry M.'s work on figures, and despite a slow start, they managed to sell all 601 of ice cream at Southend-on-Sea. By comparison, Kinetic, who went with a [...] "Treat and Trim" [...] theme, were severely disorganised while producing their ice cream and as Hayley, Lizzie and Hannah struggled with their figures, they had to throw away 40% of their mixture when the purchasing sub-team were unable to supply enough fruit, resulting in only 501 out of 801 being made. However, their location of Chessington World of Adventures proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> one, and despite not selling all of their ice cream, their more daring price (£3.20 for a cone, compared to Atomic's £1.50) strategy paid off, with Kinetic winning with a profit of £708.34, compared to Atomic's £559.25.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were only}} 33 T-26s, 18 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks and 6 T-26T {{artillery}} tractors in tank {{units of the}} 57th Special Corps on 1 February 1939. For comparison, the corps had 219 BT tanks. The situation with the T-26 remained as before in July 1939: the 1st Army Group, which participated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in Mongolia, had only 14 T-26s (in the 82nd Rifle Division) and 10 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks (in the 11th Tank Brigade). The amount of T-26 tanks (flame-throwing variants mainly) increased somewhat in time for combat actions in August, but they always remained {{a small fraction of}} all tanks that participated in the conflict. Nevertheless, the T-26s were used extensively in action. The T-26 proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> tank during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol according to army reports: [...] its cross-country capability in desert conditions was excellent and, despite thin armour (which was easily penetrated by Japanese 37mm guns), the T-26 exhibited high survivability. Some T-26 tanks continued to fight after several 37mm hits and did not catch fire, as happened more frequently with BT tanks.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interview}} that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the indulgences issue into a cause célèbre.

A. is a missionary, and he appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> sort of a fellow, but I cannot {{for the life of me}} approve of his methods....You see, when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. The first thing that they did was to get for living places the palaces of the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing them out. They took everything of value and sold it for a song. Then they let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they sustained. It was just as if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more missionaries." ...|$|E
