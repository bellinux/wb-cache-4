25|$|Real {{estate agent}} Frank Ventura (Chris Avram) and his lover Laura (Anna Maria Rosati) are {{plotting}} to {{take possession of}} the bay. After the Countess refuses to sell her home and property to them, the couple hatch a scheme with Donati to murder his wife. To finalize their plan, Ventura needs Donati's signature {{on a set of}} legal documents. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea,</b> however, that Donati himself has been killed.|$|E
2500|$|The programme's scoring is {{completely}} nonexistent. Similarly, in rounds such as [...] "Sound charades", where one team of panellists have {{to guess the}} charade of the other team, the answer may be obvious (usually a pun) but the opposing team pretends it is cryptic and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> and deliberately guess wrongly.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 2010, Thiel {{created the}} Thiel Fellowship, which {{annually}} awards $100,000 to 20 {{people under the}} age of 20 in order to spur them to drop out of college and create their own ventures. According to Thiel, for many young people, college is the path to take when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what to do with their lives: ...|$|E

6000|$|Ann Veronica {{came in with}} {{a certain}} {{disregard}} of Miss Miniver. [...] "That's it," [...] she said. [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> plans for us. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> what to do with us." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s another band started {{operating}} in Russia, reaching a cult status, Sektor Gaza. They created a genre called [...] "Kolkhoz Punk", which was mixing elements from Russian village life into punk music. However, while some called the band [...] "original" [...] and [...] "true folk punk," [...] others criticized the band's style. Mikhail Gorsheniov from Korol i Shut said: [...] "Sektor Gaza were never {{a part of}} the punk rock wave! <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> in music at all".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{final scene}} Don still {{has one of}} the {{currency}} plates, which the police think was destroyed by the explosion. Sameer was actually loyal to Don; informing the police was part of the plan. The disc Don gave them actually contains the names of the European drug cartel; when they are arrested, Don becomes king of the European underworld and tells Ayesha and Sameer <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how rich they will become. When Ayesha tells him she was afraid he would be caught, he says: [...] "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai" [...] ("It is not just hard to catch Don, it is impossible.") and the film ends with the song [...] "Dushman Mera".|$|E
2500|$|Boxing {{has been}} a part of Mayweather's life since his {{childhood}} and he never seriously considered any other profession. [...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E
50|$|Though {{there are}} rumors that this event {{occurred}} due {{to the success of}} a similar event called 'Baumaus', the two clubs promoting this event claim that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that 'Baumaus' ever happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not--I don't suppose she has. But young ladies {{sometimes}} {{allow themselves to}} fall in love, and then to think themselves very ill-used, just because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> in their head." ...|$|R

2500|$|In [...] "Parasite", Bennet is {{questioned}} by Thompson; {{he claims that}} {{the last thing he}} remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to [...] "clean up" [...] Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. [...] "Sandra" [...] then transforms back into Candice, {{and other members of the}} Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{place of}} the divi among state deities is far from clear. They had {{precedent}} in the di parentes, who were elevated to [...] "godhead" [...] by their sons and accorded ancestral rites, but dead ancestors, no matter how honoured, remained manes of the underworld. A mortal did not normally possess the divine power (numen), which according to Gradel [...] "can also be synonymous with deus". Official divi were politico-religious creations of the senate {{or at least the}} senate played a formal role in their creation. As long as the correct rituals and sacrifice were offered, the divus would be received by the heavenly gods as a coelicola (a dweller in heaven), a lesser being than themselves. What the divus was supposed to be or do in heaven was left to imagination, not theology. Popular belief held that the divus Augustus would be personally welcomed by Jupiter but in Seneca's Apocolocyntosis, the unexpected arrival of Augustus' equally divine descendant Claudius creates a problem for the Olympians. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who or what he is and when they find out, they cannot think what to do with him. Seneca's sarcastic wit, an unacceptable impiety towards a deus, freely portrays the divus Claudius as just a dead, ridiculous and possibly quite bad emperor.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Wyden {{was one of}} 10 {{senators}} to vote against re-authorization of the Patriot Act. In 2011, with the expiration of the Patriot Act approaching and with efforts to reauthorize the Act once more intensifying, Wyden and fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley sharply criticized the rush to pass the bill. Wyden stated on the Senate floor that [...] "The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago {{during a period of}} understandable fear. Now is the time to revisit this, revisit it and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty." [...] Wyden and Merkley expressed particular concern with a provision of current law allowing law enforcement authorities to collect [...] "a vast array of business records, emails, phone numbers, [...] even DNA from anyone deemed 'relevant' to an investigation." [...] Wyden offered an amendment to reform the [...] "business-records provision" [...] of the Patriot Act, which he views as being used in an abusive and secret way. In a May 2011 speech in the Senate, Wyden sharply criticized the use of Patriot Act, stating: [...] "The fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the Patriot Act, and yet many members of Congress have no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch, because that interpretation is classified. It's almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members of Congress have not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what their government believes the law actually means." [...] In an interview for the documentary [...] Wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations (or [...] "targeted killings") of American citizens by their government, and responded that [...] "the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret," [...] but that he [...] "is not permitted" [...] to disclose the difference publicly.|$|E
60|$|They did so, {{and soon}} the four young hunters were {{standing}} in the sopping wet brushwood {{on the edge of the}} lake. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> landed and only a dim notion regarding the location of their camp.|$|R
50|$|The {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} and then questioned by Swiss Polizei before being released {{and returned to}} their hotel at 1am the next morning. Until then <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how many people had died nor {{the enormity of the}} disaster.|$|R
60|$|When {{the team}} was ready, Dick and Jim started out {{for the purpose of}} having their horses harnessed, since <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> but that <b>they</b> were to {{accompany}} the expedition, but such was not a portion of Bob's plan.|$|R

50|$|Nirvana asked Shonen Knife {{to serve}} as their opening act for their UK tour, {{just prior to the}} release of their {{breakthrough}} album, Nevermind. Yamano later admitted that when Cobain asked them to open for his band, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who Nirvana were.|$|R

If there are such policies, I think it is wise that everyone — not just those with leadership callings — knows about them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} another thing against you: that is, the jealousy of the various provinces. There is no common effort. When Valencia is invaded, for example, the Valencians fight; but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of going out from their homes to assist Castile or Catalonia and so, one after another, the provinces are conquered by the French." ...|$|E

60|$|Tea and Coffee, without hot water.--In Unyoro, Sir S. Baker says, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{of using}} coffee as a drink, but simply chew it raw as a stimulant. In Chinese Tartary, {{travellers}} {{who have no}} means of making a cup of tea, will chew the leaves as a substitute. Mr. Atkinson told me how very grateful he had found this makeshift.|$|E
50|$|Developmental {{prosopagnosia}} can be {{a difficult}} thing {{for a child to}} both understand and cope with. Many adults with developmental prosopagnosia report {{that for a long time}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a deficit in face processing, unaware that others could distinguish people solely on facial differences.|$|R
50|$|More than {{a century}} ago the Meches used to {{practice}} ‘jhum’ cultivation, that is cutting and burning the jungles and then sowing different seeds in each hole made by dibblers and sowers. Short-staple cotton was their cash crop. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of cultivation with bullocks and the plough.|$|R
50|$|When Mr. and Mrs. Lane invited charming French woman Annette Reynaud {{to their}} brownstone for {{dinner with the}} family, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{that she was a}} jewel burglar whose real name was Michelle, and that Mrs. Lane's younger brother Richard Duffy had known Michelle from his past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exciting, par Dieu! Of {{course it}} will be exciting. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that I guessed their little machinations. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen {{travelling}} to Paris forsooth! Aye! but with five and twenty millions sewn somewhere inside her petticoats. Well! the Emperor happens to want his own five and twenty millions, if you please. So Mme. la Duchesse or M. le Comte will have to disgorge. And I shall have the pleasing task of making them disgorge. What say you to that, friend Clyffurde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but {{the seventh}} {{know what they}} want. They want to be masters. They want money enough to keep them without work. They want to set the streets flowing with blood. The other six only {{want to be left}} alone. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of risking their lives, and you will see, when it begins, they will hold the butts of their muskets up; they will say, 'Don't let us irritate these demons,' and each man will hope that, even if others are robbed, he will somehow escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy it's kid," [...] Hawtry said. [...] "Well, it {{is evident}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of cutting our throats.

Where it's coming from as far as I'm concerned, I don't know, for my father is a clergyman, and has as much as he can do to make ends meet, for there are eight of us and I'm the eldest." ...|$|E
