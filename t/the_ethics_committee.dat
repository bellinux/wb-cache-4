5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. <b>The</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E

25|$|In July 2011, the House Ethics Committee {{announced}} that it was investigating accusations that Schmidt had accepted roughly $500,000 in free legal services from a Turkish-American interest group (the Turkish Coalition of America). Schmidt said that she hadn't received a bill for the legal services in question, and that she had been waiting {{for more than a year}} for guidance from <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> on the proper procedure to pay the bill. In August 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> rendered its decision, holding that the interest group's payment for legal services in connection with her proceedings against Krikorian had been improper, and ordering Schmidt to repay the group $500,000.|$|E

40|$|Biomedical ethics {{gave birth}} to {{different}} kinds of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> which pursue essentially {{a better understanding of}} the multidisciplinary problems it raises. The present thesis will first elucidate the legal implications related to the emergence of those committees. These preliminary considerations will show the topicality of those legal aspects as to hospital <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> <b>The</b> author will then focus on the potential civil liability of all actors evolving within the hospital setting for the participation of those committees in the medical decision making process. In theory, this participation could arguably entail rather easily the liability of the health care providers and of <b>the</b> hospitals. <b>The</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees,</b> on <b>the</b> contrary, seem to be more protected. This thesis suggests nonetheless that the obligations related to the participation of <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> to <b>the</b> medical decision making process are significant. Hence, it stands to reason that <b>the</b> creation of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> should be evaluated with care. The conviction that <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> will protect <b>the</b> health care providers from malpractice suits appears to be incorrect in any event...|$|R

25|$|In November 2005, it was {{reported}} that Ney had set up a legal defense fund for himself in connection with the Abramoff case. Documents filed in the House in January 2006 showed that <b>the</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> had approved the organization papers for the fund. The fund raised $40,000 between January and March 2006, and nothing between April and June 2006. The fund did not spend any money for Ney's legal expenses. Ney's withdrawal from the race (see below) meant that he could use his remaining campaign funds (almost half a million dollars) for his legal defense.|$|E
25|$|Opas, {{convinced}} of Ryan's innocence, {{agreed to work}} without pay. Opas consulted <b>the</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Bar Council to seek approval to make a public appeal for a solicitor prepared to brief him, as Opas was prepared to pay his travel, other expenses and appear without fee. The Committee said {{that this would be}} touting for business and was unethical. Opas argued that a man's life was at stake and he could not see how he would be touting when no payment was involved. Opas defied the ruling and on national radio sought an instructor. Opas was inundated with offers and accepted the first application, being from Ralph Freadman. Alleyne Kiddle was in London completing a master's degree and she agreed to take a junior brief without a fee.|$|E
25|$|Reports by investigative {{journalists have}} linked FIFA {{leadership}} with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging {{related to the}} election of FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. {{are expected to be}} extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017 reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee,</b> Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On May 9, 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, eleven of 13 committee members were removed.|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, the {{non-profit}} National Legal and Policy Center filed an ethics complaint against Rangel {{and other members}} of Congress for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to Caribbean islands.
