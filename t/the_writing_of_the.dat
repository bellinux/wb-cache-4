5|$|April 8 through April 10. The Feast of the Three Days of <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E

5|$|Both {{character}} and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress {{award from the}} Broadcasting Press Guild for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and {{was nominated for a}} British Comedy Award. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with Asherman's syndrome in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% {{increase in the number of}} people taking out life insurance policies with one provider, Tesco Personal Finance, which a spokesperson for the company attributed to Rachel's premature death.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record.

There was certainly some whisky involved in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's {{head with}} him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and {{was instrumental in the}} Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.|$|E

J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work closely {{in the region of}} AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E

To this end, sixty intermediate learners of English, majoring in Literature and Translation, studying at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz participated in the research and then were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental and the comparison. During <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> this study, i. e. 10 sessions, the participants were assigned to <b>write</b> compositions <b>of</b> about 150 words on eight writing topics. To find out whether there is any significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learners who receive join construction instruction, two tests were used to compare <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groups: a pretest prior and a posttest. Results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Data analysis indicated that there is a significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learners who receive join construction instruction.

5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in {{the scene of the}} attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his {{characters}} on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to get him out.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{sent the}} Theses {{enclosed}} {{with a letter}} to Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, on 31 October 1517, a date now considered {{the start of the}} Reformation and commemorated annually as Reformation Day. Luther may have also posted the Theses on the door of All Saints' Church and other churches in Wittenberg in accordance with University custom on 31 October or in mid-November. The Theses were quickly reprinted, translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They initiated a pamphlet war with indulgence preacher Johann Tetzel, which spread Luther's fame even further. Luther's ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for heresy, which culminated in his excommunication in 1521. Though the Theses were the start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to be as important as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will. His breakthrough on these issues would come later, and he did not see <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theses as the point at which his beliefs diverged from those of Rome.|$|E

Animation work began in July while the storyboards were only a quarter complete; Miyazaki had to complete them during the animation production. Production wrapped {{up at the end of}} November and the film's premier on December 15, 1979 was a short seven and a half months from the project's undertaking, with only five months of production time.|$|E
