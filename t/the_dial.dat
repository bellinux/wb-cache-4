5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. <b>The</b> <b>dial</b> moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. <b>The</b> <b>dial</b> has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dial</b> of the Zytglogge's {{astronomical clock}} is {{built in the}} form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically {{projected}} planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.|$|E
2500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>Dials</b> illustrators, {{responsible}} {{for many of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dials</b> covers, was Edward Hopper. Hopper won a nationwide competition during the war for a patriotic poster design entitled [...] "Smash The Hun". The design, which featured a Morse company worker swinging a large sledgehammer toward a nest of threatening bayonets, was later reproduced (without the accompanying caption) {{on the cover of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dials</b> February 1919 edition. Hopper would later achieve fame as a leading artist of the American realist school.|$|R
50|$|A dial {{is said to}} be {{equiangular}} if its hour-lines {{are straight}} and spaced equally. Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include <b>the</b> equatorial <b>dial,</b> <b>the</b> equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, <b>the</b> cylindrical <b>dial</b> and <b>the</b> conical <b>dial.</b> However, other designs are equiangular, such as <b>the</b> Lambert <b>dial,</b> a version of <b>the</b> analemmatic <b>dial</b> with a moveable style.|$|R

5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> of his pocket watch to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dial</b> M for Monkey shorts feature Dexter's pet {{laboratory}} monkey named Monkey (vocal effects {{provided by}} Frank Welker), whom Dexter believes is an ordinary monkey and nothing more. However, Monkey secretly has superpowers and fights evil as the superhero Monkey. Monkey {{is joined by}} his partner Agent Honeydew (voiced by Kath Soucie) of Global Security, her director the Commander General (voiced by Robert Ridgely in Season 1, Earl Boen in Season 2), {{and a team of}} assembled superheroes. Dial M for Monkey was created by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, and Paul Rudish.|$|E

5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because the plane of <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> face {{is parallel to the}} Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
5|$|When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, {{looks for}} relief from his weary watch, {{he turns his}} eyes toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight {{approaches}} the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passingthat relief and rest are close at hand.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E

This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all call attempts made.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> rotary <b>dial</b> is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as pulse <b>dialing,</b> corresponding to <b>the</b> number <b>dialed.</b> <b>The</b> early form of <b>the</b> rotary <b>dial</b> used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. <b>The</b> rotary <b>dial</b> was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|R
5|$|Sparrow's {{weapons are}} genuine 18th century pieces: his sword {{dates to the}} 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived {{production}} of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.|$|E
5|$|The Everett Station complex also {{includes}} a bus station with 26 bus bays that serve as a major transfer station for routes from Snohomish County. Everett Transit operates {{the majority of its}} bus routes out of their 12 bus bays on Smith Avenue. Community Transit has six routes at the station, serving as the terminus for local service from Smokey Point, Marysville, Snohomish, Lake Stevens, and Monroe; CT also debuted their Swift bus rapid transit service in 2009, with Everett Station as the northern terminus of the route along the Highway 99 corridor to Shoreline. Sound Transit runs three of its ST Express bus routes out of Everett Station, with peak-only, limited-stop service to Seattle and Bellevue, as well as all-day service to Seattle via Lynnwood Transit Center, along Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Skagit Transit runs a weekday inter-county express route (Route 90X) from the station to the Skagit Transportation Center in Mount Vernon and Chuckanut Park & Ride in Burlington; Island Transit also runs a peak-only weekday express route (Route 412C) from Everett Station to Stanwood and Camano Island.

Being the London correspondent for <b>The</b> <b>Dial</b> magazine and a college friend of its co-owner and co-editor, Scofield Thayer, <b>The</b> <b>Dial</b> was an ideal choice. Even though <b>The</b> <b>Dial</b> offered $150 (£34) for the poem (25% more than its standard rate) Eliot was offended that a year's work would be valued so low, especially since another contributor {{was found to have}} been given exceptional compensation for a short story. The deal with <b>The</b> <b>Dial</b> almost fell through (other magazines considered were the Little Review and Vanity Fair), but with Pound's efforts eventually a deal was worked out where, in addition to the $150, Eliot would be awarded The Dials second annual prize for outstanding service to letters.
