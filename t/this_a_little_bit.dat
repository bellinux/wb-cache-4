5000|$|In March 2015, it was {{announced}} that the character of Simon would be involved in a domestic abuse, with it being where Simon is the perpetrator and his mother Leanne would be the victim.

In this point all the girls {{seem to have a}} love interest in the guys from Corozal.

Juana Manny dates Octavio Portorreal. The explosive personality of Juana Manny makes Octavio to reconsider their relationship, but he, like Mauricio, gets to understand Juana Manny and keeps a stable relationship with the boxing girl. Juana Matilde starts to date Miguel Tejeros, and they begin a relationship but Juana Matilde's freedom makes Miguel to believe that if he keeps a relationship with her, Juana Matilde eventually is pushing him away from her in order to keep her freedom, but it does not happen. Miguel's mother -closest friend of Doña - decides to leave him without money for not to let him help the girls.|$|E
5000|$|Cindy's 'gold-digging' {{personality}} became clearer {{after her}} return. Cindy and Darren Osborne decided to scam Tony Hutchinson {{out of his}} money. However, the character changed her plans and decided not to marry Tony for his money. Talking about {{the conclusion of the}} storyline, Waring stated: [...] "I think she's definitely out for what she can get — she's always {{going to be up to}} something! We're going to have to see what happens with this but I don't think she'll change who she's become over the last eight years in Spain. It's important that we see she's not this one-dimensional gold-digging tart, though. There were some episodes in normal Hollyoaks where we saw <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> when she thought Tony was just with her for her looks and Holly didn't want to be like her. In Later this spills out again and we get to see more of the Cindy there once was before moving to Spain." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "She uses her outer image to hide who she really is inside and in Later we discover she's just a normal girl who wants to find love and security and have a secure life with her daughter and have a family — she's found that in Tony." [...] After their postponed wedding, Cindy admitted her plans to Tony and the pair split up, however they agreed to get married, which they did in Hollyoaks Later.|$|E
5000|$|Basically, it's {{about the}} fact that you can't hide what you're really like. I just had this image of the average American hero - {{somebody}} like a Clint Eastwood or a John Wayne. Somebody with eyes like slits, who was basically capable of anything - you know, any kind of murderous act or whatever to get what was required - to get, let's say, his people to safety. And yet, to those people he's saving, he's a great hero, a knight in shining armor - forget the fact that he cut off fifty people's heads to get them home safely. Then I thought about the Russians and the Chinese and the Arab communities and the South Americans; you've got these different ethnic groups, and each has this central image of every other political or national faction as being, in some way, the evil ones. And I've taken <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> further - because I spent so much of my time in society, high society, last year - to comment on stardom and power and drug use and decadence, and how there's a strange parallel, in a way, between the misuse of power and responsibility by inept politicians and the misuse of power and responsibility by people who are heroes. If you're really a good person, you can't hide it by acting bad; and if you're a bad person, you can't hide it by acting good. Also - more to the point, really - that there's no outward, identifiable evil, you know? People spend most of their time looking for evil and identifying evil outside themselves. But the potential for evil is inside you.|$|E

5000|$|Cyrus [...] "CyFi" [...] Finch age 15, is {{introduced}} just after Lev {{is separated from}} Risa and Connor. This character helps Lev learn to scavenge for food in the food courts of malls. Not much is known about him at first, other than he's a proud Umber. [...] "Umber" [...] is explained in the book as a word invented to describe blacks. The inventor of the word was [...] "this artist dude - mixed-race himself, {{a little bit of}} <b>this,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of that". CyFi explains that the artist painted darker skin tones with a paint named [...] "Umber," [...] and that [...] "it just stuck". Later on, the reader learns that CyFi was originally a storked child who was taken in by two fathers. Unlike Connor, Risa, and Lev, CyFi is not an Unwind. Rather, he ran away from his family because the thoughts from an Unwind's temporal lobe, which he received after a car accident, spontaneously took over his own thoughts. Because part of his brain once belonged to an Unwind, CyFi considers himself one-eighth Tyler, the Unwind, and seven-eighths himself. He describes himself as an ancestor of the 'Deep South' - this later shows the reader the difference/changing between Cyrus and Tyler. Tyler was Unwound because of his constant stealing, and we learn that the part of his brain that he is alive in, Tyler does not understand that he is no longer living in his own body. CyFi's case is unusual because brain transplants are normally done with tiny pieces from multiple donors. However, CyFi's fathers paid off a doctor to acquire one full piece of the temporal lobe. This helps CyFi maintain his high IQ, but also results in compulsive orders from the donor. Cyrus constantly fights between the disorder he is now dealing with (kleptomania) and being himself. Also, because of the portion of the brain he received, he often feels Tyler's emotions and, on rare occasions, swears he can actually even see the boy in the mirror.|$|E
40|$|Many of you {{may wonder}} why anyone would spend {{the better part of}} a {{life-time}} doing little more than recording from retinal ganglion cells, as I have done, so, I will give some justification for <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> later. Since John Robson has more sense than I, he has done a lot of other things than studied ganglion cells. However, the fact remains that it was John's interest in the behavior of retinal ganglion cells which twenty years ago caused Fergus Campbell to "ship John across the Atlantic " to Northwestern University "to dirty his fingers " with visual neurophysiology. I owe Fergus Campbell much gratitude for having provided me with the opportunity and privilege to work with John, to keep him awake during nightly experiments by giving him frequent feedings and to make life almost intoler-able for him by nagging about writing up the results. I hope that I have rendered visual sciences a small service by, in this way, having served as "supportive tissue " for John's brain. The introductory, very basic, comments on retinal ganglion cell characteristics which follow will, I hope, serve as a necessary background for John's quantitative description of cat ganglion cell behavior and also serve as a tribute to Ragnar Granit and Stephen Kuffler who laid the foundations for our knowledge of, and sub-sequent approach to, this fascinating subject...|$|E
