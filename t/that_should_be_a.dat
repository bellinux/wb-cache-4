25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E
25|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon (because {{that was where}} Reagan was living at the time), and that court ended up dismissing the action. Eitel appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in 1997, reinstated the case and allowed the Justice Department to join Eitel as a plaintiff in the suit. At this time, the case was also transferred to District Court in Arizona. Eitel and the Justice Department, however, disagreed over the allegations of CIA involvement, and whether <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor in the suit. The DoJ filed motions in 1998 to drop several of the defendants, provoking a sharp disagreement between Eitel and the Department, and resulting in Eitel's accusation that the DoJ was covering up covert activities and evidence.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Aaron Thomas {{rated the}} Wii version's motion control scheme as [...] "uninteresting and {{occasionally}} frustrating". X-Play's Morgan Webb agreed, calling the controls [...] "non-intuitive" [...] and commenting that the minigames required players to [...] "wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons {{at the same}} time". Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pure pick-up-and-play party game". Tae Kim said the events were [...] "short and fairly shallow" [...] and mostly required players to move the [...] "Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways—rapidly up and down for running events, for example". Mark Bozon of IGN called Mario & Sonic a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, he and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; Bozon noted that diversity was lacking as [...] "five or six [...] nearly identical", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes {{with that of the}} Mario sport games and archery.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, {{second baseman}} Chase Utley had hip surgery and was {{scheduled}} to be out for four to six months. However, on December 15, Utley said in a press conference that he could be ready for Opening Night. Just under four months later, Utley made his first pre-season game appearance in an intersquad game March 14, and his first appearance in actual game competition the next day against the St. Louis Cardinals. Third baseman Pedro Feliz also had surgery on his back to repair a herniated disc on the same day as Utley. Feliz officially returned to spring training action on March 13. During spring training, starting pitcher Cole Hamels left training camp on March 16 and flew to Philadelphia to have his left elbow examined by Dr. Michael Ciccotti. Hamels felt tightness in between innings and after he was done pitching for the day. [...] "This will obviously set me back a couple of days, and I don’t think <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> big deal", said Hamels. However, the injury threw his Opening Day start against the Braves into doubt, even though Ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm; Brett Myers was announced as Hamels' replacement to start Opening Night.|$|E

[...] "This will obviously set me {{back a couple of}} days, and I don't think <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> big deal", said Hamels. Ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm, yet Hamels still did not pitch on Opening Day as expected; Myers did for the third consecutive season. For {{the first time in his}} career, he went winless in his first four starts, and left back-to-back starts early due to injury in late April, sustaining a left-shoulder contusion and an ankle sprain respectively. From June on, however, he returned to his previous form, recording two complete-game shutouts (tied for the NL-lead), striking out at least 10 batters in two separate games, and amassing a 21-inning scoreless streak from August 21 to September 6, while allowing just two home runs in his final eight starts. In July, the Phillies augmented their starting rotation by acquiring two former Cy Young Award winners in Cliff Lee and Pedro Martínez from a trade and a free agent signing respectively. Due to his early season injury struggles, Hamels posted a 10–11 record and a 4.32 ERA in the regular season, his first major league season in which he posted a sub-.500 record, and the worst ERA of his career to that point.|$|E

Education and scholarship was also a primary concern for Mormon women. Religious missions, like Bathsheba W. Smith's mission to southern Utah to preach [...] "woman's rights", were launched.

It is important that we begin this project now to ensure that a new bomber can be ready before the current aging fleet goes out of service.

[...] In July 2011, Joint Chief Vice Chairman James Cartwright called for a large UAV instead of a manned aircraft, including for the nuclear mission. Retired Air Force colonel and Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments analyst Mark Gunzinger has called for an optionally manned bomber, stating that purely unmanned bombers would be at a disadvantage without direct human pilot awareness and vulnerable to communication disruption.|$|E

Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that despite {{his reputation as a}} budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved. [...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen.

Quote [...] "As reported in 2009 Bruno Heller, who wrote and executive produced the series, is writing the movie script as well; the film will be produced by Morning Light Productions.
