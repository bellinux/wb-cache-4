These regions – known as molecular clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements.

5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula</b> and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula.</b> Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> <b>nebula.</b>|$|E

The asterism retained this name even when it was discovered that there were yet more stars in the group. However, it has since been determined that <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula</b> is a stellar nursery and that the Trapezium is actually an Open Cluster. Thus it is no longer an asterism.

25|$|Orion's seven {{brightest}} stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped asterism, or pattern, {{in the night}} sky.

Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed. The Trapezium cluster has many newborn stars, including several brown dwarfs, all of which are at an approximate distance of 1,500 light-years. Named for the four bright stars that form a trapezoid, it is largely illuminated by the brightest stars, which are only a few hundred thousand years old. Observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show both the extreme temperatures of the main stars—up to 60,000 kelvins—and the star forming regions still extant in the surrounding nebula.|$|E
25|$|To the Lakota Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is {{the spine}} of a bison.

Another Lakota myth mentions that {{the bottom half of}} Orion, the Constellation of the Hand, represented the arm of a chief that was ripped off by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was human) returned his arm and married his daughter, symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity {{with the help of the}} younger generation.

40|$|Recent Hubble Space Telescope {{images have}} allowed the {{determination}} with unprecedented accuracy of motions and changes of shocks within <b>the</b> inner <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula.</b> These originate from collimated outflows from very young stars, some within the ionized portion of the nebula and others within the host molecular cloud.

While some isolated shocks are driven by single collimated outflows, many groups of shocks {{are the result of}} a single stellar source having jets oriented in multiple directions at similar times. This explains the feature that shocks aligned in opposite directions in the plane of the sky are usually blue shifted because the redshifted outflows pass into the optically thick Photon Dominated Region behind the nebula.
