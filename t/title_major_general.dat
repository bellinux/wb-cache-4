5000|$|Thomas Weh Syen (died August 1981) was a Liberian {{soldier and}} politician. He {{was a leading}} {{member of the group}} of enlisted men that {{overthrow}} the country's government in an April 1980 military coup d'état, and accordingly {{he became one of the}} leaders of the new military junta, the People's Redemption Council. In the wake of the coup d'état, he took the <b>title</b> of <b>major</b> <b>general</b> in the Armed Forces of Liberia and became the co-chairman of the PRC; as a result, he was the immediate deputy of Commander-in-Chief Samuel Doe and the Vice Head of State. [...] From the earliest days of the PRC, Doe and Syen clashed; testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2008 revealed that their disagreements began during the coup itself, when Weh Syen and Doe forcibly disagreed about the disposal of money that had been stolen from the home of the newly murdered President William R. Tolbert, Jr. [...] While a member of the PRC, he was partly responsible for educational affairs, but his time on the Council was short-lived. After allegedly attempting to overthrow Doe in a second coup, five PRC members, including Weh Syen, were shot in August 1981 on Doe's orders. [...] Weh Syen was tried in a court-martial at the Temple of Justice in Monrovia. He was replaced as Vice Head of State by PRC Speaker J. Nicholas Podier.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{after turning}} eighteen, Sree Chithira Thirunal's {{investiture}} ceremony wasn't done and his accession to full power looked unlikely, as rumors were spread {{about him that}} he was not mentally stable and hence not qualified to occupy the throne. His mother, Maharani Sethu Parvathi Bayi, contacted Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, a family friend, who then presented Sree Chithira Thirunal's case to the then Viceroy of India, Lord Wellington, and arranged a meeting between the two. After meeting the young Monarch, the Viceroy was highly impressed and found the rumours baseless, and thus all the obstacles, in Sree Chithira Thirunal's accession to power, were removed. As Sree Chithira Thirunal was quite young, and because of the amount of controversy that had been swirling around him, Viceroy Lord Wellington insisted that Sir C.P. must become the Legal and Constitutional Adviser to the young Monarch. Sree Chithira Thirunal attained full ruling powers on 6 November 1931, with the <b>title</b> : <b>Major</b> <b>General</b> His Highness Sree Padmanabhadasa Vanchipala Sree Chithira Thirunal Sir Balarama Varma III, Manney Sultan Maharajah Raja Ramaraja Bahadur, Shamsher Jang, Maharajah of Travancore, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. As was customary, he took the regnal name Sree Chithira Thirunal as he was born under the Chithira nakshatram or star. ln his speech, after assuming full power as the Maharajah of Travancore, he declared : [...] "It is my hope that I shall be enabled by God’s grace to earn the affection and esteem of all communities and classes amongst my people whose advancement in every department of life will be my perpetual pre-occupation and my sole aim." ...|$|R
