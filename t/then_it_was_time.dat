2500|$|On Friday 26 October 2007 for the People in Need Telethon [...] Podge and Rodge {{finally got}} to {{interview}} their nemesis and ultimate rival, the then host of The Late Late Show and [...] "Ireland's Alan Partridge" [...] Pat Kenny. [...] "Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?" [...] He was asked: [...] "Does it get on your tits though when people are saying, Jaysus - Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying me to watch that shite!" [...] He was also asked: [...] "Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who {{came up with that}} beauty?" [...] Pat blamed it on Eamon Dunphy. [...] "Are you bored with the wood puns?" [...] they asked to which Pat jibed: [...] "In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for a quick game of [...] "Plankety Plank" [...] which featured author Patricia Cornwell - he'd forgotten her name; Dawn French - he'd told her he'd give her €10 not to get out of bed; Brigitte Nielsen - she'd forced him to dance live on TV. Comparing Pat's bike to Gaybo's Harley-Davidson they asked: [...] "Did Fisher Price make that?" [...] And then it was back to Tubbicino, Teletubby...|$|E

60|$|A {{pleasant}} journey, a {{great deal}} of hugging and kissing, some tears and tender laments for baby, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to show the quilt, which mamma said was just what she wanted to throw over her feet as she lay on the sofa.|$|E
60|$|Those {{last few}} hours sped like winged moments. We talked and planned a little, I divided my outfit among my friends, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for the train.

60|$|A {{pleasant}} half-hour or so was passed, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for Myles to go. He lingered for a {{while before}} he took his final leave, leaning against the door-post, and laughingly telling how he and some of his brother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men's clothes, and had played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom they bore a grudge.|$|E
40|$|African {{agriculture}} receives {{considerable attention}} from the international donor community yet few of these initiatives {{pay attention to the}} price farmers receive for their product.

6000|$|At dawn we arose, washed, prayed, {{and broke}} our fast[FN#22] upon a crust of stale bread, before smoking a pipe, and {{drinking}} {{a cup of}} coffee.[FN#23] <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to dress, to mount, and to visit the Harim {{or one of the}} Holy Places outside the city.

6000|$|Carley {{went downstairs}} to the living room, and {{made no effort to}} resist a rush to the open fire. Flo and her mother were amused at Carley's impetuosity. [...] "You'll like that stingin' of the air after you get used to it," [...] said Mrs. Hutter. Carley had her doubts. When she was {{thoroughly}} thawed out she discovered an appetite quite unusual for her, and she enjoyed her breakfast. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to sally forth to meet Glenn.|$|E
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over for several minutes, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{for the train}} to leave Chicago. The paper {{looked as if it}} might be in Link Merwell's {{handwriting}} and the boys concluded that he was the guilty party. Probably he had come to the train, knowing our friends were away on the sight-seeing tour, and possibly he had been disguised, maybe with a false mustache, or wig, or both. The porter was almost certain the man had worn a heavy black mustache.|$|E

5000|$|New Year's Eve in Greece {{has many}} traditions. During the day, {{children}} sing the New Year's carols {{to be given}} money or treats. <b>Then,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to have family lunch or dinner. In the evening, people cook a pie named [...] "King's pie (Vassilopita locally)", which is a cake flavored with almonds.

60|$|They {{sat for a}} {{space in}} a public-house, the one {{answering}} the questions of the other about this person and that, reviving queer old points of view, brushing aside endless new aspects and new perspectives, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to go to the}} station and take the London train. Their names and the personal things they had to talk of do not matter to our story, but only the changes and all the strangeness that this poor returning soul found in the once familiar world.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to fire a}} gun, for a pilot; {{and almost}} before its smoke had cleared away, a little boat with a light at her {{masthead}} came bearing down upon us, through the darkness, swiftly. And presently, our sails being backed, she ran alongside; and the hoarse pilot, wrapped and muffled in pea-coats and shawls to the very bridge of his weather-ploughed-up nose, stood bodily among us on the deck. And I think if that pilot had wanted to borrow fifty pounds for an indefinite period on no security, we should have engaged to lend it to him, among us, before his boat had dropped astern, or (which is the same thing) before every scrap of news in the paper {{he brought with him}} had become the common property of all on board.|$|E
60|$|I thought <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{for me to}} be gone, for I had no {{manner of}} courage for that risk; and I think verily I was more afraid of being taken sick in a strange country than ever I was of being killed in battle. Upon this {{resolution}} I procured a pass to go for Genoa, and accordingly began my journey, but was arrested at Villa Franca by a slow lingering fever, which held me about five days, and then turned to a burning malignancy, and at last to the plague. My friend, the captain, never left me night nor day; and though for four days more I knew nobody, nor was capable of so much as thinking of myself, yet it pleased God that the distemper gathered in my neck, swelled and broke. During the swelling I was raging mad with the violence of pain, which being so near my head swelled that also in proportion, that my eyes were swelled up, and for the twenty-four hours my tongue and mouth; then, as my servant told me, all the physicians gave me over, as past all remedy, but by the good providence of God the swelling broke.|$|E

50|$|Step three was to “Break down food, {{clothing}} and shelter; fulfil food, {{clothing and}} shelter”. This is a vivid {{description of the}} Jesus Family lifestyle which meant that the new members must change their old habits on food, clothing and shelter. For example, if you like wearing flash clothes, eating delicious buffets, and living in luxurious mansions (which is what everyone craves for), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> give up all these habits by stop being materialistic and start living a more simplified life.|$|R

6000|$|In 1881, {{the time}} of the golden wedding came round for that sad and pretty household. It fell on a Good Friday, and its celebration can {{scarcely}} be recalled without both smiles and tears. The drawing-room was filled with presents and beautiful bouquets; these, to Fleeming and his family, the golden bride and bridegroom displayed with unspeakable pride, she so painfully excited that the guests feared every moment to see her stricken afresh, he guiding and moderating her with his customary tact and understanding, and doing the honours of the day with more than his usual delight. [...] Thence they were brought to the dining-room, where the Captain's idea of a feast awaited them: tea and champagne, fruit and toast and childish little luxuries, set forth pell-mell and pressed at random on the guests. And here he must make a speech for himself and his wife, praising their destiny, their marriage, their son, their daughter-in-law, their grandchildren, their manifold causes of gratitude: surely the most innocent speech, the old, sharp contemner of his innocence now watching him with eyes of admiration. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for the guests to depart; and they went away, bathed, even to the youngest child, in tears of inseparable sorrow and gladness, and leaving the golden bride and bridegroom to their own society and that of the hired nurse.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{had never}} shown much fondness at home, for the {{refinements}} of good female society. Abroad, {{he had lived}} as exclusively as he possibly could, among women whose characters ranged downwards by infinitesimal degrees, from the mysteriously doubtful to the notoriously bad. The highly-bred, highly-refined, highly-accomplished young English beauties had no charm for him. He detected at once the domestic conspiracy {{of which he was}} destined to become the victim. He often came up-stairs, at night, into my bed-room; and while he was amusing himself by derisively kicking about my simple clothes and simple toilette apparatus; while he was laughing in his old careless way at my quiet habits and monotonous life, used to slip in, parenthetically, all sorts of sarcasms about our young lady guests. To him, their manners were horribly inanimate; their innocence, hypocrisy of education. Pure complexions and regular features were very well, he said, as far as they went; but when a girl could not walk properly, when she shook hands with you with cold fingers, when having good eyes she could not make a stimulating use of them, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to sentence the regular features and pure complexions to be taken back forthwith to the nursery from which they came. For his part, he missed the conversation of his witty Polish Countess, and longed for another pancake-supper with his favourite grisettes.|$|E
6000|$|You could {{generally}} tell an Auld Licht in Thrums {{when you}} passed him, his dull vacant face wrinkled over a heavy wob. He wore tags of yarn round his trousers beneath the knee, {{that looked like}} ostentatious garters, and frequently his jacket of corduroy was put on beneath his waistcoat. If {{he was too old}} to carry his load on his back, he wheeled it on a creaking barrow, and when he met a friend they said, [...] "Ay, Jeames," [...] and [...] "Ay, Davit," [...] and then could think of nothing else. At long intervals they passed through the square, disappearing or coming into sight round the town-house which stands {{on the south side of}} it, and guards the entrance to a steep brae that leads down and then twists up on its lonely way to the county town. I like to linger over the square, for it was from an upper window in it that I got to know Thrums. On Saturday nights, when the Auld Licht young men came into the square dressed and washed to look at the young women errand-going, and to laugh sometime afterwards to each other, it presented a glare of light; and here even came the cheap jacks and the Fair Circassian, and the showman, who, besides playing [...] "The Mountain Maid and the Shepherd's Bride," [...] exhibited part of the tail of Balaam's ass, the helm of Noah's ark, and the tartan plaid in which Flora McDonald wrapped Prince Charlie. More select entertainment, such as Shuffle Kitty's waxwork, whose motto was, [...] "A rag to pay, and in you go," [...] were given in a hall whose approach was by an outside stair. On the Muckle Friday, the fair for which children storing their pocket money would accumulate sevenpence-half-penny in less than six months, the square was crammed with gingerbread stalls, bag-pipers, fiddlers, and monstrosities who were gifted with second sight. There was a bearded man, who had neither legs nor arms, and was drawn through the streets in a small cart by four dogs. By looking at you he could see all the clockwork inside, as could a boy who was led about by his mother at the end of a string. Every Friday there was the market, when a dozen ramshackle carts containing vegetables and cheap crockery filled the centre of the square, resting in line on their shafts. A score of farmers' wives or daughters in old-world garments squatted against the town-house within walls of butter on cabbage-leaves, eggs and chickens. Towards evening the voice of the buckie-man shook the square, and rival fish-cadgers, terrible characters who ran races on horseback, screamed libels at each other over a fruiterer's barrow. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for douce Auld Lichts to go home, draw their stools near the fire, spread their red handkerchiefs over their legs to prevent their trousers getting singed, and read their [...] "Pilgrim's Progress." ...|$|E

5000|$|Their {{debut album}} The Sons of Yesterday's Black Grouse in 2001 got people {{interested}} in the new band. Mannhai started intense touring until the August 2002. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to get back in}} the studio for their second record. With this second album Evil under the Sun Mannhai topped its predecessor. The record includes the classic Mannhai song [...] "Spiritraiser" [...] as well as the video, directed by Tuukka Temonen (former bass player of the Finnish Punk/Hard Core group Apulanta).|$|E
5000|$|At Howard House, Bedford Frank {{had started}} to settle down. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to move to another}} home, so on 21 August 1941 Frank ended up at Kingston-upon-Thame s, which by all {{accounts}} was not a happy time for Frank. On 8 July 1944 he set off for Goldings together with several other boys, which for him {{turned out to be the}} most fearsome establishment, which is recounted in his childhood autobiography Banana Boy (1969). This time at Goldings would stand him in good stead during the time he would spend on [...] "holiday" [...] in prison.|$|E

40|$|Postcolonial {{theory has}} a people problem. By this, I am unabashedly {{suggesting}} that postcolonial theoreticians’ overemphasis on people {{as the site}} of analysis {{lies at the heart of}} the limitations of the field’s key terms, epistemological boundaries, and approach to understanding phenomena as a whole. Indeed, if postcolonial theory and its related concepts and methods are to have any intellectual purchase, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to abandon its anthropocentric approach to explaining how the world works and suggesting how to right humanity’s wrongs in favor of perspectives which acknowledge the solidarity of things and the non-hierarchical nature of life...|$|R
