" The diploma thesis is divided into three parts. The first part describes the theoretical basis of consumer protection in the Czech Republic and the European Union. Sources of legal regulation of consumer law, basic terminology as well as consumer organizations and institutions active in this area are described. The second part deals with the regulation of product safety, while an analysis of three major legislations affecting the product safety is carried out. The third part of this diploma thesis is crucial, while it characterizes the term "toy", analyzes legislation governing <b>toys</b> <b>safety</b> and contains comparison of the current and already invalid Government Regulation on technical requirements for toys. Specific aspects of the toy industry and its current trends are discussed as well as systematic intervention of responsible bodies in case when a dangerous toy is launched...|$|R

40|$|Health and {{environmental}} {{risks associated with}} emissions of hazardous chemicals from articles, including everyday consumer products such as clothes and toys, have become widely acknowledged internationally, particularly in the EU. This thesis contributes to new understandings of how these risks are currently managed within the EU and recommends actions for ensuring a safe and sustainable use of chemicals in articles. Paper I provides an overview and comparative analysis of regulatory strategies for managing risks of chemicals in articles in the EU. The in-depth analysis, which {{is focused on the}} <b>Toys</b> <b>Safety</b> Directive, the RoHS Directive, and REACH, shows that the legislations differ significantly. Differences include e. g. what criteria are used for the selection of substances to be targeted for regulation, and the kind of requirements and restrictions applied to the selected substances. It is concluded that product-specific directives are important complements to REACH in order to ensure a safe use of chemicals in articles. Paper II evaluates to what extent the regulation of chemicals in articles under REACH is coherent with the rules concerning chemicals in the Sewage Sludge Directive (SSD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The results show {{that the majority of the}} chemicals that are prioritized for phase-out under the WFD or for concentration restrictions in sludge and soil under the SSD are allowed to be used in articles according to REACH. In order to avoid end-of-pipe problems and to increase resource efficiency, it is argued that it is necessary to minimize the input of chemicals identified as hazardous to health or the environment into articles. Paper III aims to clarify what the substitution principle means and how it can reasonably be applied as part of chemical policies. A general definition is proposed that gives equal weight to hazard, functionality and economical considerations, while at the same time recognizing that the aim of the substitution principle is to reduce hazards to human health and the environment. This paper also summarizes major methods to promote and implement the principle, discusses legislative approaches with regard to their ability to promote substitution of hazardous chemicals, and makes proposals for an efficient implementation of the principle.

5000|$|In Europe, the {{comprehensive}} legislation addressing <b>toy</b> <b>safety</b> is the <b>Toy</b> <b>Safety</b> Directive of the European Union (EU), (Council Directive 88/378/EEC). This directive {{is a list}} of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective <b>Toy</b> <b>Safety</b> Regulations (e.g.: the UK's Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 (Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 204)). This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the chemical requirements of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a CE Mark, which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment. Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission. [...] Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive. The <b>toy</b> <b>safety</b> directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.The Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 <b>Toy</b> <b>Safety</b> Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.If a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of due diligence (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken {{to ensure the safety of}} the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.|$|E
50|$|Although an {{international}} <b>toy</b> <b>safety</b> standard exists, nations {{around the world}} still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.Current <b>toy</b> <b>safety</b> standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has {{been seen in the}} large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable <b>toy</b> <b>safety</b> standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.|$|E
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) The toy {{industry}} in Hong Kong is facing intense competition on price together with poor returns on investment. In addition, {{social and environmental}} responsibilities of <b>toy</b> firms and <b>safety</b> regulations imposed on toy products are increasing. Facing these challenges, toy manufacturers in Hong Kong must enhance innovation to improve competitiveness. Consequentially, this research examines the relationships between social capital (structural, relational and cognitive), knowledge acquisition and innovation in the toy {{industry in}} Hong Kong. A quantitative approach is used to analyse 200 valid responses from managerial personnel of toy companies in Hong Kong. Data analysis includes descriptive statistics of the participants, their companies and key variables (structural social capital, relational social capital, cognitive social capital, knowledge acquisition and innovation), together with factor analysis, reliability analysis and hypotheses testing of the key variables. The findings indicate that structural social capital and cognitive social capital (but not relational social capital) positively affect knowledge acquisition in the toy industry in Hong Kong. However, relational social capital on its own is a salient contributor of knowledge acquisition. Also knowledge acquisition is found to positively affect innovation. While the findings confirm that knowledge acquisition fully mediates the relationship between structural social capital and innovation, there is only partial mediation of knowledge acquisition {{on the relationship between}} cognitive social capital and innovation. The findings of the research contribute to the theory of social capital, knowledge acquisition and innovation by filling the research gaps and obtaining empirical results for the above variables {{in the context of the}} toy industry in Hong Kong. In addition, there are practical benefits for managers in toy companies in Hong Kong in that external knowledge through network relationships with key customers can be acquired and this benefits innovation.

40|$|This {{research}} examined, in {{an educational}} and developmental framework, expert consensus on toy evaluation criteria. The work {{was aimed at}} discovering a) whether or not experts could concur about the "overall goodness" of toys, and b) whether particular characteristics of <b>toys,</b> namely their <b>safety,</b> durability, play value, educational-developmental value and interpersonal-social value were similarly viewed. [...] The study asked five main questions: 1) Do raters perceive significant differences among the toys? 2) Do Academics and Practitioners rate toys in similar ways 3) Do individual experts agree in their ratings? 4) Is there agreement among {{the two groups of}} raters on the ratings of specific toys? and 5) Are there significant correlations between a) the overall goodness score and the summated variables score and b) the educational developmental value and play value scores? [...] To answer these questions, six academics and six practitioners were asked to rate 62 pictorially presented toys on the six criteria listed above. Ratings were done on a 7 -point Likert-type scale. From these ratings, six criterion variable scores plus one summative score were obtained. [...] While it was found that experts, as a group, concur in their rating of a toy, it was also found that the rating of a single expert may not necessarily be consistent with that of other experts. Post hoc analysis determined that for most variables, four expert's opinions are needed for a reliable rating. [...] Results also suggest that the raters appeared to rate according to two possible factors, one reflecting the toy's construction and the other its use. Other significant trends are also noted. [...] The findings of the study are discussed relative to Schmidt's (1973) views of development and education. Some limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are offered.
