40|$|Milling of steels for {{advanced}} applications entails heavy {{stress on the}} tools, causing premature wear and tool breaking at the entrance or in the initial roughing phase. Micro Abrasive Waterjet (Micro AWJ) is exploited in this study for the roughing operations thanks to its valuable Material Removal Rate and flexibility. A 4 mm wide and 9. 5 mm deep pocket is roughed by Micro AWJ and finished <b>by</b> Micro <b>Milling.</b> The main process parameters effect is discussed and assessed, {{as well as the}} jet trajectory design. The final objective is removing as much material as possible, but still preserving a layer <b>to</b> be <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>milling.</b> The tool wear in case of plain milling and hybrid machining is inspected, discussing the hybrid solution convenience...|$|R

25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>milling.</b> The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|R
