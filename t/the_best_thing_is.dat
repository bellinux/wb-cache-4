500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} song is of [...] "equal caliber to its predecessor , with a one-listen hook, elegant chug-along melody, a lyric about healing and Lewis' unquestionably emotive vocal versatility". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "love takes time' rumination", and along with another song of the album ("I Will Be"), described it as [...] "predictable". Sean Fennessey for Vibe noted that the track [...] "is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> , <b>is</b> mannered and takes nearly three minutes {{to get off the}} ground". It ranked at number four on the [...] "10 Best Singles of 2008" [...] list by American magazine Entertainment Weekly. [...] "Better in Time" [...] was nominated at the 2009 BRIT Awards in the category of Best British Single, and later the song was included on the awards' compilation album.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of the suitors' patronage, Iro {{commits suicide}} after a doleful {{monologue}} ("O grief, O torment that saddens the soul!") Melanto, whose lover Eurimaco was killed with the suitors, tries to warn Penelope {{of the new}} danger represented by the unidentified slayer, but Penelope is unmoved and continues to mourn for Ulisse. Eumete and Telemaco now inform her that the beggar was Ulisse in disguise, but she refuses to believe them: [...] "Your news is persistent and your comfort hurtful." [...] The scene briefly transfers to the heavens, where Giunone, having been solicited by Minerva, persuades Giove and Nettune that Ulisse should be restored to his throne. Back in the palace the nurse Ericlea has discovered Ulisse's identity by recognising a scar on his back, but does not immediately reveal this information: [...] "Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a wise silence." [...] Penelope continues to disbelieve, even when Ulisse appears in his true form and when Ericlea reveals her knowledge of the scar. Finally, after Ulisse describes the pattern of Penelope's private bedlinen, knowledge that only he could possess, she is convinced. Reunited, the pair sing rapturously to celebrate their love: [...] "My sun, long sighed for! My light, renewed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Suggestions were made, despite initial {{skepticism}} on {{the part}} of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play. Within several days, Ricordi approached Verdi with the request that he would like to visit Sant' Agata [...] "with a friend" [...] in September. Verdi's reaction was clearly non-committal: [...] "I wish absolutely to avoid committing myself [...] <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> ... <b>is</b> for him to send me the finished poem".|$|E
60|$|He {{thought of}} the moody, well-dressed young man, {{with whom he had}} {{exchanged}} glances in the crowd around the bandstand, and who, he felt confident, was the robber.

50|$|The Tsesarevich could {{refer to}} these results as {{confirmation}} of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to recover {{as quickly as possible}} from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization.

60|$|I. For {{the first}} of these, that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> yet behind, and in {{reversion}} for believers; this is manifest by the natural exercise of this grace. For 'hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it' (Rom 8:24,25). Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that <b>the</b> believer's <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> behind in reversion.|$|R

"He had," [...] he said, when he {{recovered}} consciousness, [...] "heard a tremendous fire going on, {{and as soon}} as he could collect his thoughts became assured that the enemy must be attacking the village.

6000|$|... "It was {{the most}} crying scandal of the Pacific," [...] exclaimed Davidson vehemently. [...] "The missionaries had been {{agitating}} against it for years, and at last the local press took it up. The police refused to stir. You know their argument. They say that vice is inevitable and consequently <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to localise and control it. The truth is, they were paid. Paid.

"Not often, lad, {{either to}} man or horse, though I have known horses die {{when they have}} been bit in the head when they have been grazing. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to tie a bandage tightly above the place, and to clap on a {{poultice}} of fresh dung--that draws out the poison; and then, if you have got it, drink half a bottle of spirits.

"That {{may make}} me feel badly tomorrow, Josie," [...] laughed Anne, [...] "but just now I {{honestly}} feel {{that as long as}} I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers' Lane, it's not a great deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not. I've done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the 'joy of the strife.' Next to trying and winning, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> trying and failing.

But why on earth you should go and marry, seeing that you're not the eldest son, and that you've got everything on earth that you want as a bachelor, I can't understand. I can't indeed, Fred. By heaven, I can't!" [...] Then Sir Anthony gave a long sigh, and sat musing awhile, thinking of the club in London to which he belonged, but which he never entered;--of the old days {{in which he had}} been master of a bedroom near St. James's Street,--of his old friends whom he never saw now, and of whom he never heard, except as one and another, year after year, shuffled away from their wives to that world {{in which there is no}} marrying or giving in marriage.

6000|$|December 30th.--I {{have had}} nothing to do with the [...] "ceremonies." [...] In fact I believe there have hardly been any--no midnight mass at the Sistine chapel, no silver {{trumpets}} at St. Peter's. Everything is remorselessly clipped and curtailed--the Vatican in deepest mourning. But I saw it in its superbest scarlet in '69.... I went yesterday with L. to the Colonna gardens--an adventure that would have reconverted me to Rome if the thing weren't already done. It's a rare old place--rising in mouldy bosky terraces and mossy stairways and winding walks from the back of the palace to the top of the Quirinal. It's the grand style of gardening, and resembles the present natural manner as a chapter of Johnsonian rhetoric resembles a piece of clever contemporary journalism. But it's a better style in horticulture than in literature; I prefer one of the long-drawn blue-green Colonna vistas, with a maimed and mossy-coated garden goddess at the end, to the finest possible quotation from a last-century classic. Perhaps the best thing there is the old orangery with its trees in fantastic terra-cotta tubs. The late afternoon light was gilding the monstrous jars and suspending golden chequers among the golden-fruited leaves. Or perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the broad terrace with its mossy balustrade and its benches; also its view of the great naked Torre di Nerone (I think), which might look stupid if the rosy brickwork didn't take such a colour in the blue air. Delightful, at any rate, to stroll and talk there in the afternoon sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|Phineas {{had never}} seen his horse till he reached the meet, and there found a fine-looking, very strong, bay animal, with {{shoulders}} like {{the top of a}} hay-stack, short-backed, short-legged, with enormous quarters, and a wicked-looking eye. [...] "He ought to be strong," [...] said Phineas to the groom. [...] "Oh, sir; strong ain't no word for him," [...] said the groom; [...] "'e can carry a 'ouse." [...] "I don't know whether he's fast?" [...] inquired Phineas. [...] "He's fast enough for any 'ounds, sir," [...] said the man with that tone of assurance which always carries conviction. [...] "And he can jump?" [...] "He can jump!" [...] continued the groom; [...] "no 'orse in my lord's stables can't beat him." [...] "But he won't?" [...] said Phineas. [...] "It's only sometimes, sir, and then <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to stick him at it till he do. He'll go, he will, like a shot at last; and then he's right for the day." [...] Hunting men will know that all this was not quite comfortable. When you ride your own horse, and know his special defects, you know also how far that defect extends, and what real prospect you have of overcoming it. If he be slow through the mud, you keep a good deal on the road in heavy weather, and resolve that the present is not an occasion for distinguishing yourself. If he be bad at timber, you creep through a hedge. If he pulls, you get as far from the crowd as may be. You gauge your misfortune, and make your little calculation as to the best mode of remedying the evil. But when you are told that your friend's horse is perfect,--only that he does this or that,--there comes a weight on your mind from which you are unable to release it. You cannot discount your trouble at any percentage. It may amount to absolute ruin, as far as that day is concerned; and in such a circumstance you always look forward to the worst. When the groom had done his description, Phineas Finn would almost have preferred a day's canvass at Tankerville under Mr. Ruddles's authority to his present position.|$|E
60|$|O God, Thou knowest, and Thou alone, how far I am right, {{and how far}} wrong. I leave {{myself in}} Thy hand, certain that Thou wilt deal fairly, justly, lovingly with me, as a Father with his son. I do not pretend {{to be better than}} I am; neither will I pretend to be worse than I am. Truly I know nothing about it. I, ignorant human being that I am, can never fully know how far I am right, and how far wrong. I find light and {{darkness}} fighting together in my heart, and I cannot divide between them. But Thou, Lord, canst. Thou knowest. Thou hast made me; Thou lovest me; Thou hast sent Thy Son into the world to make me what I ought to be. Thou wiliest not that I should perish, but come to the knowledge of the truth; and therefore I believe that I shall not perish, but come to the knowledge of the truth about Thee, about my own character, my own duty, about everything which it is needful for me to know. Therefore, O Lord, I will go boldly on, doing my duty as well as I can, though not perfectly, day by day; and asking Thee day by day to feed my soul with daily bread. Thou feedest my body with daily bread. How much more wilt Thou feed my mind and my heart, more precious by far than my body. Lord, I will trust Thee for soul and body alike; and if I need correcting for my sins, I know this, at least, that the worst thing that can happen to me, or to any man, is to do wrong and not to be corrected; and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to be set right, even by hard blows, as often as I stray out of the way. Therefore, O Lord, I will take my punishment quietly and manfully, and try to thank Thee for it, as I ought; for I know that Thou wilt not punish me beyond what I deserve, but far below what I deserve. I know Thou wilt punish me only to bring me to myself, and to correct me, and purge me, and strengthen me. I believe, O Lord, on the warrant of Thine own word I believe it--undeserved as the honour is, that Thou art my Father, and lovest me; Thou dost not afflict any man willingly, or grieve the children of men out of passion or out of spite. Thou wiliest not that I, or any man, should perish; but Thou wiliest have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, for Jesus Christ His sake.|$|E
