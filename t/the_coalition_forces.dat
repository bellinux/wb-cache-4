5|$|While {{the actual}} pitched battle was short, the French infantry, under Marshal Marmont, {{and most of}} all the cavalry, under General Emmanuel de Grouchy, {{launched}} a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy. Retreating in slow-moving square formations in broad daylight and along some excellent cavalry terrain, <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces</b> suffered very heavy losses, with several squares broken by the French cavalry. At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march in order to take his remaining forces to safety.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria.

Although <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces</b> achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces</b> {{launched}} attack after {{attack on}} the villages which were stubbornly defended by the French. Meanwhile, Austrian cavalry charges were highly effective in the open ground between the settlements. After bitter fighting in which Oberwinden and Racour changed hands repeatedly, the two villages and Neerwinden were recaptured by Clerfayt's troops. An Austrian cavalry charge pressed back the French even farther. Dumouriez attempted one more all-out attack with his right but it failed. The French cavalry covered the retreat of the infantry, with Chartres and Valence maintaining a position along the Little Gete.|$|E
5|$|The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna, {{with the}} French in close pursuit. A Russian army under Gen.

5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1794, war {{continued}} in the Rhineland, with General Louis Desaix pushing back <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces.</b> Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th Dragoon Regiment, with General Delmas de La Coste as commander. The brigade performed well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions {{at the end of}} May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in several well-led cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander who knew how to drill his men effectively.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pilnitz threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the coalition army {{when most of}} it had crossed the Kalka River. The Mongols appear to have caught <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>forces</b> by surprise in a fast transition from horse archer fire to massed cavalry charges, because the coalition rout began incredibly quickly: the Rus forces {{bringing up the rear}} had not yet arrived on the battle by the time the front ranks were dissolving. The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat. However, the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap and also enveloped them. The army of Chernigov, which was not aware that the battle had started, was advancing when they collided head-on with the retreating Cumans. Using smoke bombs to disrupt the coalition's ability to coordinate, the Mongol cavalry took advantage of the confusion in the Chernigov line and attacked, causing the line to collapse. This, in turn, led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov.|$|E

5|$|The debacle in Russia {{loosened}} the French {{grip on the}} German princes. In 1813, Napoleon {{mounted a}} campaign in the German states {{to bring them back}} into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces</b> to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key building block of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|With the Grande Armée in full retreat, another {{dangerous}} situation occurred on 29 October. With Bavaria now {{also in the}} camp of the Coalition, an Austro-Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General Karl Philipp von Wrede, who had fought {{under the command of}} the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival of the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces.</b> Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable. During the ensuing Battle of Hanau, Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past and the sight of the fearsome Bearskins of French Guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian grand battery upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General Le Noury's artillery in battery and brought in support General Drouot with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe radio controlled {{improvised explosive device}} (RCIED) {{is one of the}} deadliest threats to military personnel supporting the global war on terrorism, and due to its success is expected {{to play a major role}} as a weapon of choice in future insurgencies. To mitigate the risk of a RCIED attack, electronic jamming devices are utilized to interrupt the communications between a remote control and the RCIED trigger. We consider two approaches to determine the optimal jamming strategy for <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>force.</b> First, we formulate a mixed integer program to find the optimal jamming strategy based on recent attack data of RCIEDs. Second, we formulate a two-person zero-sum game to determine the optimal mixed strategy for jamming. With a simulation study, we found that with the first approach <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>force</b> tends to be overly optimistic in predicting the outcome, and is likely to underperform. In addition, the first approach allows the possibility for smart insurgents to deploy RCIEDs to purposely mislead <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>force</b> on what they plan to do in the future.
