Usually, the work is done over a special dissipative <b>table</b> <b>mat,</b> which allows a very slow discharge, and under an air gush of ioniser.|$|E

50|$|Bentos regained {{popularity}} in the 1980s, {{with the help of}} the microwave oven and the proliferation of convenience stores. In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most bento shops with inexpensive, disposable polystyrene boxes. However, even handmade bentos have made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at Japanese schools. Bentos are still used by workers as a packed lunch, by families on day trips, for school picnics and sports days etc. The bento, made at home, is wrapped in a furoshiki cloth, which acts as both bag and <b>table</b> <b>mat.</b>|$|E

The angle of the shot is particularly crucial, as profiles have little impact and full frontals tend to flatten the features. The direction and intensity of the subject's gaze is also key. Che is looking past the camera, out to his vision. His line of vision has been much tinkered with by various artists, but it retains its passion even on a <b>table</b> <b>mat</b> or a screensaver.

The noblemen took great care in organizing feasts. A popular decoration on the festive table was a swan and many different kinds of meat. It is well known that many kings and noblemen suffered from gout, a typical royal disease. It was caused by the over consumption of meat. At that time, a lot of meat was eaten. Whether it was pork, venison, pheasant or beef, it was all eaten up. The etiquette of the time permitted eating with hands. Most of the time a piece of bread was dipped into gravy or it was used as a <b>table</b> <b>mat</b> under a piece of meat. When they finished eating, the greasy bread was thrown to the dogs.

During lunch Alain is designing several gadgets on a <b>table</b> <b>mat</b> and Manise is drinking coffee, he leaves the bar and says goodbye to everyone at the bar in a very French fashion which catches Alain's attention. Manise goes back to Alain's office and poses as a policeman from the financial branch, insinuating that Alain is involved in some questionable businesses, which Claire denies, however he manages to take a lock of Claire's hair without her noticing. On his way out he crosses Alain who is puzzled {{to see him again}} and asks Clair who he was and she says that he was a copying-machine representative. Alain sits at his desk and notices that things are not exactly where he left them and asks Claire to retrieve his newspaper, which he forgot at the bar. When she leaves he redials the last phone and sees that Claire was not talking to her mother but to Cécile. He also notices that Manise is still outside and manages to shake his tail, then he rushes home turning the house upside down looking for something and finds Cécile's notes on him, he changes his will: nothing for Cécile or Claire, all for the children with a warning not to trust their mother.|$|E

40|$|Improvements {{in memory}} speeds have not {{kept pace with}} {{increasing}} processor clock frequency and improved exploitation of instruction-level parallelism. Consequently, the gap between processor and memory speeds is expected to grow. The increased memory latency seen by the processor not only increases the number of execution cycles spent waiting for memory accesses to complete, but can also degrade the compiler-generated instruction schedule. One solution to this growing problem {{is to reduce the}} number of cache misses by increasing the e ectiveness of the cache hierarchy. In this paper we present a technique for dynamic analysis of program data access behavior, which is then used to proactively guide the placement of data within the cache hierarchy in a location-sensitive manner. Weintroduce the concept of a macroblock, which allows us to feasibly characterize the memory locations accessed by a program, and a Memory Address <b>Table</b> (<b>MAT),</b> which performs the dynamic reference analysis. Our technique is fully compatible with existing Instruction Set Architectures. Results from detailed simulations of several integer programs show signi cant speedups. ...|$|E

40|$|Software-Defined Networking (SDN) switch {{vendors are}} {{interested}} in extending switch data planes to support new and continuously evolving network protocols (e. g., NVGRE, VXLAN). Numerous commercial programmable data plane devices already enable a pro-grammer to specify {{various aspects of the}} data plane including packet parsing, actions, and the layout of packet processing on the hardware device itself. Unlike OpenFlow-based devices, which only expose a series of fixed match-action <b>table</b> (<b>MAT)</b> abstraction, these specialized devices provide a more flexible abstraction for packet processing. Despite the increased programmability that these devices offer, however, the architecture of the target restricts the features that can be exposed to the programmer. Similarly, existing languages for programming the data planes in such devices (e. g., P 4) assume a specific computational model, resembling the architecture of the device for which they are targeted for. Unfortunately, this model leads to similar limitations as in OpenFlow, where the high-level specification is coupled to the underlying device model. In this paper, we introduce NetASM, an intermediate representa-tion for programmable data planes. NetASM is a device-independent language that is expressive enough to act as the target language for compilers for high-level languages, yet low-level enough to be effi-ciently assembled on various device architectures. It enables conven-tional compiler optimization techniques to significantly improve the performance and resource utilization of custom packet-processing pipelines on a variety of targets...|$|E

In fact, in order to promote paper-tearing skills, he made a lot of effort to decrease the number of steps and have fun at the same time, so that even a two-year-old child can both learn and enjoy making them. He usually uses recycled paper for his artwork in the hopes of protecting the environment and making paper-tearing popularized. For instance, he teaches children to use <b>table</b> <b>mats</b> of fast food shops to make paper-tearing works; therefore, children can make artwork without wasting paper.|$|R
