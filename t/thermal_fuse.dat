25|$|On November 15, 2013, a fire {{broke out}} in an Irvine, California garage where a Tesla Model S was plugged in and charging. The fire appears to have {{originated}} at the wall connection where the Tesla charging equipment was plugged in. Shortly afterwards, Tesla updated the Model S firmware to reduce charging current when power fluctuations were detected and replaced wall adapters with a new unit containing a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> {{is often}} found in {{consumer}} equipment such as coffee makers, hair dryers or transformers powering small consumer electronics devices. [...] They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the surrounding temperature gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device {{can be used to}} prevent a fire in a hair dryer for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the blower motor stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a 'one shot', non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).|$|E
50|$|Oil heaters {{have been}} known to explode when their <b>thermal</b> <b>fuses</b> fail to shut them off. This can cause fire, thick black smoke, {{unpleasant}} odors, oil on walls and other surfaces, and disfiguring scalding.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>fuses</b> {{are usually}} found in heat-producing {{electrical}} appliances such as coffeemakers and hair dryers. They function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the heating element {{in case of}} a malfunction (such as a defective thermostat) that would otherwise allow the temperature to rise to dangerous levels, possibly starting a fire.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electronic}} components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as <b>thermal</b> <b>fuses,</b> circuit breakers, or PTC current limiters.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} noted {{regarding}} behavior of transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under over-voltage conditions. Depending {{on the level of}} conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically, keeping the load connected, but now without any surge protection. [...] A user may have no indication when the surge suppressor has failed. Under the right conditions of over-voltage and line impedance, {{it may be possible to}} cause the MOV to burst into flames, the root cause of many fires and the main reason for NFPA’s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, resulting in the opening of a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> is {{a cutoff}} {{which uses a}} {{one-time}} fusible link. Unlike a thermal switch which may automatically reset itself when the temperature drops, the <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> is more like an electrical fuse: a single-use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered. A <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> is used when the overheating {{is a result of}} a rare occurrence, such as failure requiring repair (which would also replace the fuse) or replacement at the end of service life.|$|E

40|$|Health {{diagnostics}} is an {{area where}} major improvements have been identified for potential implementation into the design of new reusable launch vehicles in order to reduce life cycle costs, to increase safety margins, and to improve mission reliability. NASA Ames is leading the effort to develop inspection and health management technologies for thermal protection systems. This paper summarizes a joint project between NASA Ames and SRI International to develop 'SensorTags,' radio frequency identification devices coupled with event-recording sensors, that can be embedded in the thermal protection system to monitor temperature or other quantities of interest. Two prototype SensorTag designs containing <b>thermal</b> <b>fuses</b> to indicate a temperature overlimit are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|These {{features}} are required because the negative electrode produces heat during use, while the positive electrode may produce oxygen. However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to {{nickel metal hydride}} batteries, which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve. Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied {{to all kinds of}} cells, e.g. prismatic high current cells cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt. High current cells must not produce excessive heat or oxygen, lest there be a failure, possibly violent. Instead, they must be equipped with internal <b>thermal</b> <b>fuses</b> which act before the anode and cathode reach their thermal limits.|$|R
50|$|The {{main product}} of the company is {{multilevel}} float switch, a cable-suspended control device which tilts as the liquid level rises or falls. Kari-Finn Oy announces that based on its own market research, Kari float switch is the only product on the market that makes possible many functions with just one switch. This product was invented by {{the founder of the}} company, an inventor and an engineer, Mauno Kari. Besides the main product, Kari-Finn Oy produces also many other electrical devices, such as electrode switches based on conductiveness of liquid, silo switches made for surface level control for loose storage items, optical level controllers for potentially explosive environments, temperature based <b>thermal</b> <b>fuses,</b> watertight pump cable connectors and alarm and control units for pumping stations. In year 2008 the company manufactured over 50.000 float switches.|$|R
50|$|When used {{in power}} applications, MOVs usually are thermal fused or {{otherwise}} protected to avoid persistent short circuits and other fire hazards. In a typical power strip, the visible circuit breaker {{is distinct from}} the internal <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> which is not normally visible to the end user. The circuit breaker has no function related to disconnecting an MOV. A <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> or some equivalent solution protects from MOV generated hazards.|$|E
50|$|A series {{connected}} <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> is {{one solution}} to catastrophic MOV failure. Varistors with internal thermal protection are also available.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> {{a thermal}} switch is usually reusable, and is {{therefore}} suited to protecting against temporary situations which are common and user-correctable. Thermal switches are used in power supplies in case of overload, and also as thermostats in some heating and cooling systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} electrode {{design has}} been devised for drug discovery pharmacology, neural interface systems, cell-based biosensors and electrophysiology research, based on high volume CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit technology. The electrode is {{formed by the}} anodisation of CMOS metallisation to form nanoporous alumina. The process was developed to address the concern of aluminium neurotoxicity, improve corrosion resistance under physiological conditions and to present a preferential morpohology for cell-substrate adhesion. Thin-film anodisation is optimised to overcome problems of <b>thermal</b> <b>fusing,</b> enabling a variety of substrate morphologies to be produced using potentials of 10 - 100 V. Current density scaling factors are shown to confirm the suitability of CMOS circuit geometries to the anodisation process. Corrosion tests demonstrate improved corrosion performance of the porous alumina electrode. The process and scaling factors are validated by anodisation of a simple CMOS device...|$|R
40|$|The use of CNG in bus {{and private}} {{vehicles}} is growing steadily. Recent fire accidents involving CNG buses {{have shown that}} tanks may explode though compliant with current ECE UN R 110 regulation.

Investigation of German and French recent cases detailed in this article highlights potential improvements in current CNG buses fire safety concepts. Among others, it includes {{to rely on a}} system-level test and expectations in combination with the current component-level test. Fire safety should not solely rely on tank behaviour when exposed to fire but also to additional and upstream fire safety barriers. <b>Thermal</b> <b>fuses</b> can not be seen any more as an ultimate option to control tank burst in case of fire...|$|R

50|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against electrical transients, a varistor with a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway {{and sometimes a}} small explosion or fire. To prevent this, the fault current is typically limited by a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.|$|E
50|$|MOVs {{are often}} {{connected}} {{in series with}} a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> so that the fuse disconnects before catastrophic failure can happen. When this happens, only the MOV is disconnected. A failing MOV is a fire risk, which is {{a reason for the}} National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998, 2009 and 2015. NFPA's primary concern is protection from fire.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the removal of the}} insulating ligands surrounding the particles, the <b>thermal</b> treatment partially <b>fuses</b> the gold and TiO 2 particles, resulting in the partial embedding of gold nanoparticles into the titanium dioxide structure. The fusion of the particles is expected to lead to an enhanced injection of hot electrons when illuminated at the plasmonic frequency. This effect is partially responsible for the increased plasmonic current which is observed.|$|R
5000|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected {{directly across}} an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which {{has developed a}} lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire. [...] To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.|$|E
50|$|The next picture {{shows the}} two {{overheat}} cutouts. The bimetal cutout (left) operates if the device overheats because the intake is blocked or the fan fails, and resets once the heater cools after the obstruction is removed. The <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> (right) is a failsafe backup device that will disconnect the heating element permanently {{in case of}} extreme overheating causing risk of fire, usually because the bimetal switch fails to operate (e.g. due to its contacts welding together).|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{electrical}} fuses {{or circuit}} breakers, thermal fuses only react to excessive temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse</b> itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|E
40|$|Microfabrication {{technology}} has enabled traditional {{chemical and biological}} research to be performed at the micrometer scale, but the control of particles suspended in fluids and the fluids themselves remain a significant challenge. This dissertation is aimed at developing simple and versatile control systems for fluids and small entities (e. g., particles and molecules) in fluids. Accordingly, three methods have been explored using electric and fluidic micromanipulation, {{as well as physical}} deposition. First, dielectrophoretic DNA positioning and elongation in a microchannel have been examined with modified surface chemistry and electrode conditions. Less hydrophilic surfaces provided more controllable stretching, presumably due to the decreased non-specific adsorption of DNA on these surfaces compared to their more hydrophilic counterparts. Smoothed electrode edges allowed more controlled stretching, and, moreover, thin electrodes (50 nm) provided dense electric field and gave ~ 90 % success rate of DNA stretching. Second, a microstencil method has been developed to pattern thermally and chemically sensitive materials. The microstencil has a bi-layer structure comprised of two polymeric films (i. e., parylene and SU 8). The parylene layer enables the microstencil to be mechanically peeled from hydrophilic substrates and SU 8 provides height to control the amount of material deposited. The amount is also controlled externally by performing multiple spin or dip coating processes. As an initial demonstration of the method, a wide range of chemically and thermally labile materials has been patterned: wax, cells, and proteins. Third, a continuous synthesis system for anisotropic microparticles with different shapes and sequences has been developed. The anisotropic particles are configured by exploiting a combination of geometrical confinement and microfluidics to pack particles into a narrow, terminal channel, and the packed particles are then bonded by <b>thermal</b> <b>fusing.</b> The width and length of the channels reproducibly specify the configuration of the anisotropic particles that will be produced. Complex sequences are obtained by coupling the sequential actuation of metering lines with the input flow of different particles. By using the process, linear and triangular homogeneous (A) and heterogeneous (A-B and A-B-A) particle chains have been synthesized...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{sensitivity}} of Fiber Specklegram Sensors to high temperatures (up to 800 ºC) have been studied. Two multimode silica fibers have been introduced into a tubular furnace while a HeNe laser source was launched into a fiber edge, projecting speckle patterns to a commercial webcam. A computer generated different heating and cooling sweeps while the specklegram evolution was recorded. The achieved results exhibit a remarkably linearity in FSS’s sensitivity for temperatures under 800 ºC, following the <b>thermal</b> expansion of <b>fused</b> silica.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} the physics of high energy plasmas is to understand the stability and transport properties of a self organized <b>thermal</b> D-T <b>fusing</b> plasma under conditions where the heating by the fusion produced particles, with multi-MeV energies, can compensate all forms of energy loss. The Columbus device is proposed as one component of a spectrum of experiments that are needed to explore the physics of fusion burning plasmas up to these (ignition) conditions. Columbus, which has a larger volume than Ignitor [1] by about 50 %, preserves the ability to confine, under macroscopically stable conditions, plasmas with peak pressures exceeding 3 MPa, corresponding to ignition at central plasma densities around 1021 nuclei/m 3 and to reach this regime by ohmic heating alone. In particular, the Columbus program is proposed as a U. S. counterpart to the Ignitor program conducted in Italy and to be complementary to it. The machine costs and its development can be minimized by incorporating the main engineering solutions devised for Ignitor and {{taking advantage of the}} results of the R&D effort that has been carried out already. The main difference between Columbus and Ignitor is in the magnet and plasm...|$|R
50|$|If a {{surge current}} is so {{excessively}} large as {{to exceed the}} MOV parameters and blow the <b>thermal</b> <b>fuse,</b> then a light found on some protectors would indicate unacceptable failure. Even adequately sized MOV protectors will eventually degrade beyond acceptable limits, {{with or without a}} failure light indication. Therefore, all MOV-based protectors intended for long-term use should have an indicator that the protective components have failed, and this indication must be checked on a regular basis to insure that protection is still functioning.|$|E

5000|$|Fused quartz or {{fused silica}} is glass {{consisting}} of silica in amorphous (non-crystalline) form. It differs from traditional glasses in containing no other ingredients, which are typically added to glass {{to lower the}} melt temperature. Although the terms quartz and fused silica are used interchangeably, the fundamental structures and creation of each glass differ. Fused silica, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures. The optical and <b>thermal</b> properties of <b>fused</b> quartz are superior {{to those of other}} types of glass due to its purity. For these reasons, it finds use in situations such as semiconductor fabrication and laboratory equipment. It transmits ultraviolet better than other glasses, so is used to make lenses and optics for the ultraviolet spectrum.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{infrared thermography}} and 3 -D digital image correlation (TDIC) technique {{has been developed}} which allows for simultaneous measurement of spatial and temporal distributions of temperatures and displacements. For this, a novel technique was developed to calibrate the IR thermal cameras with a stereo-vision digital image correlation (DIC) system using the standard pin-hole stereo calibration model. This method <b>fuses</b> <b>thermal</b> and displacement information and compensates for the difference in camera resolutions. Several high temperature black and white paints were evaluated to determine their characteristics including the temperature-dependent emissivity of each paint, the mixed emissivity of both paints in the speckle pattern, and optical thickness.

Thermal conductivity of the fused silica agreed with Birch's data in temperature range from the room temperature to 500 ℃. The conductivity of the crystalline quartz {{is found to be}} higher than Birch's values in α-quartz range. It is found that the conductivities in the X and C axis of the crystalline quartz are inverted at the transition point of the α- and β-quartz. The phonon part of the conductivities of rocks differs considerably for different specimens. It is confirmed that the conductivities of all the measured rocks increase with temperature at temperatures higher than 1200 ℃. This phenomenon indicates that radiative or excitonic effect becomes important at high temperatures. 溶融石英,石英,かんらん岩,オリビンノジュール,ダンかんらん岩の熱伝導率をKingeryの方法を改良して室温から約 1400 ℃の温度範囲で測定した. 溶融石英の熱伝導率は温度上昇と共に一様に増加する...|$|R
