25|$|Between 1540 and 1559, 8.9 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of Antioquia is attributable to the Basque immigration and Basque character traits. Few Colombians of distant Basque descent are aware of their Basque ethnic heritage. In Bogota, there is a small colony of thirty to forty families who emigrated {{as a consequence of the}} Spanish Civil War or because of different opportunities. Basque priests were the ones that introduced handball into Colombia. Basque immigrants in Colombia were devoted <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> public administration. In the first years of the Andean multinational company, Basque sailors navigated as captains and pilots on the majority of the ships until the country was able to train its own crews.|$|E
25|$|Following their marriage, Ward and his {{new wife}} {{returned}} to Chicago where he began work on his next major play, Our Lan' in 1941. The outbreak of World War II, however, delayed the play's first production and, in the interim, Ward was forced to take on odd jobs to support his new family. After brief stints as a factory laborer, a bootblack, and {{a writer for the}} Office of War Information, Ward eventually returned <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> helped to create several adult writing seminars that he led in Chicago and New Orleans. After the war's end, Ward was finally able to begin publicizing his play about the Reconstruction Era of the United States South. The script earned him a prestigious Theatre Guild Award in 1945 and managed to generate enough interest for the work to premiere at the Henry Street Settlement Playhouse in 1947 and, after a successful showing, transferred to Broadway’s Royale Theatre for 42 performances. Although Our Lan had a relatively short run, the play's premiere on Broadway distinguished Ward {{as one of the few}} black writers that was able to get work produced on Broadway following the end of the Harlem Renaissance.|$|E
