5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a <b>thermocouple</b> material.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for <b>thermocouple</b> tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E

When deposited in thin-film form, ceramic <b>thermocouples</b> offer advantages over precious-metal (based, variously, on platinum or rhodium) <b>thermocouples</b> that are typically used in gas turbines. Ceramic <b>thermocouples</b> exhibit high melting temperatures, chemical stability at high temperatures, and little or no electromigration.

25|$|A <b>thermocouple</b> {{can produce}} current to drive some {{processes}} directly, {{without the need}} for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a <b>thermocouple</b> can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a <b>thermocouple</b> is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the <b>thermocouple</b> tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the Peltier effect).|$|E
25|$|A <b>thermocouple</b> {{produces}} small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low {{input offset voltage}} and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the <b>thermocouple</b> wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in <b>thermocouple</b> instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at <b>thermocouple</b> junctions.|$|E

25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a <b>thermocouple</b> in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the <b>thermocouple</b> {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the <b>thermocouple</b> remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the <b>thermocouple</b> temperature falls, causing the voltage across the <b>thermocouple</b> to drop and the valve to close.|$|E

25|$|A <b>thermocouple</b> is an {{electrical}} device {{consisting of two}} dissimilar electrical conductors forming electrical junctions at differing temperatures.

40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature, failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed <b>thermocouples</b> is commonly encountered. To understand and remediate this problem, out-ofpile tests were performed with <b>thermocouples</b> in carburizing atmospheres {{which can be}} assumed {{to be at least}} locally representative for High Temperature Reactors. The objective was to screen those <b>thermocouples</b> which would consecutively be used under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed with a set of <b>thermocouples</b> embedded in graphite (mainly conventional Type N <b>thermocouples</b> and <b>thermocouples</b> with innovative sheaths) in a dedicated furnace with helium flushing. Performance indicators such as thermal drift, insulation and loop resistance were monitored and compared to those from conventional Type N <b>thermocouples.</b> Several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, thickness, sheath composition, temperature as well as the chemical environment. After the tests, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examinations were performed to analyze possible local damage in wires and in the sheath. The present paper describes the two experiments, summarizes results and outlines further work, in particular to further analyze the findings and to select suitable <b>thermocouples</b> for qualification under irradiation.

30|$|For simplicity, reliability, and {{relatively}} low cost, <b>thermocouples</b> are widely used.

25|$|Types B, R, and S <b>thermocouples</b> use {{platinum}} or a platinum/rhodium alloy {{for each}} conductor. These {{are among the}} most stable <b>thermocouples,</b> but have lower sensitivity than other types, approximately 10µV/°C.

40|$|Temperatures of {{hot section}} {{components}} in today’s gas turbine engines reach {{as high as}} 1, 500 °C, making in situ monitoring of the severe temperature gradients within the engine rather difficult. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop instrumentation (i. e., <b>thermocouples</b> and strain gauges) for these turbine engines that can survive these harsh environments. Refractory metal and ceramic thin film <b>thermocouples</b> are well suited for this task since they have excellent chemical and electrical stability at high temperatures in oxidizing atmospheres, they are compatible with thermal barrier coatings commonly employed in today’s engines, they have greater sensitivity than conventional wire <b>thermocouples,</b> and they are non-invasive to combustion aerodynamics in the engine. Thin film <b>thermocouples</b> based on platinum:palladium and indium oxynitride:indium tin oxynitride as well as their oxide counterparts have been developed for this purpose and have proven to be more stable than conventional type-S and type-K thin film <b>thermocouples.</b> The metallic and ceramic thin film <b>thermocouples</b> described within this paper exhibited remarkable stability and drift rates similar to bulk (wire) <b>thermocouples...</b>|$|R
25|$|Commercial <b>thermocouples</b> are inexpensive, interchangeable, are {{supplied}} with standard connectors, and can measure {{a wide range}} of temperatures. In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, <b>thermocouples</b> are self powered and require no external form of excitation. The main limitation with <b>thermocouples</b> is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree Celsius (°C) can be difficult to achieve.|$|R
25|$|A common {{error in}} <b>thermocouple</b> {{construction}} {{is related to}} cold junction compensation. If an error is made on the estimation of , the same error will be carried over to the temperature measurement. For the simplest measurements, <b>thermocouple</b> wires are connected to copper {{far away from the}} hot or cold point whose temperature is measured; the cold junction is then assumed to be, at room temperature, but that temperature can vary.|$|E
25|$|Thermocouples {{are often}} used at high {{temperatures}} and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by <b>thermocouple</b> aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a <b>thermocouple</b> {{that is used to}} measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the <b>thermocouple</b> circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the <b>thermocouple</b> concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot <b>thermocouple</b> activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single <b>thermocouple.</b> Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a <b>thermocouple</b> is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermocouples</b> and thermopiles are {{devices that}} use the Seebeck effect to measure the {{temperature}} difference between two objects. <b>Thermocouples</b> are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently (cold junction compensation).

40|$|Thin film <b>thermocouples</b> {{provide a}} {{minimally}} intrusive means of measuring surface temperature in hostile, high temperature environments. Unlike wire <b>thermocouples,</b> thin films do not necessitate any machining of the surface, therefore leaving intact its structural integrity. Thin films are many {{orders of magnitude}} thinner than wire, resulting in less disruption to the gas flow and thermal patterns {{that exist in the}} operating environment. Thin film <b>thermocouples</b> have been developed for surface temperature measurement on a variety of engine materials. The sensors are fabricated in the NASA Lewis Research Center's Thin Film Sensor Lab, which is a class 1000 clean room.

Thin film-to-leadwire connections are made using the parallel-gap welding process. <b>Thermocouples</b> have been developed for use on superalloys, ceramics and ceramic composites, and intermetallics. Some applications of thin film <b>thermocouples</b> are: temperature measurement of space shuttle main engine turbine blade materials, temperature measurement in gas turbine engine testing of advanced materials, and temperature and heat flux measurements in a diesel engine.

25|$|Chemical {{production}} and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures {{associated with a}} process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of <b>thermocouple</b> leads {{will be brought to}} a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second <b>thermocouple</b> of each circuit.

25|$|The Nicrosil and Nisil <b>thermocouple</b> alloys show greatly {{enhanced}} thermoelectric stability {{relative to}} the other standard base-metal <b>thermocouple</b> alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own <b>thermocouple</b> temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a <b>thermocouple</b> located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a <b>thermocouple</b> attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
40|$|Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> are {{considered}} to be an alternative to High Temperature Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers (HTSPRTs) for realizing temperatures according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90) in the temperature range between aluminium (660. 323 °C) and silver (961. 78 °C). The original aim of this work was to develop and to validate a new reference function for Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> which reflects the properties of presently commercially available Au and Pt wires. The thermoelectric properties of 16 Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> constructed at different National Metrological Institutes by using wires from different suppliers and 4 commercially available Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> were investigated. Most of them exhibit significant deviations from the current reference function of Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> caused by the poor performance of the Au-wires available. Thermoelectric homogeneity was investigated by measuring immersion profiles during freezes at the freezing point of silver and in liquid baths. The thermoelectric inhomogeneities were found to be one order of magnitude larger than those of Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> of the Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 1749. The improvement of the annealing procedure of the gold wires is a key process to achieve thermoelectric homogeneities in the order of only about (2 – 3) mK, sufficient to replace the impracticable HTSPRTs as interpolation instruments of the ITS- 90. Comparison measurements of some of the Au/Pt <b>thermocouples</b> against a HTSPRT and an absolutely calibrated radiation thermometer were performed and exhibit agreements within the expanded measurement uncertainties.
