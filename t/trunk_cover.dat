25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable <b>trunk</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1978 the Volkswagen Beetle {{introduced}} {{air vents}} {{on the front}} <b>trunk</b> <b>cover</b> to bring fresh air to the interior.

With the cancellation of production in Germany, the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle started exporting to European markets, including West Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries. This exportation model was different from the Mexican market Beetle. [...] Its engine was a 1.2l 34 CV DIN. From the 1982 model on, the engine cover had no exterior vents. The different engine cover made it similar to German-produced VW 1200, as well as Mexican market Beetles sold before 1970. Also introduced were optional metallic paint colors: Silver Metallic, Copper Red Metallic, Cadmium Blue Metallic and Viper Green Metallic. [...] These colors were also available on the Caribe and the new European market Volkswagen Scirocco, as a reminder of the late 1970s models.|$|E

2500|$|Capitol {{initially}} ordered plant {{managers to}} destroy the covers, and the Jacksonville plant delivered most of its copies to a landfill. However, faced with so many jackets already printed, Capitol decided instead to paste a much more conventional cover over the old ones. The new cover, featuring {{a picture of the}} band posed around an open steamer trunk, had to be trimmed on the open end by about 3mm (1/8inch) because the new sheet, known as a [...] "slick", was not placed exactly [...] "square" [...] on top of the original cover. Tens of thousands of these so-called [...] "Trunk" [...] covers were sent out. As word of this manoeuvre became known to the public, owners of the altered cover attempted, usually unsuccessfully, to peel off the pasted-over cover, hoping to reveal the original image hidden beneath. Eventually, the soaring value and desirability of unpasted-over Butcher covers spurred the development of intricate and complex techniques for peeling the <b>Trunk</b> <b>cover</b> off {{in such a way that}} only faint horizontal glue lines remained on the original cover.|$|E
2500|$|Copies {{that have}} never had the white cover pasted onto them, known as [...] "first state" [...] covers, are very rare and command the highest prices. Copies with the pasted-on cover intact above the butcher image are known as [...] "second state" [...] or [...] "pasteovers". Today, pasteover covers that have {{remained}} unpeeled are also becoming increasingly rare and valuable; these can be identified if Ringo's black V-neck shirt from the original cover can be seen through the paste-over {{to the right of}} the trunk lid (in alignment with the word [...] "Today" [...] from the album title). Covers that have had the <b>Trunk</b> <b>cover</b> removed to reveal the underlying butcher image are known as [...] "third state" [...] covers; these are now the most common (and least valuable, although their value varies depending on how well the cover is removed) as people continue to peel second state covers. The most valuable and highly prized first and second state Butcher Covers are those that were never opened and remain still sealed in their original shrink wrap. Since the first documented collector's sale of a mono Butcher cover LP in 1974, which fetched US$457.00, the value of first state mono versions has consistently appreciated, reaching $20,000 in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, <b>trunk</b> <b>cover,</b> remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and fan shroud). An universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list.|$|E

On 4 May 1985 Stadt Zürich rammed a wall due to a technical defect at the footbridge in Zürich: Nobody is injured but the steamer suffered a hole in the bow and was repaired in ZSG's shipyard in Wollishofen.
