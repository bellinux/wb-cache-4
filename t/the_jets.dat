5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> had signed Namath days before the game.

This gave <b>the</b> <b>Jets</b> a 9–7 record, their second post-merger division title, and a playoff berth. Chad Pennington had an outstanding day against the Packers and finished the season the top-rated passer in the league. <b>The</b> <b>Jets</b> began the playoffs against the Indianapolis Colts at home, and defeated them 41–0. <b>The</b> <b>Jets</b> then played the Raiders, who again defeated them in Oakland, 30–10. <b>The</b> <b>Jets</b> lost a number of key players to free agency in the offseason. Four signed with the Washington Redskins, including kicker Hall, wide receiver Laveranues Coles, kick returner Chad Morton, and offensive lineman Randy Thomas. During a preseason game against the Giants, Pennington sustained a serious wrist injury, and required surgery.

5000|$|A jet of air will entrain {{molecules}} of air from its immediate surroundings, causing a [...] "tube," [...] or [...] "sleeve," [...] of low pressure around <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> (see image 1 in the diagram on the left). Ambient air from around this tube of low pressure will exert a force on <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> which, when seen in cross section, is equal in all directions. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> will therefore not deviate from {{moving in a}} straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel, to <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> (see image 2 in the diagram on the left), the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> causes a reduction in air pressure {{on that side of}} <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> that cannot be neutralized as rapidly as the low pressure region on the [...] "open" [...] side of <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> <b>The</b> pressure difference across <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> causes <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it (image 3 on <b>the</b> left). <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> will then adhere to the surface even if it is curved (image 4 on the left), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface will bring about the effects described for the initial bending of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> towards <b>the</b> surface.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the dynamical coupling of the ocean's {{surface and the}} ocean's interior. In particular, we investigate the dynamics of an oceanic surface jet, and its interaction with vortices at depth. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> is induced by buoyancy (density) anomalies at the surface. We first focus on <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> alone. <b>The</b> linear stability indicates there are two modes of instability: the sinuous and the varicose modes. When a vortex in present below <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> it interacts with it. The velocity field induced by the vortex perturbs <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> and triggers its destabilisation. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> also influences <b>the</b> vortex by pushing it under a region of co-operative shear. Strong jets may also partially shear out the vortex. We also investigate the interaction between a surface jet and a vortex dipole in the interior. Again, strong jets may partially shear out the vortex structure. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> also modifies <b>the</b> trajectory of the dipole. Dipoles travelling towards <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> at shallow incidence angles may be reflected by <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> Vortices travelling at moderate incidence angles normally cross below <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> This {{is related to the}} displacement of the two vortices of the dipole by the shear induced by <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b> Intense jets may also destabilise early and form streets of billows. These billows can pair with the vortices and separate the dipole. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} of high-pressure supersonic <b>jets</b> into <b>the</b> tokamak plasma is {{considered as a}} promising way of future thermonuclear reactor fueling and {{as a tool for}} disruption mitigation. Successful experiments were performed on Tore Supra and DIII-D, correspondingly. In the present paper the evolution of such a <b>jet</b> is analyzed. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> expansion, deceleration of the ambient electrons and ions by <b>the</b> <b>jet,</b> self-consistent electric field, elementary processes, radiation and adiabatic cooling of the ambient plasma are taken into account. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> is simulated by a MHD code, which is similar to the code previously used for pellets. It is demonstrated that the ionization degree of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> strongly depends on <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> parameters. Several simulations were performed for the range of parameters typical for DIII-D. <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> of initial density remains almost neutral, and only the outer regions are ionized. When <b>the</b> initial <b>jet</b> density is reduced by a factor of 2 or more the main part of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> becomes ionized rather fast. It is demonstrated that ionization at <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> edge in poloidal (perpendicular to the magnetic field) direction of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> is sufficient to stop poloidal expansion of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> by- 324 m 104 ⋅ Bj rr × force. The final poloidal size of <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> remains of <b>the</b> order of its initial poloidal dimension (of the order of ten centimetres). <b>The</b> <b>jet</b> motion in <b>the</b> radial direction (direction of the injection) is provided by the polarization poloidal electric field and the correspoding BE rr × drift. In the paper two mechanisms of polarization reduction are considered: Alfvén conductivity of the ambient plasma and the B ∇-induced drift. It is shown that almost neutral jet can penetrate deep into the tokamak while a modest ionization degree should prevent its penetration for the case of low field side (LFS) injection. 1...|$|R
