5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Emily Spivey and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. Parker Posey guest starred as Leslie's rival and former best friend, Lindsay Carlisle Shay. A longtime fan of Parks and Recreation and its star Amy Poehler, Posey had expressed an early interest in appearing on the show, and reportedly became frustrated with {{how long it took}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E
5|$|This is a {{city that}} doesn't have enough money for basic {{services}} right now and doesn't {{have enough money to}} protect regular citizens. The question has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> whether a full-time bodyguard detail to one alderman who hasn't been shown to be in any kind of danger {{for more than two decades}} is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Further {{appointments}} followed. Stainer {{became an}} honorary {{fellow of the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very soon}} after poor Harry Wyndham's death, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{receiving}} company," [...] said Lady Selina, solemnly. [...] "Really, mamma, I don't {{think it will}} be treating Fanny well <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> all these people so soon. The O'Joscelyns, or the Fitzgeralds, are all very well--just our own near neighbours; but don't you think, mamma, it's rather too soon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> a house-full of strange people?" ...|$|R
60|$|And Mme. la Duchesse, folding her mittened {{hands before}} her, seemed mutely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> the same question.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Thady is so queer in his manners; and I know Myles wouldn't like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> {{leave and}} {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> courting me." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> for a trial.|$|E
60|$|Rodney had {{completely}} dropped his pose {{as a man}} of the world, and seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> Henry <b>to</b> help him in a difficulty.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the red-haired}} {{man who had}} <b>been</b> first <b>to</b> {{discover}} him. A voice seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{who is he}} like?' Logan {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> Scremerston at that moment. 'I {{know the}} face--I know the voice; hang it!--where have I seen the man?' ...|$|R
25|$|One day I {{dreamed that}} I {{was not going}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> about a Soda reunion!.|$|E
25|$|Pagtatanung-tanong: In this method, the {{researcher}} undergoes {{a kind of}} questioning session with his kalahok or participants. In this method, however, 'lead questions' (those questions which directly refer to the topic being studied) are not supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked,</b> instead the questions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> {{are supposed to have}} been derived from the kalahoks answers themselves. The word tanong literally means 'question'.|$|E
25|$|Prodi had at {{the time}} been in office for 20 months, after winning the April 2006 general election. In February 2007, the Prime Minister handed in his resignation, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to remain by the President, and winning a vote of {{confidence}} in the Parliament.|$|E
50|$|I don't think it's {{right of}} us that <b>are</b> privileged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on City Council <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> others <b>to</b> look at {{assessments}} of particular people. I think that's very wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "Reasonable," [...] she interrupted. [...] "That is what I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>be!</b> <b>Ask</b> {{yourself}} a plain question. Which {{is the more}} fitting place for her--my house, or your chambers?" ...|$|R
50|$|They kidnap Ransom {{with a view}} {{to giving}} him to a Martian ruler who they believe (wrongly) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> for a human sacrifice. They travel to Mars but Ransom escapes.|$|R
25|$|Hayworth {{resented the}} fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to {{encourage}} her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to sing by troops at USO shows.|$|E
25|$|In Congress, {{there are}} tough {{questions}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> {{of the federal}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Is enforcement of coal mining regulations tough enough? Are the regulations on the books today current enough to handle the challenges posed by 21st century coal mining? Are mine hazards being minimized? These and other issues demand scrutiny, and the minersâ€™ families deserve the answers.|$|E
25|$|Every sitting day {{a period}} of time is set aside for {{questions}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> of ministers and select committee chairs. Questions to a minister must related to their official ministerial activities, not to his or her activities as a party leader or as a private Member of Parliament. In addition to questions asked orally during Question Time, Members of Parliament may also make inquiries in writing.|$|E
6000|$|The General nodded. [...] "Well, yes," [...] he said politely, [...] "that's {{exactly what}} he is; though, as you seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> about presumed relations, I didn't like to mention it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had thought," [...] {{said her}} ladyship at last, [...] "that you promised {{to tell us}} {{something}} {{that it was in}} our interest to hear. Instead, you appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> questions." ...|$|R
60|$|Jorgenson seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> those {{questions}} of himself. Mrs. Travers observed the empty stare, the self-communing voice, his unearthly lack of animation. Somehow {{it made it}} very easy to speak the whole truth to him.|$|R
25|$|In April 2008, Begg {{and seven}} other former Guantanamo detainees filed {{lawsuits}} in Britain's High Court accusing the British Attorney General, Home and Foreign Secretaries, MI5 and MI6, of unlawful acts, negligence and complicity in their abduction, treatment and interrogation. At a 2009 court hearing, Government lawyers denied the charges, but stated that MI5 had interviewed some detainees {{and in some}} instances supplied questions that they wished prisoners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benson {{also made}} {{history in the}} 1st Test in Sri Lanka, being the first umpire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to refer a {{decision}}. When Tillakaratne Dilshan asked for the umpire Mark Benson's decision to give him out caught behind to be reviewed, the English official changed his verdict when the television replay umpire Rudi Koertzen could not say conclusively that the ball had hit his bat or the ground on the way through to the Indian wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|After {{a school}} teacher {{suggested}} to her parents that her natural talent for singing and dancing should be nurtured, she was educated at the Aida Foster stage school {{from the age of}} 12, where she eventually became Head Girl. Her mother had to take an additional job to order to pay for the school fees. While training, she appeared in BBC Schools programmes. Webb later commented that, having come from a normal school, she found it a shock <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to perform in front of her classmates.|$|E
5000|$|If a Scout brings {{specific}} questions to his Scoutmaster, the Scoutmaster should answer within his comfort level, remembering that a [...] "boy who appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> about sexual intercourse... may really only {{be worried about}} pimples".|$|R
6000|$|... "Say it again!" [...] {{he seemed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> of me. [...] "Oh! {{say it all}} over again, the dear old English oaths and curses that in this God- forsaken land I never hoped to hear again." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> a {{tremendous}} lot {{of one man}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> player, captain and assistant manager. That looks <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an outsized man's job. He will need all the good wishes possible, and he has mine." ...|$|R
25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to {{the feel of a}} saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything it is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for the question <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as supplementary questions. These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|E
25|$|Wise was, however, {{taken seriously}} enough by the Topographical Engineers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> {{to build a}} balloon. Mary Hoehling {{indicated}} that Captain Whipple of the Topographical Engineers told Lowe that Wise was preparing to bring up his own balloon, supposedly the Atlantic. Other accounts state that John LaMountain had taken possession of the Atlantic after a failed flight he made with Wise in 1859, and later place the Atlantic with LaMountain at Fort Monroe. Lowe's report says that Captain Whipple indicated they had instructed Mr. Wise to construct a new balloon. He also proposed that Lowe pilot the new balloon. Prof. Lowe was vehemently opposed to flying one of Wise's old-style balloons.|$|E
5000|$|June 9 [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{seeing if}} I can {{challenge}} {{this at the}} Supreme Court level. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> the internet providers {{and all of the}} phone companies: ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit." ...|$|R
60|$|She said nothing. Only {{her eyebrows}} were very {{slightly}} raised. She seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> him silently what possible concern {{the age of}} the lady of Thorpe-Hatton could <b>be</b> <b>to</b> him. He <b>was</b> <b>to</b> understand that his remark was almost an impertinence.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{should ever}} <b>be</b> obliged <b>to</b> live like the Buskirks on the hill," [...] the good lady {{would say to}} herself, [...] "I would wish myself back to what I used <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>asking</b> only that my debts be paid." ...|$|R
