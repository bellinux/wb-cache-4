25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I <b>think</b> <b>no</b> State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E

According to Kyle Ellison from Drowned in Sound, Nas also commented on gender expectations in his rap, citing the line [...] "when he date, he straight, chip off his old papa / when she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed off / 'cause we <b>think</b> <b>no</b> one is good enough for our daughters." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 16, 1874, {{while in}} Boston, Edward Dickinson {{suffered}} a stroke and died. When the simple funeral {{was held in the}} Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28. She wrote to Higginson that her father's [...] "Heart was pure and terrible and I <b>think</b> <b>no</b> other like it exists." [...] A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also {{suffered a stroke}}, which produced a partial lateral paralysis and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that [...] "Home is so far from Home".|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and <b>think</b> <b>no</b> further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Felt {{was offered}} the command of all U.S. forces in the Pacific and Far East, and he jumped at the {{opportunity}} to avoid spending {{the rest of his}} career behind a desk. Upon becoming commander in chief of Pacific Command on July 31, 1958, Felt immersed himself in the details of its operation, bombarding his staff with scribbled black pencil missives dubbed [...] "Feltgrams" [...] that invariably concluded, [...] "Advise me [...] What do you <b>think?</b> <b>No?</b> Why? Resp'y, F." [...] Although his job title was officially abbreviated as [...] "CINCPAC", he was informally nicknamed [...] "CINCFELT" [...] within the command, due to his larger-than-life personality. During his tenure as CINCPAC, Felt directed American military operations in three regional hotspots: Taiwan, Laos, and Vietnam.|$|E

2500|$|The Russell Tribunal, {{also known}} as the International War Crimes Tribunal, Russell-Sartre Tribunal, or Stockholm Tribunal, was a private body {{organised}} by British philosopher and Nobel Prize winner Bertrand Russell and hosted by French philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre. Along with Lelio Basso, Ken Coates, Ralph Schoenman, Julio Cortázar and several others, the tribunal investigated and evaluated American foreign policy and military intervention in Vietnam, following the 1954 defeat of French forces at Diên Biên Phu and the establishment of North and South Vietnam. The tribunal did not investigate alleged war crimes by the Viet Cong; Schoenman commented: [...] "Lord Russell would <b>think</b> <b>no</b> more of doing that than of trying the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto for their uprising against the Nazis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inquiring {{after the}} reliques of former manners, I {{found that in}} Ulva, and, I <b>think,</b> <b>no</b> where else, is {{continued}} the payment of the Mercheta Mulierum; a fine in old times due to the Laird at the marriage of a virgin. The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough English, is variously delivered. It is pleasant to find ancient customs in old families. This payment, like others, was, for want of money, made anciently in the produce of the land. Macquarry was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe. A sheep has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will bring at one time more, at another less. (Johnson) ...|$|E

In a later interview with MTV News Drake said that he felt the song should have been performed by a woman, stating, [...] "Find Your Love is an extremely vulnerable song. And it's actually a huge risk. It almost feels like the song should be performed by a woman. I'm just hoping that men really hear the song and they're honest with themselves. I know a lot of men feel that way." [...] The song was posted on Drake's official blog on April 29, 2010, but was later removed due to bandwidth issues.|$|E

2500|$|Fremantle went on {{to write}} in his book [...] "Three Months in the Southern States" [...] that he had [...] "not {{attempted}} to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove {{of some of their}} customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I <b>think</b> <b>no</b> generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed {{in the history of the}} world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, [...] "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I <b>think</b> <b>no</b> person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....by far {{the most}} Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being).... For the sudden introduction of such change there is I <b>think</b> <b>no</b> precedent {{in the history of this}} country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E
