It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up <b>the</b> <b>distortions.</b> Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing <b>the</b> <b>distortions.</b> The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E

5|$|As he is {{affected}} less by <b>the</b> <b>distortions,</b> Data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds {{a column of}} energy emanating from a dimensional matrix, {{the source of the}} time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a Paris café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E

5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with <b>the</b> <b>distortions,</b> Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Returns is set {{after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. In XIII, Lightning is one of six people who are turned by a fal'Cie—one of a race created by the gods—into l'Cie, {{servants}} of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit; those that succeed in their Focus go into crystal stasis, while those that fail turn into monsters called Cie'th. The six were intended to cause the large, floating sphere named Cocoon to fall onto the world of Gran Pulse below, killing all the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe. The remaining l'Cie were made human again by the Goddess Etro, the deity responsible for maintaining the balance between the mortal world and the Unseen Realm. In XIII-2, it is revealed that Etro's interference allowed Chaos, an energy trapped in the Unseen Realm, to escape and distort the timeline as written {{after the fall of}} Cocoon. Lightning was drawn to Valhalla, Etro's citadel, and decided to stay and act as her protector. Three years after Cocoon's fall, Lightning's sister Serah sets out to correct <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> and reunite with Lightning, while the people of Gran Pulse construct a new Cocoon, since the old one is destined to collapse. The protagonists unwittingly end up instigating the death of Etro, which allows Chaos to spill into the mortal world and bring an end to time itself. Serah also dies, causing Lightning to nearly lose hope. Reassured by her sister's spirit, Lightning chooses to enter crystal stasis to preserve her sister's memory and keep hope alive.|$|E

40|$|Stereographic Draping is a {{mathematical}} model of garment draping that unfolds a 3 -D garment surface to the corresponding flat garment patterns. This unfolding process is accurate only when the fabric is rigid.

50|$|Furthermore, Houk’s {{examination}} of distortion energies finds {{that nearly all}} of <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> energy (92%) arises from <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> of <b>the</b> 1,3 dipole rather than the cyclooctyne, which has a pre-distorted ground state geometry which increases its reactivity.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>distortion</b> from massive MIMO (multiple-input [...] multiple-output) base {{stations}} with nonlinear amplifiers is studied and its radiation pattern is derived. <b>The</b> <b>distortion</b> is analyzed both in-band and out-of-band. By using an orthogonal Hermite {{representation of the}} amplified signal, the spatial cross-correlation matrix of <b>the</b> nonlinear <b>distortion</b> is obtained. It shows that, if the input signal to the amplifiers has a dominant beam, <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> is beamformed {{in the same way}} as that beam. When there are multiple beams without any one being dominant, it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> is practically isotropic. The derived theory is useful to predict how <b>the</b> nonlinear <b>distortion</b> will behave, to analyze the out-of-band radiation, to do reciprocity calibration, and to schedule users in the frequency plane to minimize the effect of in-band distortion...|$|R

25|$|In other {{configurations}} involving π or δ bonding, {{like for}} example when the degenerate state is associated to the t2g orbitals of an octahedral configuration, the distortion and stabilisation energies are usually much smaller {{and the possibility}} of not observing the distortion due to dynamic JT effects is much higher.

The thesis {{is divided into two}} areas of interest relating to the design of broadband fiber optic links. The first area is the application of numerical methods and commensurate line methods to the design of compact equalisers which allow an improved transducer power gain over a wide band.
