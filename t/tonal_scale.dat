40|$|It {{is argued}} that the current modular {{conception}} {{of the human mind}} has important implications for the status of music processing in the architecture of the cognitive system. This conceptualization led us to treat several issues that have been neglected in the cognitive study of music. The major issue concerns the importance of specifying both models and experimental tasks in terms of stages in information processing. This approach is advocated as a preliminary step for identifying separable components in the processing of music and for assessing whether these comonents possess modular properties. In this perspective, and {{on the grounds of the}} available empirical facts, encoding of pitch information in terms of <b>tonal</b> <b>scales</b> is suggested to be a serious candidate for modularity. These computations appear to be made in an automatic way and seem to be acquired precociously and without explicit tutoring.

All sequences between same-function chords, from the weaker member to the stronger (e.g. VII - V), are forbidden. When using the natural minor, dominant chords exchange their leading tone for a subtonic; as a result, their dominant quality is strongly undermined.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this time that Riley began to paint {{the black and white}} works for which she is best known. They present a great variety of {{geometric}} forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and sky diving. From 1961 to 1964 she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing <b>tonal</b> <b>scales</b> of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in Fall, a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies. Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the Happenings, for which the period is famous), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led Aldous Huxley to experiment with hallucinogenic drugs; concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a nuclear war; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World. Her paintings have, since 1961, been executed by assistants from her own endlessly edited studies.|$|R

This, she said, triggered her curiosity. Working step by step, she made the assumption it was significant that the sublinear signs were never absent from the text, while entire verses are totally lacking supralinear signs. In her opinion it had to mean that the sublinear signs had to be [...] "more important" [...] than the supralinear ones. This conclusion {{formed the basis of}} her conjectures. She focused on the prose te'amim system only. That system comprises 8 sublinear signs. She made the hypothesis that it corresponded to the eight degrees of a musical scale, particularly of a <b>tonal</b> <b>scale,</b> (the diatonic scale - C, D, E, etc. - being the oldest). In her mind that was supported by the nearly systematic writing of a vertical sign {{at the end of each}} verse. This sign, she assumed, could work like an end note, and could be used to indicate the main note (tonic) of a scale. As she worked with each verse she became convinced that the notes of her transcription formed coherent melodies and not random sounds. By comparing individual verses she then compiled tables of concordant sequences. Analyzing the shapes of signs, she finally assigned conjectural values to the 8 sublinear signs of the prose system, suggesting that they are the 8 notes of a scale. But musicologists view the hypothesis that the signs represent the degrees of a scale as unlikely and a method which assigns the values of the signs arbitrarily based only on a subjective assessment of the quality of the melodies that assignment produces as flawed.|$|E

The results showed that communicative vocalizations were shorter and had a wider pitch range than investigative vocalizations and that these patterns in communicative vocalizations depended on {{the intention of the}} vocalizations: requests and expressions of discontent displayed wider pitch range and longer duration than responses or statements.

As the last track {{on the last}} King Crimson album of the 1970s, it {{features}} several moments which recall earlier releases. It starts with mellotron strings, electric guitar and a saxophone, playing in a style recalling [...] "Epitaph" [...] from In the Court of the Crimson King. These introduce a vocal segment in conventional verse-chorus structure. The middle section of the song is a build-up of dynamics and tone in 13/4 which recalls [...] "The Talking Drum" [...] from Larks' Tongues in Aspic. Starting with John Wetton's bass, then shortly after joined by Bill Bruford on woodblocks and cymbals which gradually progress and increase until the entire drum kit is utilized, and Robert Fripp's guitar repeating a two note theme in a repetitive rhythm, the playing of each member gradually becomes louder, more distorted and much wilder in each verse, though the tempo stays constant. All the while Fripp's guitar plays only two different notes in each verse, gradually ascending the musical scale of the piece while increasing the loudness and distortion {{in line with the}} increasingly louder playing of the bass, and the more frenetic playing of the drums. The unusual 13/4 time signature allows for a lot of creative rhythmic playing by Bruford, which rhythms mirror the increasing tensions building in both the ascension of Fripp's <b>tonal</b> <b>scale</b> and the gradually more distorted and menacing bass and guitar playing. The song's final section begins with an abrupt transition to a fast, jazzy saxophone solo with distorted guitars and bass, expressive tribal drumming by Bruford, and the tempo doubling up to a time signature of 13/8. The solo ends and the song drives now at its peak in 13/8 time, with Wetton's original bass line repeated at the double time speed at full volume and distortion, Fripp also at full volume distortion at the highest note of the musical scale of the piece and Bruford pounding the drums at full intensity. With all of the players hitting full out power at top speed, the song reaches its climax. This recalls the wilder section of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man", the band's signature piece from that era (and also from In the Court of the Crimson King).

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of child language research is to identify the relevant factors that {{play a role in}} the acquisition course of a particular linguistic feature. This article analyzes the role of stress, word position, and word length in the acquisition of coda consonants by Catalan and Spanish children. The fact that the two languages differ substantially in their coda distribution (e. g., stressed word-final codas are more frequent in Catalan than in Spanish) will allow us to test the potential effects of coda distribution in the target language on early coda production. Sixteen Catalan-dominant and Spanish-dominant two-year-olds from the Barcelona area participated in two elicitation tasks with both novel and familiar words of different phonological shapes. Coda productions were assessed in stressed vs. unstressed syllables, in word-medial vs. word-final syllables, and in monosyllables vs. polysyllables. Results showed that the distributional difference between coda consonants in the two languages has crucial effects on the children’s coda production. That is, Catalan-dominant children produce significantly more stressed word-final codas than Spanish-dominant children. This result lends support to the idea that when prominence is held equal, as in a controlled experiment, there are still crosslinguistic differences in coda production that are consistent with the frequency distribution of coda consonants in the respective languages, which means that children are very closely attuned to the frequency patterns of prosodic structure in the input language and are aware of their specific distributions across the lexicon.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{work on the}} {{temporal}} coordination between gesture and speech found that the prominence in gesture coordinates with speech prominence. This study investigates the anchoring regions in speech and pointing gesture aligning with each other. Our hypotheses are that (a) in contrastive focus conditions the gesture apex is anchored in the intonation peak, (b) the upcoming prosodic boundary influences the timing of gesture and intonation movements. Method: 15 Catalan speakers pointed at a screen while pronouncing a target word with different metrical patterns in a contrastive focus condition and followed by a phrase boundary. A total of 702 co-speech deictic gestures were acoustically and gesturally analyzed. Results: Intonation peaks and gesture apexes showed parallel behavior {{with respect to their}} position within the accented syllable: they occurred {{at the end of the}} accented syllable in non-phrase-final position, whereas they occurred well before the end of the accented syllable in phrase-final position. Crucially, the position of intonation peaks and gesture apexes was correlated and was bound by prosodic structure. Conclusions: The results refine the phonological synchronization rule (McNeill, 1992), showing that gesture apexes are anchored in intonation peaks, and that gesture and prosodic movements are bound by prosodic phrasing.
