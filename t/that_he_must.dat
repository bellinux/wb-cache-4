5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> wait.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E

5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency.

5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back.

From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E

5|$|Lucilla's guardian, Oliver Carleton, visits Bath to {{investigate}} her new living arrangements. Carleton is a rake– a sexually experienced man {{who refuses to}} conform to many of society's guidelines.

5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have been prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career.
