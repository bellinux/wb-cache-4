Major Grodin Tierce, the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn's tactical intellect by the Grand Admiral himself, strategized that the false Thrawn {{could also be used}} to rally support for the Empire and intimidate the New Republic. The tactic is successful until Admiral Pellaeon and <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> Talon Karrde—on opposing sides but desiring peace—expose Flim.

On one occasion {{in the autumn}} of 1924 the customs patrol boat Bjørnen discovered <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> ship Paul Weber off Halten in Sør-Trøndelag. Paul Weber was operated by a group of smugglers led by the flamboyant Paul Weber.

Kumbudren Samy brings Thenmozhi to the Zamindar's house to introduce them to each other. Thenmozhi is identified to be the Zamindar's enemy's daughter, which Kumbudren Samy was unaware of. When the Zamindar tells him to break up with her, Saamy refuses and attacks him verbally, telling that he doesn't have a family and no one loves him so he would never understand. An angered Zaminder throws out Kumbudren Samy and Walter as well who tried to defend his brother and gets extremely drunk. Later that evening, both brothers make up with the Zamindar and invite him to their home. The Zamindar even signs over his land to Thenmozhi's father {{who was trying to}} get a hold of the land and organises for their marriage. Few days later, <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> returns, kidnaps the Zamindar and flogs him into unconsciousness, before hanging him to death from a tree. Walter and Kumbudren Samy are devastated and almost collapse with grief. While Kumbudren Samy fails in his attempt to take revenge, getting flogged and injured severely, Walter manages to bash up <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> and his men. <b>The</b> <b>smuggler</b> has been tied down under the platform with the Zamindar's body and is burnt to death along with the Zamindar, while both brothers dance madly.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after the end of the Vietnam War, the Hercules {{continued}} to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments. They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters, including tsunami in New Guinea, cyclones in the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and fires and floods in Australia. The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following Cyclone Tracy in 1974–75; a No.37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster. Eight of No.36 Squadron's aircraft were involved in the relief effort, flying over 550hours, and carrying 2,864passengers and almost 800,000lbs of cargo, while No.37 Squadron contributed 11aircraft, flying 700hours, and carrying 4,400 passengers and 1,300,000lbs of cargo. [...] On 19January 1978 a C-130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug-smuggling aircraft near Darwin; <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> eventually landed at Katherine, and was arrested. After clocking up 147,000accident-free flying hours over the course of 20years, No.36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced in 1978 by C-130H models. The C-130Hs were primarily used as tactical air lifters throughout their service with the RAAF, and worked closely with the Army's special forces units.|$|E
500|$|Tarbosaurus fossils {{are only}} found around the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China, {{both of which}} ban their export, though some {{specimens}} have been looted by private collectors. A recent $1 million smuggling deal was uncovered when suspicions were raised about a catalog put out by Heritage Auctions for an event in New York City on May 20, 2012. By Mongolian law, any specimen found in the Gobi Desert was to rest at an appropriate Mongolian institution and there was little reasonable doubt that the Tarbosaurus bataar advertised on the catalog was a stolen one. The president of Mongolia and many paleontologists raised objections to the sale {{which led to a}} last-minute investigation that confirmed that it was a specimen that can only be found in the Gobi Desert, rightfully belonging to Mongolia. During the court case (United States v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skeleton), Eric Prokopi, <b>the</b> <b>smuggler,</b> pleaded guilty to illegal smuggling and the dinosaur was returned to Mongolia in 2013, where it is temporarily displayed on Sukhbaatar Square, {{the center of the city}} of Ulaanbaatar. Prokopi had sold the dinosaur with a partner and fellow commercial hunter in England, Christopher Moore. [...] The case led to the repatriation of dozens more Mongolian dinosaurs, including several skeletons of Tarbosaurus bataar.|$|E

Lafitte worked with several smugglers, including Jim Bowie, to profit from the poorly written law. Lafitte's men identified slave ships and captured them. Smugglers would purchase the slaves for a discounted price, march them to Louisiana, and turn them in to customs officials. [...] A representative of <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> would purchase the slaves at the ensuing auction, and <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> would be given half of the purchase price. <b>The</b> <b>smuggler</b> became the lawful owner of the slaves and could resell them in New Orleans, or transport them for sale {{in other parts of the}} Deep South, which was the major market of the time.|$|E

He published poetry collections including Canciones (Songs) and Romancero Gitano (Gypsy Ballads, 1928), which became his best known book of poetry. It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. García Lorca describes the work as a [...] "carved altar piece" [...] of Andalusia with [...] "gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> and the celestial note of the naked children of Córdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles". In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and he only gained notability as a playwright much later.
