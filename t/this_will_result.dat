5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the residual gas load from the previous dive. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown that}} the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical time scale for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 1010 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E

5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to a hive mind. The Overmind becomes aware of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create a weapon to free the Zerg from the control of his Dark Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E

25|$|The diver {{must carry}} {{sufficient}} weight to remain neutral at the shallowest decompression stop {{after all the}} gas has been used. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in the diver being somewhat negative {{at the start of}} the dive, and the buoyancy compensator must have sufficient volume to neutralise this excess.

25|$|Very loose {{surfaces}} (such as {{gravel and}} loose dirt): In some loose-surface situations, {{it may be}} beneficial to completely lock up the rear wheel in order to slow down or maintain control. On very steep slopes with loose surfaces where any braking will cause the wheel to skid, it can be better to maintain control of the bicycle by the rear-brake more than one would normally. However neither wheel should stop rotating completely, as <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in very little control.|$|E

Larger defects may require repair with a skin graft, local skin flap, pedicled skin flap, or a microvascular free flap.

25|$|These {{artifacts}} can {{be reduced}} by choosing {{a lower level of}} compression; they may be completely avoided by saving an image using a lossless file format, though <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in a larger file size. The images created with ray-tracing programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain. Certain low-intensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images, but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed, usually resulting in unacceptable quality. Consider the example below, demonstrating the effect of lossy compression on an edge detection processing step.|$|E
25|$|Term I {{accounts}} for past {{values of the}} SP-PV error and integrates them over time to produce the I term. For example, {{if there is a}} residual SP-PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>result</b> in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.|$|E
25|$|Micro {{wind turbine}} {{are used to}} harvest wind energy readily {{available}} in the environment {{in the form of}} kinetic energy to power the low power electronic devices such as wireless sensor nodes.

Similar to photovoltaics, wind farms have been constructed on an industrial scale and are being used to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy.|$|E
