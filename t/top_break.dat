25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} swing out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in <b>top</b> <b>break</b> models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
500|$|The British company Webley & Scott (P. Webley & Son before {{merger with}} W & C Scott in 1897) {{produced}} {{a range of}} revolvers from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries. [...] As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers. [...] Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son, manufacturing included their own [...]44-caliber rim-fire solid frame revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith & Wesson's Tip up break action revolvers. [...] The quintessential hinged frame, centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models. [...] The W.G. or Webley-Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s, (often incorrectly {{referred to as the}} Webley-Green) are the most popular of the commercial <b>top</b> <b>break</b> revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of English military officers and target shooters in the period, coming in a [...]476/.455 calibre. [...] However other short-barrel solid-frame revolvers, including the Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) model and the British Bulldog revolver, designed to be carried in a coat pocket for self-defence were far more commonplace during the period. [...] Today, undoubtedly best-known are the range of military revolvers, which were in service use across two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts.|$|E

[...] While this design is mostly obsolete today, supplanted by the stronger yet equally convenient swing-out design, manufacturers have begun making reproductions of late 19th century designs for use in cowboy action shooting.|$|E

60|$|I {{once did}} manage to make a cast correctly: the fly went over the fish's nose; he rose; I hooked him, {{and he was a}} great silly brute of a {{grayling}}. The grayling is the deadest-hearted and the foolishest-headed fish that swims. I would as lief catch a perch or an eel as a grayling. This is the worst of it--this ambition of the duffer's, this desire for perfection, as if the golfing imbecile should match himself against Mr. Horace Hutchinson, or as the sow of the Greek proverb challenged Athene to sing. I know it all, I deplore it, I regret the evils of ambition; but c'est plus fort que moi. If there is a trout rising well under the pendant boughs that trail in the water, if there is a brake of briars behind me, a strong wind down stream, for that trout, in that impregnable situation, I am impelled to fish. If I raise him I strike, miss him, catch up in his tree, swish the cast off into the briars, break my <b>top,</b> <b>break</b> my heart, but--that is the humour of it. The passion, or instinct, being in all senses blind, must no doubt be hereditary. It is full of sorrow and bitterness and hope deferred, and entails the mockery of friends, especially of the fair. But I would as soon lay down a love of books as a love of fishing.|$|E

50|$|Under trade wind conditions, {{there is}} very often a {{pronounced}} moisture discontinuity between 4000 and 8000 ft. Below these heights, the air is moist; above, it is dry. The break (a large-scale feature of the Pacific High) {{is caused by a}} temperature inversion embedded in the moving trade wind air. The inversion tends to suppress the vertical movement of air and so restricts cloud development to the zone just below the inversion. The inversion is present 50 to 70 percent of the time; its height fluctuates from day to day, but it is usually between 5000 and 7000 ft. On trade wind days when the inversion is well defined, the clouds develop below these heights with only an occasional cloud <b>top</b> <b>breaking</b> through the inversion.|$|R
