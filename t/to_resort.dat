5|$|At the time, when {{almost all}} parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory {{position}} toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS {{was the only}} political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to violence {{in order to achieve}} that goal.|$|E
5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none.

On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river.

Despite claiming to have <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to manual labour {{to pay for his}} food, Belcourt supported a household that included a school teacher, a housekeeper, a Chippewa cook and several servants. Thirty miles to the west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} he could have ended Bodyline in two overs without needing <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to a leg field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E

5|$|The general {{first degree}} (for Magister) centred on the {{teaching}} of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place {{to the authority of}} Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music), their coverage was neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would have <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who had <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to peddling were to be exempted from taxation.|$|E

5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E

5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation.

Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer should not have <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to reading summaries on the packaging {{to make sense of}} a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
