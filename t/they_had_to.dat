5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, {{and if it was}} broken <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|Cherith Baldry, one of {{the people}} who write using the pen name Erin Hunter, said that it was hard to write the death of Feathertail at the end of Moonrise because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> present it in a way {{suitable}} for the book's younger target audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have their {{ordnance}} packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than inserted through the breech.|$|E

5|$|With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney {{then moved}} skirmishers and horse {{artillery}} up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with canister. The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> combine {{to form a}} viable square.|$|E
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised {{when he saw the}} additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|After the Munich Agreement, two tank battalions {{were sent}} to {{reinforce}} the 3rd Mobile Division in Slovakia. They were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength.

5|$|After {{traveling}} across Spain, {{the embassy}} sailed on the Mediterranean aboard three Spanish frigates towards Italy.

5|$|Although the s were a {{significant}} improvement from the preceding , especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by {{the advent of the}} dreadnought well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} imagine and invent {{relevant}} and effective strategies, which African and Asian nation-states and their institutions can use as instruments {{through which they}} can challenge the trends of megapoly of global capitalism, first of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> transform solidarity to an effective ideological foundation of their actions. The appropriate question is solidarity for what? The short answer is for building a peaceful and developmental region where poverty eradication is the main objective. Thus, this becomes an ideological construct. Second of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do the inventory of what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> as natural and social assets, and as skills. Third of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know one another through educational systems and other training programs. Fourth of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> set up their policy priorities based on their people’s living standards. Fifth of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> establish strong regional institutions through which decisions can be made collectively. And sixth of all, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deepen their own democracies. Furthermore, their concept of security <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be re-defined. It should go beyond militarism. It should include human security, which means the protection of social, political and economic rights, {{the protection of the}} eco-systems, and formulation and implementation of policies intended for the elimination of poverty.|$|R

5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{played their}} first two seasons at Salt Lake Stadium, but in the 2016 season, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move to Rabindra Sarobar Stadium due to the unavailabilty of Salt Lake Stadium, which was shortlisted {{as one of the}} venues for the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup.

5|$|Because all {{the members}} were working their band {{schedule}} round their jobs <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> practice in basic recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E

5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
