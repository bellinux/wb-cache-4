50|$|Major inflows of {{freshwater}} include the Rauma River and Eira River. Unlike many other fjords, Romsdalsfjord has several islands: Molde Archipelago, Otrøya, Midøya, Sekken and Veøya. Salinity is slightly lower at the surface, just below 3 %. Observations around 1930 showed salinity close to 3.5 % and stable temperatures just over 7°C {{in the deep}} parts. Heavy, oxygene-rich water from Atlantic typically flow over <b>treshold</b> in April-June and sink to deepest part where old water is displaced. Along the fjord there are examples of hanging valleys, for instance Sjølbotn at Innfjorden. Post-glacial rebound has lifted the land around Romsdalsfjord up to 100 m leaving previous subsea deposits of gravel and clay as wide terraces for instance in the valley mouths around Åndalsnes, Veblungsnes, Innfjorden and Isfjorden.|$|E

Methods: The change in pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile <b>treshold</b> was taken from the area above myofascial trigger point number one trapezius muscle - pars ascendens, and the vibration <b>treshold</b> at dorsum of metacarpal bone of the index finger. Fifty myofascial trigger points were examined (twenty-four from a group of probands with chronic cervicalgia or cervicobrachialgia syndrome, twenty-six in the control group). Results: The pressure pain threshold and vibrotactile threshold did not change after the PIR in the group of patients. But the threshold of vibration sense significantly decreased (nearly by 18 %, p = 0. 001). The result was opposite in the control group. Pressure pain threshold increased by 11 % (p < 0. 001) and vibrotactile threshold fell by almost 16 % (p = 0. 001). Vibration threshold did not change. Conclusions: The study confirmed that PIR can affect not only the pressure pain <b>treshold,</b> but also vibrotactile and even vibration <b>treshold.</b> PIR revealed an alteration to pain perception, vibrotactile and vibratin sensation in the group of patients.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use hedonic models to measure the {{influence}} of noise nuisance on rents, costs and values of investment properties in Switzerland. Countrywide data is provided by institutional real estate investors. The effects are measured for aircraft noise, road traffic noise and railroad noise. We show that negative effects appear between lower and upper <b>tresholds</b> which vary between different noise types and across residential and non-residential properties. Rents, costs and values are affected below the administrative <b>tresholds</b> given by the LSV and the negative impact ceases at an upper threshold. However high noise nuisance might influence investment decisions, i. e. offices are built instead of housing etc. These important effects are not given account in the data. In addition, directly measured reductions on market values are lower than the expected reductions based on empirical effects on rents and costs. The reasons for the different market value reductions {{may be found in}} the Swiss tenancy law. Rents for dwellings within existing rental agreements can only be adjusted in accordance with the change of the "reference interest rate" (Referenzzinssatz) and the CPI. The analysis shows that the average contract duration is dependent on the noise nuisance, which leads to a significant reduction of noise-induced losses within periods of increasing market rents...|$|R
