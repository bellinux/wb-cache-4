5|$|The {{most notable}} {{members of the}} group include Ernest Zobole, a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of the industrialised {{buildings}} of the valleys set against the green hills that surround them. Also from the Rhondda Fawr was sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period {{structures}} in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout {{consists of a}} westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was {{likely to have been}} the temple of Awilix, patron goddess of the Nija'ib' K'iche'. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This K'iche' layout was somewhat distorted by the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of Mam- and K'iche'-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages.|$|E

5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. <b>The</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of texts from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to {{the climax of the}} preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E

50|$|Ramon Castellano's {{painting}} is sustained on two fundamental props: composition and color, varying from pure academic realism, with marine and urban landscapes, to severe abstract expressionism with <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> {{of color and}} the studied composition developed in all his works.|$|R
50|$|In {{works like}} Wonder Woman II (2011), for example, Thukral & Tagra mix iconic Indian motifs—lotus flowers—with iconic images from Western pop culture—of Superman—to explore <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> of East and West, {{traditional}} and new, enduring and ephemeral in Indian culture and {{identity in the}} 21st century.|$|R

25|$|Neeson, who {{nearly always}} {{suppresses}} his Irish accent when acting, agreed {{to play the}} part of Clinch only {{on the condition that}} he could use his Irish accent. Neeson remarked on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he made this demand because an episode of MacFarlane's Family Guy had previously made a joke out of <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of Neeson playing a cowboy with an Irish accent.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothetical}} continuation {{and expansion}} of the Angevin Empire over several centuries {{has been the subject}} of several tales of alternate history. Historically, both English and French historians had viewed <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an aberration and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an encumbrance, while French historians considered the union to be an English empire.|$|E

50|$|The Secret World is {{a comedy}} radio series using impressionists {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4. Using {{many of the}} creative team from the long-running series Dead Ringers, and originating as part of Radio 4's Happy Mondays pilot strand in 2008, the Secret World takes a subtler, more naturalistic approach, using famous figures in various bizarre yet humdrum situations, the comedy arising from <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> of contrasting characters and situations.|$|R
5000|$|In {{using the}} Homeric Epics, the ancient writers were {{not trying to}} deceive their readers; in fact MacDonald {{believes}} the ancient readers understood <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> of Jesus with Odysseus. “Mark’s purpose”, he argues, “in creating so many stories about Jesus was to demonstrate how superior Jesus was to Greek heroes. Few readers of Mark fail {{to see how he}} portrays Jesus as superior to Jewish worthies… He does the same for Greek heroes.” ...|$|R

25|$|Church's {{landscape}} {{conformed to}} the aesthetic {{principles of the}} picturesque, as propounded by the British theorist William Gilpin, which began with a careful observation of nature that was then enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony. <b>The</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of smooth and irregular forms was an important principle, and is represented in The Heart of the Andes by the rounded hills and pool {{of water on the}} one hand, and by the contrasting jagged mountains and rough trees on the other.|$|E
25|$|Haiku are a short, 3-line verse form, {{which have}} {{achieved}} significant global popularity, and the haiku form has been adapted from Japanese into other languages. Typical of the haiku form is the metrical pattern of 3 lines with a distribution of 5, 7, and 5 on (also known as morae) within those lines. Other features include <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of two images or ideas with a kireji ("cutting word") between them, and a kigo, or seasonal reference, usually {{drawn from a}} saijiki, or traditional list of such words.|$|E

25|$|In response, Zemskov {{wrote that}} the charge that Zemskov {{allegedly}} did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers {{is that they do}} not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of new information with “old” one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E
25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. It showed {{a beautiful girl}} in riding habit reclining against the neck of a horse which is on its knees among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics; some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject. The picture gained the alternative title of 'The Pretty Horsebreaker'.|$|E
25|$|After Manet's {{death the}} two {{pictures}} hung {{on either side}} of the 1877 painting Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Role of Hamlet. From this arrangement Stoichiţă concludes that the choice of this Spanish influenced painting was meant to evoke a renewed parallel to Velázquez. Another message derived from <b>the</b> <b>juxtaposition</b> is that the self-portraits could almost be read as Manet in the Role of Manet. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, however, points out that Manet probably did not intend the pictures to be so displayed, as it was Léon Leenhoff who had the pictures framed and hung them {{on either side of}} the Faure portrait.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Noel Frackman said in Arts Magazine:No {{lines or}} forms are extraneous; the {{application}} of the paint itself, <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> of elements all work towards a tense, euclidean harmony. The varying thickness of drawn lines and an unusual sensitivity for the weight of various forms lift these paintings out of the realm of simple geometric constructions into the area of the theoretical. In a sense, these white paintings are philosophical musings on the nature of geometry as pure idea.|$|R
5000|$|Describing {{similar works}} by the artist, art {{historian}} John House wrote, “His cliff tops rarely show a single sweep of terrain. Instead there are breaks in space; the eye progresses into depth by a succession of jumps; distance is expressed by planes overlapping each other and by atmospheric rather than linear perspective- by softening the focus and changes of color.” The sense of immediacy is heightened by <b>the</b> <b>juxtapositions</b> of <b>the</b> cliff and sea, the contrast between ground and openness.|$|R
