5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the <b>transom,</b> the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a <b>transom</b> dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door <b>transom</b> and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular <b>transom</b> light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{couplers}} previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or <b>transoms</b> to standards, putlog {{or single}} couplers join board bearing <b>transoms</b> to ledgers - Non-board bearing <b>transoms</b> should be fixed using a right-angle coupler. Swivel couplers are to connect tubes {{at any other}} angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring {{at the same level}} in neighbouring standards.|$|R
50|$|The side facade facing St. Antoine {{also has}} five bays: a wide center bay with five pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms,</b> two {{flanking}} bays with {{three pairs of}} one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms,</b> and two end bays with two pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms.</b> Brick piers with limestone banding separate the windows. The elevations that do not face the street are red brick with limestone sills, pierced by similar one-over-one double-hung windows.|$|R
50|$|Commercial storefronts, {{separated}} by a glassed-in theatre entrance, face north and west on the main floor. Other exterior features include multi-paned <b>transoms,</b> fanlight <b>transoms,</b> red tile hoods above windows, decorative molding, mock rafters, and wrought-iron balconets. With a few exceptions, the exterior looks {{much as it did}} in 1927.|$|R
5|$|Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square <b>transom</b> removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved {{protection in the}} rear and allowed a better field of fire. She was subsequently laid up then repaired and cut down to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831. Recommissioned in August 1841 under Lord Clarence Paget, she {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the brick schoolhouse that faces west onto Constitution Square and stands between the Watts-Bell House and Grayson's Tavern. Local {{tradition}} holds that it dates to approximately {{the same time as}} the buildings near it and that it housed a private school. According to the Danville-Boyle County Convention and Visitors Bureau, it was constructed around 1820 and was the first brick schoolhouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. The single-story, two-room edifice is built upon a fieldstone foundation with brick laid in common bond and an off-center entrance with a <b>transom</b> above. While Constitution Square was a part of the state park system, the park manager lived in the schoolhouse. After the park's transfer to Boyle County, the schoolhouse was converted into a conference center with meeting space.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light <b>transom</b> and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E

5000|$|The front facade, facing Kirby Street, {{has five}} bays. The center bay has four piers with {{limestone}} bands and an urn at the top. Each floor has {{a pair of}} one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms.</b> The bay {{to the left of}} the center contains the entrance, with two aluminum and glass doors. Two one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms</b> hang on the second floor, surmounted by a weathered plaque reading [...] "Tushiyah United Hebrew Schools of Detroit." [...] The parapet wall has a brick relief in the center. The bay to the right of the center is identical to the entrance bay, but with two one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms</b> on the first floor in place of the entrance doors. The two end bays have two pairs of one-over-one double-hung windows with <b>transoms</b> on each floor. A classical metal cornice once ran the width of the facade, but has been removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has bronze framed, single-glazed, double-hung windows of varying proportions. Typically, {{the first floor}} openings are glazed with double four-over-six sash and are surmounted by fixed <b>transoms.</b> Floors two and seven have double, four-over-six sash without <b>transoms.</b> Floors three through six and eight through ten have paired, double-hung sash with four-over-four lights grouped vertically and separated by fluted bronze spandrels.|$|R
5|$|The Saratoga {{was ordered}} to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and oil {{refinery}} at Surabaya, Java (Operation <b>Transom),</b> and {{the distance from the}} newly renamed East Indies Fleet's base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that the target was outside the Barracuda's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission. Early on the morning of 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The Saratoga and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} 12November {{was the final}} Japanese raid on the Darwin area. As a result, No.1 Wing's flying squadrons {{had little to do}} and the pilots became bored. No.457 Squadron {{conducted}} little operational flying until 8March 1944, when it and No.452 Squadron were ordered to Perth, Western Australia in response to fears that a Japanese naval force would raid the area. The squadrons departed Darwin on 9March and arrived at RAAF Station Guildford (modern Perth Airport) three days later after flying through very difficult weather conditions. No attack eventuated, however, and the squadron returned to Livingstone Airfield between 23 and 28March. The squadron next saw action on 18April when two of its Spitfires took part in an attack on a Japanese radar station in the Babar Islands. In May 1944, No.1 Wing's headquarters and No.57 and 457 Squadrons were deployed to Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia to protect the facilities which had been established to refuel the British Eastern Fleet before Operation <b>Transom,</b> during which the fleet attacked Surabaya, Java. No. 457 Squadron departed for Exmouth Gulf on 10May and returned to its new base at Sattler Airfield on the 24th of the month. The squadron again provided a detachment at Drysdale River Mission from 1June 1944 and began to be reequipped with Mark VIII Spitfires on 2 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the <b>transom</b> window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
50|$|In early Gothic ecclesiastical work, <b>transoms</b> {{are found}} only in belfry {{unglazed}} windows or spire lights, where they were deemed necessary to strengthen the mullions {{in the absence of}} the iron stay bars, which in glazed windows served a similar purpose. In the later Gothic, and more especially the Perpendicular Period, the introduction of <b>transoms</b> became common in windows of all kinds.|$|R
5000|$|The central entrances on {{the first}} and second floors of the north and south {{elevations}} each access a porch. The double-doored entrances of the first floor consist of two-paneled wood doors with two-light <b>transoms</b> and narrow two-light sidelights with wood panels below. The second floor entrances have a single paneled wood door without <b>transoms</b> and slighter wider four-light double-hung operable sidelights.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{elements}} of the scaffolding are the standard, ledger and <b>transoms.</b> The standards, also called uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire mass of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards. <b>Transoms</b> rest upon the ledgers at right angles. Main <b>transoms</b> are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards; intermediate <b>transoms</b> are those placed between the main <b>transoms</b> to provide extra support for boards. In Canada this style {{is referred to as}} [...] "English". [...] "American" [...] has the <b>transoms</b> attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations. Since scaffolding is a physical structure, it is possible to go in and come out of scaffolding.As well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity, these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger braces. To limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base {{to the top of the}} scaffold and fixed at every level.|$|R
25|$|Transoms – These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. The <b>transom</b> located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal <b>transom</b> below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing <b>transom,</b> they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost. The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was the window sill transom; above that, the spar deck <b>transom.</b> The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern.|$|E
25|$|The reverse stern, reverse <b>transom</b> stern, sugar-scoop, or retroussé stern {{is a kind}} of <b>transom</b> stern that is raked {{backwards}} (common {{on modern}} yachts, rare on vessels before the 20th century); the vertical <b>transom</b> stern or plumb stern is raked neither forward nor back, but falls directly from the taffrail down to the wing <b>transom.</b> The rocket ship stern is a term for an extremely angled retroussé stern. A double ended ship with a very narrow square counter formed from the bulwarks or upper deck above the head of the rudder is said to have a pink stern or pinky stern. The torpedo stern or torpedo-boat stern describes a kind of stern with a low rounded shape that is nearly flat at the waterline, but which then slopes upward in a conical fashion towards the deck (practical for small high-speed power boats with very shallow drafts).|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{meaning a}} stake, the word stauros {{was also used}} by writers of the early Christian period {{to refer to a}} {{construction}} with <b>transom.</b>|$|E

50|$|To {{the north}} of the porch is a two-storey mullioned and <b>transomed</b> window flanked with pilasters, and most of the windows to the main façade are also mullioned and <b>transomed.</b> The service wing {{features}} a single-storey octagonal bay. The rear façade features two full-height bay windows, a balustrade at roof level, a cast-iron verandah with a glass roof and a balustraded terrace. The south-east corner has a wall sundial.|$|R
25|$|The facade {{reflects}} Neo-Renaissance elements, {{with its}} bared wall and minimal window decoration. One can notice the original <b>transom</b> above the vehicle entry, {{on the left}} of the elevation.|$|E
25|$|Fitted transoms are {{relatively}} common in pre-historic logboats {{since it is}} much easier to construct a <b>transom</b> and make it watertight than to hollow an entire healthy log.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} {{significant}} {{as one of}} the most well-preserved Queen Anne structures in Stambaugh. It is a two-story, cross-gable house with clapboard siding, patterned shingling in the gables, stained glass <b>transom</b> windows, and a wraparound front porch with Tuscan columns.|$|E

25|$|Following their {{retreat to}} {{the western side of}} the Indian Ocean in 1942, British naval forces did not return to the South West Pacific theatre until 17 May 1944, when an Anglo-American carrier task force {{implemented}} Operation <b>Transom,</b> a joint raid on Surabaya, Java.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} designs today, mullions and <b>transoms</b> {{are normally}} used {{in combination with}} divided-light windows and doors when glazing porches or other large areas.|$|R
50|$|The Queen Anne {{style was}} popularized in the United States after the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. The {{characteristics}} of this style include front-facing or cross-gabled rooflines, multiple building materials, trellised balconies, triptychs, window embellishments and stained glass <b>transoms.</b> Healy's designs included these characteristics, but he often included additional {{details such as}} brightly colored art glass <b>transoms,</b> semicircular openings underneath the gables, or off-center entrances. While the houses share common Queen Anne characteristics, each of these houses has its own unique details.|$|R
