25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% <b>true</b> <b>hemp</b> paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E
50|$|Growing to 3 - 6 m tall by 2 - 4 m broad, S. africana is an {{evergreen}} shrub {{or small}} tree with large pale green leaves 21 cm long and clusters of white flowers {{with red and}} yellow stamens. It is not {{closely related to the}} <b>true</b> <b>hemp,</b> cannabis.|$|E
5000|$|The inner fibers {{are used}} in the making of hats, {{including}} the [...] "Manila hats," [...] hammocks, matting, cordage, ropes, coarse twines, and types of canvas. It is called Manila hemp in the market although it is unlike <b>true</b> <b>hemp,</b> and is also known as Cebu hemp and Davao hemp. Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.|$|E
50|$|Traditional aburatorigami is {{made from}} only the finest grade of the {{blotting}} paper abaca leaf, rather than pulp or rice paper. Although sometimes known as Manila hemp, Cebu hemp, or Davao hemp, the abaca plant {{is not related to}} <b>true</b> <b>hemp.</b> The Philippine Bureau of Fiber and Inspection Service defines a total of 15 grades of abaca, the highest of which are derived from the leaf sheaths located closest {{to the center of the}} abaca stem.|$|E
5000|$|Manila {{paper was}} {{originally}} {{made out of}} old Manila hemp ropes which were extensively used on ships, having replaced <b>true</b> <b>hemp.</b> It was made from Manila hemp (also called abacá) or Musa textilis which is grown in The Philippines and hence the association with Manila, the capital of that country. Abaca is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp, hence the change to that fibre for what is still called Manilla—usually with two [...] "ll"s. More recently new woodpulp has often been replaced with {{a high proportion of}} recycled fibre. True manila hemp folders would have been much tougher and long lasting than modern folders.|$|E
