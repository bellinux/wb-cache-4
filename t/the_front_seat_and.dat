25|$|Cockpit {{accommodation}} {{is provided}} for the pilot in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> two passengers in the rear seat, side-by-side. Unlike the J-3 Cub the PA-12 is flown solo from the front seat.|$|E
25|$|Rufus Youngblood {{was riding}} in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery. Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, Twenty Years in the Secret Service.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Mark C was {{available}} only as either the Standard Tourer or the Deluxe Tourer {{with a single}} bench seat, seating two or three people. The Deluxe version included an electric starter along with rear bumpers. The range was expanded in March 1954, when the Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety versions were added. On these models the bodywork was extended behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and,</b> like the earlier Bond Family Safety Saloon, two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats were added in the gap. Factory advertising material resurrected the Safety label {{as part of this}} model's name, but it was generally dropped elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|There are {{dual-stage}} {{frontal impact}} airbags, torso side-impact airbags built into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> curtain airbags for side-impact protection for {{front and rear}} passengers.|$|R
25|$|Limousine: By definition, a chauffeur-driven {{car with}} a (normally glass-windowed) {{division}} between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rear. In German, the term simply means a sedan.|$|R
25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by 21inches behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|E
25|$|Nissan resumed {{automobile}} production {{starting in}} November 1947 with the Datsun DA series, in a resumed engineering {{cooperation with the}} British Austin Motor Company, who shared various contributions to Nissan. The DA was a very modest and simple car based on the Type 17, with the slightly larger DB series added in March 1948. Nissan also offered commercial vehicles, and the DA was sold as the Datsun 1121 truck, which was essentially the DA with a shortened cab for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> an exposed cargo area attached to the chassis. An open-top roadster/convertible called the Datsun DC-3 appeared 12 January 1952, largely created by Yuichi Ohta. Yuichi {{was the son of}} Hiro Ohta, who founded the Ohta Jidosha car company, which produced cars in Japan between 1934 and 1957, until it became part of Tokyu Kogyo Kurogane shortly thereafter. The Datsun DS appeared in 1950, replacing the DA series.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} replace the {{increasingly}} obsolete de Havilland Mosquito as a night fighter, the Meteor was adapted {{to serve in the}} role as an interim aircraft. Gloster had initially proposed a night fighter design to meet the Air Ministry specification for the Mosquito replacement, based on the two seater trainer variant of the Meteor, with the pilot in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> the navigator in the rear. Once accepted however, work on the project was swiftly transferred to Armstrong Whitworth to perform both the detailed design process and production of the type; the first prototype flew on 31May 1950. Although based on the T.7 twin seater, it used the fuselage and tail of the F.8, and the longer wings of the F.3. An extended nose contained the AI Mk 10 (the 1940s Westinghouse SCR-720) Air Intercept radar. As a consequence the 20mm cannons were moved into the wings, outboard of the engines. A ventral fuel tank and wing mounted drop tanks completed the Armstrong Whitworth Meteor NF.11.|$|E
50|$|The Tatra 77 was a hand-built {{car with}} a leather interior. Some cars had a glass {{partition}} between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>seats.</b> A sliding roof was available.|$|R
50|$|Some cars, {{such as the}} 2010 Volkswagen Polo Mk.5 have {{combined}} head and torso side airbags. These are fitted in the backrest of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> protect <b>the</b> head {{as well as the}} torso.|$|R
60|$|The door-keeper {{looked for}} an instant at the buzzing throng which had settled down upon <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and,</b> {{understanding}} what a difficult task he might be setting himself, evidently decided that Mr. Davis was in the right.|$|R
500|$|Unlike the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which {{flew the}} Phantom with a Naval Aviator (pilot) in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> a Naval Flight Officer as a radar {{intercept}} officer (RIO) {{in the back}} seat, the USAF initially flew its Phantoms with a rated Air Force Pilot in front and back seats. While the rear pilot (GIB, or [...] "guy in back") could fly and ostensibly land the aircraft, he had fewer flight instruments and a very restricted forward view. The Air Force later assigned a rated Air Force Navigator qualified as a weapon/targeting systems officer (later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO) in the rear seat instead of another pilot. However, all USAF Phantoms retained dual flight controls throughout their service life.|$|E
500|$|John A. Williams {{wrote in}} his 1965 book, This Is My Country Too, {{that he did not}} believe [...] "white {{travelers}} have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." [...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars." [...] There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, [...] " [...] people have a way of disappearing on the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Piper J-5 'Cub Cruiser' was a larger, more {{powerful}} {{version of the}} basic Piper J-3 Cub. [...] It was designed just {{two years after the}} J-3 Cub, and differed by having a wider fuselage with the pilot sitting in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> two passengers sitting in the rear seat. Equipped with a 75-hp Continental engine the plane's cruising speed was 75mph. Though officially a three-seater, it would be more accurately described as a [...] "two-and-a-half-seater", as two adults would find themselves quite cramped in wider rear seat. The Cruiser sold for $1,798 when it was first designed.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{equipped}} with six airbags; two for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> passengers, two side impact airbags that deployed from {{the outer edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> side curtain airbags that dropped in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and second row side doors.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are to {{come with}} me, Mrs. Hargreaves," [...] the {{conductor}} said, as he escorted her to one of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> Teddy and Dan stood as if stupefied, gazing in dismay at the sea of faces in front of them.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: The middle {{bench seat}} was dropped for 1999, <b>and</b> a child <b>seat</b> was now {{available}} {{in one of the}} two reclining middle-row buckets.

2500|$|On Sunday, April 8, the Dillingers {{enjoyed a}} family picnic while the FBI had the farm under {{surveillance}} nearby. [...] Later in the afternoon, suspecting {{they were being}} watched (agents J. L. Geraghty and T. J. Donegan were cruising in the vicinity in their car), the group left in separate cars. Billie drove the new Ford V8, with two of Dillinger's nieces, Mary Hancock in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> Alberta Hancock in the back. Dillinger {{was on the floor}} of the car. He was later seen, but not recognized, by Donegan and Geraghty. Eventually, Norman, driving the V8, proceeded with Dillinger and Billie to Chicago, where they separated from Norman.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actuallyâ€¦he had been a gymnast and the muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> my sister, Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E

25|$|The Marlin {{emphasized}} the stretched-out hardtop (pillar-less) roofline {{that followed the}} contemporary styling vogue. Automobile Quarterly magazine thought the car very ugly and expressed dislike for the inadequacy of the rear-view window, {{the positions of the}} steering-wheel and stoplights, the softness of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> design of the pedals.|$|R
50|$|Continental EditionOffered in 2010 and 2011 was the Continental Edition package; {{available}} {{as an option}} only on the Signature Limited trim. The package added Continental badging, chrome 17-inch wheels and accents to the B-pillars.

6000|$|... "England's full of Bits like this," [...] said my uncle, {{leaning over}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> looking back with great satisfaction. The black glare of his goggles rested {{for a time}} on the {{receding}} turrets of Lady Grove just peeping over the trees.|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} resting {{when they saw}} an {{automobile}} truck rumble past them. There were three men on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> the lads were very much {{surprised to see that}} two of them were Jake Tate and the man called Jackson.|$|E
5000|$|The Actual and Active {{are also}} bases for the Actual Van and Active Van, {{which can be}} used as small vans (they also have an {{additional}} safety net behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> removable rear <b>seats).</b> These versions can be identified by small [...] "Van" [...] label on the back door.|$|R
50|$|Soft tops with glass, {{plastic or}} {{flexible}} vinyl windows are used. The common off-road soft top types are: full soft top (covers the interior, doors, and includes windows), halftops (cover the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> doors with windows, backdrop behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> stretch over <b>the</b> rear <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> cargo area), bikini tops (cover the roof area above {{the interior and}} cargo compartment, or just the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats).</b>|$|R
5000|$|From September 1969, {{the base}} 2.5 L-engine was pumped up {{to at the}} same time, both {{remaining}} engines received hydraulic lifters for smoother running, a new exhaust system and six camshaft bearings. The handbrake lever was moved from its position under the dash to a location between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fuel tank was enlarged from 55 to 70 litres.|$|R
60|$|Rosey blushed. It {{was evident}} that she and Uncle James both knew of Clive's love affair. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> {{back seat of the}} {{carriage}} both blushed. And as for the secret, why Mrs. Mackenzie and Mrs. Hobson had talked it a hundred times over.|$|E
60|$|Along {{the narrow}} streak of road, from the southward, they both watched the rapid {{approach}} {{of a large}} motor-car. There were two servants upon <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> one passenger--a man--inside. It swung into the level stretch beneath them, a fantasy of gray and silver in the reflected sunshine.|$|E
60|$|They {{were about}} to start on when a swift team came into sight. The {{carriage}} was a platform-spring wagon, with {{a man and woman}} in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> in the rear a couple of alert young fellows sat holding rifles in their hands and eyeing the plain for game.|$|E
5000|$|The Signum {{platform}} {{is that of}} the Vectra Estate, the wheelbase is longer than the Vectra hatchback/saloon by 13 cm. This provides for very ample rear legroom. Instead of a traditional three passenger bench seat, the Signum has two separate seats in the rear, which can be adjusted in many ways, including sliding back and forth (just like <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats)</b> <b>and</b> reclining backrests.|$|R
50|$|The new {{generation}} Multipla was praised by journalists at its launch for its flexibility. The Multiplaâ€™s three abreast seating configuration allows for adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> removal and relocation {{of the rear}} seats into many formats. It also affords a big 430 L of luggage space, which can increase to 1900 L of flat floor load space, with the rear three seats removed from the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The Omni {{could be}} divided into two categories: the family version and the cargo version. The newer family version has two extra <b>seats</b> {{directly}} behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> facing away towards the rear of the van making it an eight seater. Older versions are modified by individual owners to add additional capacity this way. The cargo version is completely devoid of back seats. Both versions have sliding back doors and hatchbacks.|$|R
