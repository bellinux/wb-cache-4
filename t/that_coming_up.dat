Stevens put the watch and pencil-case in his pocket, and took the little scrap of paper on which so much depended. As Kate handed it to him she saw over his shoulder <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> the lane was a small pony-carriage, in which sat a buxom lady and a very small page. The sleek little brown pony which drew it ambled along at a methodical pace which showed that it was entirely master of the situation, while the whole turnout had an indescribable air of comfort and good nature. Poor Kate had been so separated from her kind that the sight of people who, if not friendly, were at least not hostile to her, sent a thrill of pleasure into her heart. There was something wholesome and prosaic too about this homely equipage, which was inexpressibly soothing to a mind so worn by successive terrors.|$|E

50|$|Another {{controversial}} use of {{the packet}} cluster system is known as cheerleading. A cheerleader {{in this context is}} a station that uses the packet cluster system to spot one particular other station for the purpose of promoting that station's contest operation and improving its score. Cheerleading is most evident when several cheerleaders promote a single station, such as when all the members of a contest club repeatedly and aggressively spot a single contest DX-pedition station operated by several members of their own club. Although the station being spotted is not itself abusing the rules of the contest, it may still benefit from the activity of its friends. Many feel {{that it is difficult to}} differentiate between undesirable cheerleading and the more normal spotting activity, and <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with well-defined rules to prohibit it would have significant negative side effects.|$|E

Playful play as opposed to activities that merge into aggression is characterized by positive mood, intrinsic motivation, occurring in a protected context and easily disrupted by stress.

Numerous functions for play have been proposed and they are by no means mutually exclusive, but some evidence indicates that those individual animals that play most are most likely to survive and reproduce.

40|$|The {{value of}} family {{understood}} {{as a way of}} everyday life and a social institution is highly estimated, so the manner of fulfilling the family roles is controlled by the society. A women’s role of the mother is specifically sensitive from the social point of view. It is widely believed that maternity is the basic social role of a woman and even a social duty. If a woman does not want or cannot fulfil this duty, she is accused of egoism. This paper presents results of empiric research on single childless students and refers to their system of values and plans connected with marriage, procreation, and job. It has turned out, {{that the majority of the}} questioned students want to have more than one child, but they also think <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> to their career expectations may overtake procreation decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} (as its title may indicate) {{trying to cope}} with a problem of {{political}} obligation, which we deem to be at the very centre of political thought. The history of philosophy has proven <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with an indepedent reasoning for the acceptance of a state, its institutions and its legal system is no easy task. We think that "traditional approaches," as we may call them, to the problem of political obligation inevitably fail for various reasons. With this background, we examine the principle of fairness, as an alternative and relatively new approach, and try to establish whether it can withstand a fire of critical scrutiny that has been brought upon it. First, we introduce and reconstruct it from works of John Rawls and George Klosko, and then we scrutinize the critical arguments brought by R. P. Wolff, Robert Nozick and M. B. A. Smith. The ultimate result of our investigation is that we really can hold the principle of fairness as the general foundation of political obligation, at least when we accept some presuppositions about moral theory, because arguments for it are, in the final analysis, sound...|$|E

30|$|Biometric {{verification}} schemes {{perform an}} automatic verification of a user {{based on her}} specific biometric data. They have two main stages: 1) Enrollment stage, and 2) Authentication stage. The user gives her biometric data to the system at the enrollment stage. Then in the authentication stage, she provides her biometric data to the system to prove her identity. Any biometric scheme, which provides binary templates or whose templates can be binarized, {{can be used with}} the proposed threshold homomorphic cryptosystem. Most biometric templates are represented as fixed length real vectors and they can be binarized easily using locality sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques and the most natural and widely used distance in the hash space is the Hamming distance. Previous studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with distance preserving binary hashing is possible [75 – 77]. So, we believe the system we propose {{can be used in a}} broad class of verification systems with minor modification in the system to binarize the templates and use Hamming distance for distance calculation, which will result in minimal loss of security properties in the system (such as equal error rate (EER) etc.). In this paper, we use biohashing as an example algorithm for extracting binary biometric templates. Random projection and thresholding used in biohashing is a well-known type of LSH approach [78]. Although biohashing has its own security and privacy preservation mechanism, we do not rely on these to address the security or privacy concerns.|$|E

Because the material for the students on this semester is telling about future plants, so the researcher chose simple future tense becomes the material in this research. To improve Students understanding on tenses especially simple future tense, the teacher must have a good methods in her/ his teaching. The researcher chose Classroom Action Research for her research. That was because the researcher wants to solve the problem <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> from problem in the classroom. Then, the researcher chose Writing Picture Game becomes a technique that has aim to help students’ understanding on simple future tense.

The purposes of this research are; First, to describe the implementation of the use of Writing Picture Game to improve students’ understanding on simple future tense. Second, it is to know the students’ achievement of using Writing Picture Game to improve students’ understanding on simple future tense. 	Thus classroom action research was done in two cycles with three activities including pre-cycle, cycle 1, and cycle 2. Pre-cycle was got 5. 25, in cycle 1 showed 7. 5, and in 8. 25 in cycle 2. The result of the research showed that there was a significantly different students’ achievement in every cycle.

40|$|In a conversation, {{there is}} always a {{question}} sentence <b>that</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up.</b> It means that there is an interrogative sentence of speakers. Chatting is one of the types of conversations in informal situation. This study analyzed the functions of interrogative sentence, which are used by female boarders at the boarding house and the function that is most frequently used by the boarders. Why the writer chose the conversation at the boarding house, because the topic that female use at will be a natural conversation. Besides, the boarders will more relax when they chat with the other boarders. This research might help the readers in understanding the use of the functions of the interrogative sentences in chatting in order to prevent misunderstanding or misinterpretation. The writer employed descriptive qualitative approach in this study. The data were obtained through recording the subjects at the boarding house while they were chatting for an hour. In analyzing the data, the writer firstly transcribed the collected data into written form. Secondly, she identified the function of the interrogative sentences that are used by the female boarders in chatting at the boarding house. The data then were analyzed by classifying the functions of interrogative sentences according to Yvan Putseys (1994). The findings show that the female boarders mostly used the function of `Seeking Information? (32. 4 %). The second function, which occurred, was `Affirmation or negation? (20. 6 %). The third function is `Suggestion, invitation, or advice? (14. 7 %). The fourth function is `Offering? (11. 8 %). The fifth function is `Mocking? (5. 9 %). The sixth function is `Requesting? (5. 9 %). While the function of `Having a Negative Orientation?, `A Strong Negative Orientation?, and `Impatience or annoyance? (2. 9 %) occurred the three least. From the percentages, it could be noticed that the female boarders mostly used the function of seeking information; it is because women are always curious about anything that happen around them...|$|E
