5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the messages in the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early. When Galatasaray officials arrived at Elland Road {{for the second}} leg, hundreds of Leeds fans attacked the coach busses that were carrying them which delayed the kick-off of the second leg. During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on the match in protest of, what was viewed as, a lack of justice.|$|E

25|$|Nelson's {{speech was}} {{considered}} controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands {{of people who}} had gathered in public spaces in Canberra and Melbourne to hear the apology <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs. There were similar reactions and walk-outs in Sydney and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on traditional conservative policies.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{scored a}} 96-ball 108 not {{out in the}} tied second ODI at Bloemfontein, after which the crowd <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on him as he {{returned}} to the pavilion. This score set his ODI average at an incredible record 234.00. He made 75 at Cape Town, then at East London Pietersen made an unbeaten 100 from only 69 balls, the fastest century by an England player in a one-day match, although England still lost by eight runs. In the final game at Centurion Park, Pietersen came to the wicket at 32/3 and scored 116, but again could not prevent a defeat. Pietersen ended the series, which England lost 4–1, with 454 runs in five innings, and the Player of the Series award. By the end of the series, the South African crowds had generally replaced hostility with respect for Pietersen, his final century being awarded a standing ovation.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} his new policy, Churaman {{apparently}} chose to be passive on the Sinsini affair. Similarly {{in the next few}} years, he applied a restraint on his predatory habits, though local malefactors sometimes indulged in plundering on the roads. Mirza Muhammad emphatically adds that henceforward till the defeat of Jahandar Shah (i.e. from September, 1707 to January 1713) he devoted himself to the imperial service and did not permit any obstructions on the road. Early in 1708, he helped the local naib faujdar, Rahim-ul-la Khan, in suppressing the local Afghan rebels. Having attacked the village of Thiravali (5 miles to the east of OL) he accompanied the Khan in an expedition against the Baloch rebels of Shergarh (20 miles to the north of Mathura). They resisted the invaders for three days but ultimately <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> promising to make over a property worth two thousands to the Jat. This further enhanced his image as a powerful chief. Little wonder, therefore, that greater recognition awaited Churaman.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the first}} two years of her mandate, Jean {{embarked}} on the traditional viceregal tours of Canada's provinces and territories. In British Columbia, Jean presented the Grey Cup at the 93rd Canadian Football League championship game; in Iqaluit, Nunavut, she opened the Toonik Tyme Festival, where she donated eighty books in Inuktitut, French, and English to the Centennial Library in commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday; and, on May 4, 2006, she became the first governor general to address the Alberta legislature. During these tours, Jean also focused strongly on the plight of female victims of violence, meeting with representatives of women's organisations, such as when, in 2007, she participated in a historic private discussion with aboriginal women chiefs and elders at Saskatchewan's Government House. In contrast to her low approval ratings prior to her appointment, crowds were large and welcoming wherever Jean went. Only as her convoy arrived at the National War Memorial for her first Remembrance Day ceremony, on November 11, 2005, were Jean and Lafond greeted with disapproval from an audience, when veterans <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on the Governor General and her consort to show contempt for two people the veterans felt had worked to break up the country they had fought to defend.|$|E
500|$|In Florida, {{events were}} planned in: Gainesville, Miami, Venice, and West Palm Beach. The protests in Miami and Palm Beach were {{organized}} by South Florida Activism and included a gathering at Palm Beach International Airport, where some participants <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to Trump's motorcade {{en route to}} Mar-a-Lago and wore shirts that displayed [...] "No 45". There were around 200 demonstrators who participated by turning their backs on Trump. The Labor Community Roundtable/United Front Against Trump held a peaceful rally at The Torch of Friendship in Miami. About two dozen people attended. In Ocala, the CommonCents Ocala, a {{local chapter of the}} indivisible movement, hosted a rally on East Silver Springs Boulevard by Downtown Square. The event attracted around 80 people. In Port Richey, Trump protesters and supporters stood across the street from each other in a mostly peaceful demonstration.|$|E
500|$|The Scots made {{landfall}} on {{the southern}} shores of Mann. According to the Chronicle of Lanercost and the Chronicle of Mann, the invaders first attempted to resolve the uprising peaceably, demanding that the rebels stand down and submit to Alexander III. The account preserved in these sources suggest that lightly armed and poorly trained rebels were soundly crushed by well-armed Scottish warriors, with the Annals of Lanerost declaring that [...] "the wretched Manxmen <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> and perished miserably". Although the Chronicle of Mann specifies that five hundred thirty seven people were slaughtered by the Scots, {{it is possible that}} this tally owes itself to contemporary poetic convention, as the source further quotes the following rhyming lament: [...] "ten times fifty, three times ten and five and two did fall; O Manx race, beware lest future catastrophe you befall". Although Guðrøðr may have died in the defeat, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum reports {{that he and his wife}} managed to escape the carnage on Mann, and fled to Wales. If correct, this source is one of several that demonstrate strong connections between the Crovan dynasty and Wales spanning the eleventh- and thirteenth centuries.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of {{announcing a}} clear winner, in February 1932 the Council {{declared}} three leading drafts by Boris Iofan, Ivan Zholtovsky and a 28-year-old British architect living in New Jersey, Hector Hamilton.
