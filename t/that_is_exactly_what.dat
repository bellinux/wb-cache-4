5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

25|$|In general, meaning shift {{happens when}} there is a lexical {{implication}} of the society speaking the language so the social situation and the thoughts of the speakers of the languages obliged them to change the meaning of some words so their language could be adapted to their situation and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened in Tunisia. In fact, the borrowing of rhetoric and semantic structures from other contact languages like French helped the meaning shift in Tunisian.|$|E

Geoff Marsh fell off just 14 balls for a disappointing 3, but Mark Taylor and David Boon added 145 for the second wicket, {{although}} it was hard work and slow-going. Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise well made innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94.

25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} written references to Vistulans come from The Life of Saint Methodius, {{also known as}} [...] "The Pannonian Legend", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right {{after his death in}} 885. The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in a foreign land. According to the Pannonian Legend, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> eventually did happen. This passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of Great Moravia and their pagan prince captured. This would have had to have happened during Methodius' second stay in Moravia, between 873 and 885, during the reign of Svatopluk I.|$|E

Appel wrote the Family Guy seventh season episode [...] "Family Gay". Appel co-created, alongside Mike Henry and Seth MacFarlane, the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which they began discussing in 2007 and which premiered September 27, 2009. He and Henry serve as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane. Henry and Appel conceived the show as [...] "more of a family show, a sweeter show" [...] than Family Guy. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. It was extended to a full second season. Appel signed a new three-year, seven figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on The Cleveland Show in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: [...] "What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability. He is a terrific showrunner, and he really sets the tone on a show <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you're looking for." ...|$|E

500|$|Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself, and not {{his love}} interests, was sexually {{objectified}} in this film. A moment where he {{rises from the}} sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in Dr. No; he feels [...] "skewered" [...] by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; [...] "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happens to Bond in [...]" [...] So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, [...] "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market." [...] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of License to Thrill, who also notes Craig's Bond is [...] "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is [...] "humourless," [...] but is also different because [...] "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is [...] "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig {{to be the most}} effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E

2500|$|It is on such {{evidence}} that psychologists assume {{the existence of}} an unconscious psyche – though many scientists and philosophers deny its existence.

But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it does imply – quite correctly. And {{it is one of the}} curses of modern man that many people suffer from this divided personality. It is by no means a pathological symptom; it is a normal fact that can be observed at any time and anywhere. It is not merely the neurotic whose right hand does not know what the left is doing.

2500|$|The 1902 Constitution {{instituted a}} poll tax and {{required}} bulk payment after a voter missed elections, making voting a luxury that poor people, which included many African-Americans, could not often afford.

2500|$|Testing the {{hypothesis}} that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There {{would also be a}} point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during {{a certain period of time}} during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's [...] "point of no return". <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).|$|E
