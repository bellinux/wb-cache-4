When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
500|$|On 24 October Newton, now {{driving a}} Ford saloon, met Scott by {{arrangement}} in Combe Martin, {{just north of}} Barnstaple. Newton explained {{that he had to}} drive to Porlock, about 25 miles away, and suggested that Scott accompany him—he and Scott could talk on the journey. Scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog, a Great Dane called Rinka; this disconcerted Newton, who was afraid of dogs, but Scott insisted that Rinka go with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business. He picked them up shortly after 8pm, and they began the drive back to Combe Martin. On a deserted stretch of road, Newton began to drive erratically, feigning tiredness, and accepted Scott's suggestion that he take over the driving. They stopped; Scott got out, followed by Rinka, and ran round to the driver's side, where he found Newton, gun in hand. Newton shot the dog in the head and, saying [...] "It's your turn now", pointed the gun at Scott. The pistol failed to fire several times; eventually Newton jumped into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> away, leaving Scott and the dead or dying dog by the roadside.|$|E

2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gutiérrez lost 15th {{position}} when Vettel overtook {{him on the}} sixth lap. Vergne, Maldonado, Button and Gutiérrez were placed {{under investigation by the}} stewards for speeding behind the safety car on the following lap. The two Mercedes cars were running close behind each other with Hamilton remaining behind to conserve fuel, and observe the comparison between himself and Rosberg. The tight confines of the middle sector meant Hamilton had difficulty getting into the DRS activation zone before turn 11 and his left-front brake was [...] cooler because of him running behind the safety car. The driver braked heavily for certain corners to prevent glazing. Grosjean steered onto the outside line in an attempt to overtake Vergne for ninth place on the tenth lap but the latter drove defensively to keep the position. It was announced on the following lap that no further action was taken against Button although Vergne, Gutiérrez and Maldonado were handed five-second stop-and-go penalties which were served at their next pit stops. Ricciardo ran closely behind Bottas but did not have the straightline speed to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. On lap 12, Rosberg told his team over the radio that his front-left tyre was heavily worn.Red Bull elected to bring Ricciardo in for his pit stop to change onto medium compound tyres on lap 14 and the Williams team did the same for Massa. The pit stop left Bottas vulnerable to being undercut by Ricciardo and his pace on the lap enabled the latter to draw alongside Massa heading towards the first turn after his pit stop. Bottas gained momentum to pass Ricciarddo around the outside for fourth place. Rosberg made his pit stop from the lead on lap 15 and emerged behind teammate Hamilton in second. Bottas used DRS to attack Ricciardo entering turn 12 but the latter defended his position and did the same three corners later. Hamilton was slower than Rosberg and made his pit stop (lap 17) which saw a front wing adjustment and rejoined with a larger gap to his teammate but was now lapping faster. Ricciardo continued to fend off the faster Bottas who got close to Ricciardo heading into turn 12. Hülkenberg lost power in his engine and was his team instructed him to stop <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> {{to the side of the}} track on the backstraight to retire on lap 18. Alonso overtook Vettel to move into ninth position on the following lap. Gutiérrez left space for Grosjean who braked later than him and passed him for 12th place at turn 12 with Vergne following through.|$|E
