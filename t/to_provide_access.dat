5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, a new partial-access {{interchange}} was built at Wynford Drive <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> between the parkway and the Concorde Place development. The new partial-access interchange {{was paid for}} by the developers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{it crosses}} and {{interchanges}} with Dixon Road and Airport Road, between which it forms the demarcation line. Several ramps diverge {{at this point}} <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to Pearson Airport, and the freeway narrows to eight lanes.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been cut}} with {{irrigation}} channels, and been {{the site of}} burning and peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. The Moss today is common ground, but a track runs through it <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> for local farmers to outlying fields, which surround it. An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E

5|$|The Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be {{travelled}} year-round. Access for oversized vehicles {{requires a}} special permit, and {{is limited to}} daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The -long Kolob Canyons Road was built <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to the Kolob Canyons section of the park. This road often closes in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, the steepest grade the turnpike traversed. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry the turnpike across Bedford Narrows along with US30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and a Pennsylvania Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, the turnpike commission had to purchase land from St. John's Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairways were built {{on either side of the}} turnpike <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to the church.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{engineers}} evaluated {{factors such}} as grading, curve radius and the narrow median used along the Middle Road (which was inaugurated on August 23, 1940, as the Queen Elizabeth Way), and began to plan {{the course of a}} new dual highway mostly parallel to Highway2, with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion. Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built along an existing road, but rather on a new right-of-way, avoiding the need <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to properties.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|The M-203 {{designation}} {{is maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to McLain State Park. The trunkline is not listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways. No section of it {{is located on the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour, although it is the closest state trunkline to Lake Superior in the area. The highway runs through forest lands and city streets most of the way, with the section along the Portage Lake Canal being residential most of the way.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} leaves Cottonwood, it again becomes a divided highway north of Rocking Chair Road, heading into desert. Before {{reaching}} Sedona, SR 89A {{provides access to}} Red Rock State Park. The route remains a divided highway until it reaches Sedona, an arts and resort community known for its red sandstone formations. As it enters the city of Sedona, the route {{is known as the}} Si Birch Memorial Highway. The route continues east through Sedona, providing access to the Sedona Airport. SR 89A continues towards the east through Sedona to an intersection with SR 179, which heads south from this intersection through the southern part of Sedona <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to I-17.|$|E
50|$|State Road 16 (SR 16) {{runs from}} {{northwest}} to southeast between Raiford and St. Augustine. It {{passes through the}} towns of Starke and Green Cove Springs in addition <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Camp Blanding.|$|R

5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor. Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E
5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new draft statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan, or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> to Lower Manhattan. The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E
