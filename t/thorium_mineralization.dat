40|$|The Llandovery Folly Sandstone near Presteigne, Powys, {{contains}} disseminated <b>thorium</b> <b>mineralization.</b> The thorium {{occurs as}} inclusions of thorite and thorianite within sub-millimetre-scale bitumen nodules throughout the sandstone. The nodules grew replacively in situ. The two square kilometres outcrop/subcrop f the sandstone may contain over 500 tonnes thorium...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{correlate}} VLF-EM data with the radiometric measurements to decipher the subsurface structure and to locate uranium mineralization in the shear zone. The study area is around Beldih mine which is an open cast apatite mine located on the South Purulia Shear Zone. VLF method has been applied to map the structure and the presence of radioactive minerals has been delineated by the detection of high α and γ counts with respect to the background radiations. High radiation counts and high surface γ activity are found just above the higher apparent current-density zones in all the profiles studied, at various locations, indicating uranium and/or <b>thorium</b> <b>mineralization</b> as well as good correlation between these techniques...|$|E
40|$|The general {{investigation}} activities of radioactive minerals in Mamuju Area, West Sulawesi is a respon {{of the environmental}} radioactivity measurement result, which shows the existence of high radioactivity value. High radioactive mineral content found in Botteng and Takandeang Villages. From the outcrops, they composed of leucite-basalt rocks; meanwhile the subsurface characteristics of this area are unknown. To characterize the subsurface geology, related to uranium and <b>thorium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in Botteng and Takandeang area, geophysical measurement conducted using resistivity and Induced Polarization (IP) methods. The measurements carried out using Wenner and dipole-dipole configurations. The measurements started {{with the creation of}} six measurement paths where three lines: GF/BTGY- 01, GF/BTGK- 02, and GF/BTGK- 04 are in Botteng and three other lines: GF/TKDK- 01, GF/TKDK- 07 and, GF/TKDY- 06 are in Takandeang. Measurements conducted by crossing the surface radiometric anomaly distribution. The result showed anomaly occurences on autobreccia distribution in GF/TKDY- 6, GF/TKDK- 07, and GF/BTGK- 04 locations. Several mineralization indication on surface identified in GF/BTGK- 0, and GF/TKDK- 01 sections, charaterized by chargeability anomalies more than 25. 14 ms and 81. 4 ms respectively. All significant anomalies are recomended as drilling location...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{characteristics}} {{of development and}} placement uranium-thorium mineralization and distribution of their concentrations in Azov megablock areas are examined. The main structures of Azov megablock areas controlling of distribution of metasomatic types and ore occurrence related with them are set. Preliminary basis for the allocation of boundaries and areas of ore districts is created. Considered theoretical and practical problem associated {{with the establishment of}} regional characteristics, genetic types of mineralization, its structural and temporary accommodation, the development of search criteria and characteristics of mineralization, the release of potentially mineralized areas and study areas of prospecting for Azov megablock of Ukrainian shield. The research is based on data on the geological structure of the PM, and the structural control of the placement lithochemical uranium and thorium anomalies occurrences and deposits, typomorphic properties of minerals, the phase distribution of uranium, thorium. Distribution of uranium and <b>thorium</b> <b>mineralization</b> in areas considered structure is: own minerals, isomorphic impurity in minerals associated with them, or turn on the first to the last. Uranium and thorium PM mineralization is characterized by a genetic (paragenetic) involving mineral associations exogenous and metasomatic rocks. ...|$|E
