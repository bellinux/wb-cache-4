5|$|The Grand Duchy's {{population}} was 65% Polish but with its exclusion of serfs and underrepresentation of landless rural commoners the electoral law {{was designed to}} favor the German inhabitants. The proportion of Polish representatives diminished further after the events of 1848, and Jacek Jędruch notes that due to growing discrimination against Polish representatives that date {{marks the end of}} the period in which this legislative body can be seen as continuing the Polish parliamentary tradition.

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 18th century, marking the age of the Enlightenment in Poland, also {{witnessed}} an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth. Reforms of 1764–1766 improved <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sejm. Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed. The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the liberum veto and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the Cardinal Laws of 1768.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to a study published in <b>the</b> <b>Proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 22 August 2013, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court heard Bo's case. <b>The</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial were relayed in {{real-time}} by the court's official microblog account, though journalists {{covering the}} trial needed {{to belong to}} a pre-approved list. Bo faced three charges: bribery, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The prosectors alleged that Bo received the equivalent of some 21.79 million yuan (US$3.56 million) in bribes from businessmen Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin. At the trial Xu Ming testified that he gave Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge of many of the payments.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in <b>the</b> <b>Proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E

He proffered {{the suggestion that the}} circle had been the site of cremations, with the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli. In August 1909, Gray returned to the site {{for the first time in}} nine years. He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been.|$|E
5|$|It is {{commonly}} and erroneously, {{believed that a}} Sejm was first disrupted by the liberum veto by a Trakai deputy, Władysław Siciński, in 1652. In reality, he vetoed only {{the continuation of the}} Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit. He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent. Over <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted. Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in Kraków, the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the liberum veto before it had finished its deliberations by the Kiev deputy, Adam Olizar. The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the Marshal of the Sejm was elected.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was first}} {{collected}} by Charles Darwin {{during the first}} stop of the second voyage of HMS Beagle at the island of Santiago (St. Iago). It was described for him in 1837 by zoologist John Gould, in <b>the</b> <b>Proceedings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zoological Society of London, and given the name of Pyrgita iagoensis. By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains. The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow.|$|E
