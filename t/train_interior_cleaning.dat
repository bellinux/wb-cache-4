40|$|AbstractPT Garuda Indonesia, Tbk is {{the largest}} airline in Indonesia when it is {{categorized}} from its flying scope and number of passengers carried each year. This study aimed to design proposed improvements to improve the performance of PT Garuda Indonesia's ground handling process, especially for baggage handling, passenger handling, and aircraft <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> activities. Improving efficiency of these operations {{was one of the}} efforts that could be done to realize PT Garuda Indonesia's vision and mission, which strives to provide excellent service to its passengers. In this study, observations of nearly all of the existing activities in the process of baggage handling, passenger handling, and aircraft <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> activities at PT Garuda Indonesia were executed. Data collection was carried out by direct observation through interviews, as well as measuring time using stopwatch, and various manual distance measurements. The results were then analyzed, followed by clustering existing activities into the category of value-added activity, avoidable non-value added activity, unavoidable non-value added activity. Based on the categories that had been made, then analysis of the causes of the emergence of various activities that did not add value to the company was conducted. The methods used to analyze these various causes were 5 Why, 5 W 1 H, and fishbone diagrams. After knowing the causes of various activities that did not add value to the process, then proposals for improvements that could be used by PT Garuda Indonesia were ready to be made...|$|R

50|$|The TTC {{plans to}} extend {{the length of the}} carhouse over tracks 3 and 4 {{on the east side of}} the building. Track 3 is the wash track and track 4 is {{utilized}} for <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> and floor washing of the vehicles. Tracks 3 and 4 are currently long enough for only four-car trains; thus, the overhead doors on the north and south ends of the carhouse need to remain open to service six-car TR trains. The open doors expose equipment to freezing in winter. After the extension, the TTC can also use tracks 3 and 4 for the overnight storage of six-car TR trains.|$|R

50|$|In 1946, Kawasaki Heavy Industries began further {{production}} of the 63 series trains. This version had an aluminium alloy body instead of the steel body in war-time 63 series <b>trains.</b> <b>Interior</b> flooring was wood, luggage racks were installed, and seats were upholstered.

50|$|On average, about 51 train units depart {{and arrive}} at the station from {{different}} parts of the country everyday. Of the 102 trains, a 12 are sent during the day and another 7 at night to the Basin Bridge Train Care Centre for primary maintenance, which involves complete exterior and <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> and total mechanical and electrical overhaul. The rest of the trains go through secondary maintenance or 'other-end attention' at the depot or 'turn back train attention' at Chennai Central itself. Secondary maintenance includes filling water, while the third is the 'other-end attention', in which the train, especially the toilets, is cleaned. The fourth category of trains, such as Sapthagiri Express and Pallavan Express, are turn-back trains, which arrive and leave in a short time from Chennai Central after toilet-cleaning and water-filling is done right at the terminus platform.|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at {{providing}} a methodological {{contribution to the}} concept design of <b>train</b> <b>interior</b> {{in order to improve}} the quality perceived by users in compliance with railway standards. Indeed, the combined use of advanced CAD tools, experimental statistical methods and Virtual Reality tools allows developing, selecting and experimentally evaluating new concepts. The design cycle starts both from designers’ proposal and the identification of user’s needs; then, it makes use of datum-based CAD models in order to generate virtual concepts that satisfy railway standards; the cycle proceeds with the immersive evaluation of virtual prototypes, performed by potential and expert users in Virtual Reality. The identification of the optimal concept closes the design process. This procedure can be iterated in order {{to improve the quality of}} <b>train</b> <b>interiors,</b> evaluated thanks to the user’s involvement in the design cycle.

40|$|This study {{focus on}} noise {{evaluation}} done at LRT Kelana Jaya Line during train operation. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the level of noise during train operation and evaluate the actual level of noise measurement at selected LRT stations. After that, a concept to reduce noise level during train operation was proposed. In addition, the actual level of noise measurement was compared with the theoretical permissible noise based on existing predetermined guidelines and standards. For <b>train</b> <b>interior</b> noise level, sound level meter was installed at front end and gangway by following noise measurement procedure provided by standards and guidelines. For noise at train stations, noise level recorded at different distance from trackside which is 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 meters. The results show that for <b>train</b> <b>interior</b> noise level, most of the time of train operation was exceeded the limitation provided by Prasarana based on standard ISO 3381, 75 dB. The noise level also exceeded noise limit in tunnel which is 80 dB during train operation. For station noise level data, only at distance 2 meter and 4 meter from track can achieve noise level more than 5 dB than limits provided by DOE, about 80 dB. In conclusion, <b>interior</b> <b>train</b> noise level may need to be decrease and at Setiawangsa station has the highest noise level than other stations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{techniques}} and products used by conservators when cleaning historic buildings involve extensive amounts of water, hazardous chemicals or organic solvents. A {{majority of the}} methods are also either very loud or produce {{a great amount of}} dust. This is inappropriate when working in a sensitive historic environment and can constitute significant health and safety violations for both the conservator and the public. New methods and materials are being developed with the purpose to find better-suited {{techniques and}} products for <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> of historic buildings. About five years ago the cleaning system Arte Mundit- poultices was introduced in Sweden, a product which is almost water-free and developed by conservators to avoid problems with water, dust and sound. The interest for this product is not only increasing among Swedish conservators, but also in Europe as a whole. Therefore, it is becoming ever more essential to evaluate both the product itself and its effects. Arte Mundit was originally developed for <b>interior</b> <b>cleaning</b> of for instance stone, concrete and brickwork surfaces, but has in some cases also been tested on polychrome surfaces. However, no investigations have yet been made to examine what impact the products have on this type of material. The main {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to examine if any damage was brought to painted surfaces cleaned by Arte Mundit. The principal components of the Arte Mundit cleaning system were studied and the effectiveness of the efficient substance was analysed through hands-on samples on different types of mural paintings. The study also includes a survey of the use of Arte Mundit in Sweden, from its initial appearance on the market until today. Swedish conservators with experience of working with Arte Mundit were interviewed to map the extent of use and experiences of the product in comparison to traditional cleaning methods for stone as well as mural paintings. The study showed that significant risks are involved when using Arte Mundit on polychrome surfaces. Not only the chemical effects of the product, but also the mechanical/chemical bonding between the latex base and the substrate does in many cases constitute extensive stess and impact on the surface, pigments and medium. This was primarily a problem on damaged surfaces, but also on calcium-based substrates, on high PVK surfaces and on un-varnished oil-films.
