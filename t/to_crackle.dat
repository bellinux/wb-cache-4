60|$|So {{they waited}} for five minutes more, and then set to work quietly, after the fashion of English mastiffs, though, like those mastiffs, they waxed right mad before three rounds were fired, and the white {{splinters}} (sight beloved) began <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> and fly.|$|E
60|$|Tom Kitten {{coughed and}} choked with the smoke; {{he could hear}} the sticks {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{could not}} sleep that night, partly for pure joy, and partly because the {{well-known}} Catherine-wheels inside his eyes had given place <b>to</b> <b>crackling</b> volcanoes of many-coloured fire. 'Spout away,' he said aloud.|$|R
50|$|Basal or basilar <b>crackles</b> (not <b>to</b> be {{confused}} with the basilar artery of the brain) are crackles apparently originating in or near the base of the lung. Bibasal or bibasilar <b>crackles</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>crackles</b> at the bases of both the left and right lungs. Bilateral basal <b>crackles</b> also refers <b>to</b> the presence of basal crackles in both lungs.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades or so, we have learned how <b>to</b> {{understand}} <b>crackling</b> noise {{in a wide variety of}} systems. We review here the basic ideas and methods we use <b>to</b> understand <b>crackling</b> noise - critical phenomena, universality, the renormalization group, power laws, and universal scaling functions. These methods and tools were originally developed to understand continuous phase transitions in thermal and disordered systems, and we also introduce these more traditional applications as illustrations of the basic ideas and phenomena.

5000|$|King's closest aids {{contacted}} Robert Lewis Jr. {{to retrieve}} the body and prepare it for viewing. The autopsy was completed at around 11:00 p.m., and at 11:15 p.m. King's body arrived at the R.S. Lewis & Sons Funeral Home. The assassins' bullet, {{as well as the}} subsequent autopsy, had caused significant damage to King's neck and face, and both Robert Jr. and Clarence labored through the night embalming, grooming and preparing King's body - while listening <b>to</b> <b>crackling</b> recordings of King's speeches. Ralph Abernathy commented [...] "the body appeared unblemished. The morticians had done their job well." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{difficult}} to light the stove. The cabin trickled with moisture like a dripping-well. Grate and wood were wet; and when at last the fire began <b>to</b> <b>crackle,</b> Jimmy had to kneel on a locker as he held the kettle on, {{in order to keep}} his feet out of the water which washed up from the bilge. There seemed to be a good deal of it.|$|E
60|$|A {{crackling}} sound grew to distinctness, and therewith a leaping of faint flashes {{along the}} edge of the further ways. By their light Graham saw the heads and bodies of a number of men, armed with weapons like those of his guards, leap into an instant's dim visibility. The whole area began <b>to</b> <b>crackle,</b> to flash with little instantaneous streaks of light, and abruptly the darkness rolled back like a curtain.|$|E
60|$|Even {{through the}} {{darkness}} {{it was easy to}} perceive groups of people either rushing backwards and forwards on the Place or congregating in groups under the trees. Excitement was in the air. It could be felt and heard right through the soughing of the north-westerly wind which caused the bare branches of the trees to groan and <b>to</b> <b>crackle,</b> and the dead leaves, which still hung on the twigs, to fly wildly through the night.|$|E
50|$|The show's ninth season premiered on January 5, 2017. That {{same month}} it was {{announced}} that the series would migrate from <b>Crackle</b> <b>to</b> Netflix, with the ninth season being the final one <b>to</b> premiere on <b>Crackle.</b> Twenty-four new episodes will stream on Netflix in 2017 and 2018, with all previous episodes made available on the streaming service.|$|R
60|$|Later, beside him, I {{lay awake}} a while, {{watching}} the sparks fly, and the shadows flit, feeling the cold wind on my face, listening <b>to</b> the <b>crackle</b> {{of the fire}} and {{the roar of the}} gale.|$|R

60|$|These, {{and such}} undeveloping leaves, {{wherever}} they occur, are called 'bracts' by botanists, a good word, from the Latin 'bractea,' meaning {{a piece of}} metal plate, so thin as <b>to</b> <b>crackle.</b> They seem always a little stiff, like bad parchment,--born to come to nothing--a sort of infinitesimal fairy-lawyer's deed. They {{ought to have been}} in my index at p. 255, under the head of leaves, and are frequent in flower structure,--never, as far as one can see, of the smallest use. They are constant, however, in the flower-stalk of the whole violet tribe.|$|E
60|$|Directing Manytongues {{to secure}} the two incendiaries, I sprang {{into the kitchen to}} {{extinguish}} the flames. It was high time, though Mary Warren had already anticipated me here, too. She had actually thrown several dippers of water upon the fire, which was beginning <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> through the pile of chairs, and had already succeeded in lessening the flames, I knew that a hydrant stood in the kitchen itself, which gave a full stream of water. Filling a pail, I threw the contents on the flames; and repeating the application, in half a minute the room was filled with vapor, and to the bright light succeeded a darkness that was so deep as to suggest the necessity of finding lamps and candles.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{became more}} difficult, {{the wind was}} getting stronger, {{and there was no}} sign of the shack. Perhaps he had gone too far to the south. He {{inclined}} to the right, but that brought him to nothing that might serve as a guide; there was only smooth snow and the white haze whirling round him. He turned more to the right, growing desperately afraid, stopped once or twice to ascertain by the way the snow drove past whether he was wandering from his course, and plodded on again savagely. At last something began <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> beneath his feet. Stooping down, he saw that it was stubble, and he became sensible of a vast relief. He could not be more than a few minutes walk from the shack.|$|E
50|$|In his oil-on-masonite works, Walker simulates {{the effects}} of time by using a resist {{technique}} of his own creation <b>to</b> instil <b>crackles</b> and scratches over elegant brush techniques. Each new work is numbered, the numbers dating back over 20 years.|$|R
50|$|To play treshchotka {{one would}} hold {{it by the}} ends with both hands, {{generally}} at the chest or head high and alternate the motion between brusque and smooth <b>to</b> produce <b>crackling</b> and clicking sounds. This technique not only attracts listener by its sounds but also adds visual spectacle effect.|$|R
40|$|A realtime {{model for}} the {{synthesis}} of crumpling sounds is presented. By capturing the statistics of short sonic transients which give rise <b>to</b> <b>crackling</b> noise, it allows for a consistent description of {{a broad spectrum of}} audible physical processes which emerge in several everyday interaction contexts. The model drives a nonlinear impactor that sonifies every transient, and it can be parameterized depending on the physical attributes of the crumpling material. Three different scenarios are described, respectively simulating the foot interaction with aggregate ground materials, augmenting a dining scenario, and affecting the emotional content of a footstep sequence. Taken altogether, they emphasize the potential generalizability of the model to situations in which a precise control of auditory feedback can significantly increase the enactivity and ecological validity of an interface...|$|R
60|$|Old Wally was afield too; but, {{so far as}} I {{could read}} from the woods' record, he fared no better than I {{on the trail of}} the buck. Once, when I knew my game was miles ahead, I heard the longdrawn whang of Wally's old gun across a little valley. Presently the brush began <b>to</b> <b>crackle,</b> and a small doe came jumping among the trees {{straight}} towards me. Within thirty feet she saw me, caught herself {{at the top of her}} jump, came straight down, and stood an instant as if turned to stone, with a spruce branch bending over to hide her from my eyes. Then, when I moved not, having no desire to kill a doe but only to watch the beautiful creature, she turned, glided a few steps, and went bounding away along the ridge.|$|E
60|$|Crouching low, {{crawling}} {{on hands and}} knees, and slipping from trunk to trunk, the pair worked backward in a semicircle, though, instead of following, it was the negro who led the white man. It seemed to Dane that he was making noise enough to waken the dead, but his dusky companion had probably owed his life to his powers of silent motion, and his progress was as noiseless {{as that of a}} serpent. Still, a clamor which broke out {{at the rear of the}} camp drowned the sound of Dane's passage, and presently a fire commenced <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> behind the serried trunks. Rising partly upright, he could see naked figures outlined against it flitting with burdens on their heads into the swamp. Nevertheless, Maxwell's instructions were explicit, and, when the negro beckoned, he sank down again.|$|E
60|$|Now one {{can usually}} hear the thudding of the axe {{a mile or}} more in {{the stillness of the}} woods that is not silence to the bushman's ear. Their voice is always musical, and the sounds that man makes jar through its harmonies, but only a forest rancher or free {{prospector}} would have caught the muffled sound, that was lost in the song of the pines a few score yards from Alton's camp. He knew where to find the resinous knots with their sticky exudations, and was a master of the axe, while it was noticeable that when the fire commenced <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> he stood still and listened again before he went down to the river with the kettle. Nor did he at once return into the light, but slipped for a moment behind a wide-girthed trunk. It was only a deer he heard moving along the hillside above him, and there was nothing visible but the row of stupendous columns that appeared and vanished as the red light rose and sank. Alton set the kettle down amidst the flame, and unrolling one of the packages laid out his supper.|$|E

50|$|Pork {{has been}} a Danish {{favourite}} for centuries but {{it was after the}} Industrial Revolution in the 1860s when wood-fired ovens were introduced for use in the home that, in addition to sausages and hams, roast pork became a popular dish. From the beginning, joints were always cooked together with the rind in order <b>to</b> provide <b>crackling.</b> Ever since, this has remained a prerequisite for the dish.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said he, in a jocular tone, {{for it was}} a most unusually severe {{accident}} indeed that could drive {{the fun out of}} our little friend--"you see, after I lost sight of Jack, I took a leaf out of the hare's book, and doubled on my course. This brought me, unhappily, to the banks of the river, where I came upon one of the pitfalls that are made by the niggers here to catch wild beasts, and in I went. I kept hold of the surface boughs, however, scrambled out again, and pushed on. But I had not gone ten yards when the ground began <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> and sink. I made a desperate bound to clear it, but my foot caught in a branch, and down I went head foremost into the pit. And that's the whole of my story. How long I remained there I know not. If I had known what time it was when I dived in, and you were to tell me what o'clock it is now, we might arrive at a knowledge of the time I have spent at the bottom of that hole. All that I can positively affirm is, that I went in, and within in the last ten minutes I came out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next moment}} {{he heard the}} door close and knew that the cook had gone to make the cakes ready as she said. And as he looked down {{he saw that the}} boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that he had brought in upon the punk into a flame. The dry fagots began <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> and blaze. [...] "Now is my time," [...] said Hans to himself. Bracing his elbows against each side of the chimney, he {{straightened}} his legs so that he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that fell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly, whereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold upon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet {{in the midst of the}} burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor, where he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as dough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful inky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then his scattered wits came back to him. [...] "It is the evil one," [...] he roared. And thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to the door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down the passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind him.|$|E
60|$|Nance {{stayed for}} no more bidding. In her own room, by the glimmer of the twilight, she washed her hands and pulled on her Sunday mittens; {{adjusted}} her black hood, and tied a dozen times its cherry ribbons; and in less than ten minutes, with a fluttering heart and excellently bright eyes, she passed forth under the arch and over the bridge, into the thickening shadows of the groves. A well-marked wheel-track conducted her. The wood, which upon {{both sides of the}} river dell was a mere scrambling thicket of hazel, hawthorn, and holly, boasted on the level of more considerable timber. Beeches came to a good growth, with here and there an oak; and the track now passed under a high arcade of branches, and now ran under the open sky in glades. As the girl proceeded these glades became more frequent, the trees began again to decline in size, and the wood to degenerate into furzy coverts. Last of all there was a fringe of elders; and beyond that the track came forth upon an open, rolling moorland, dotted with wind-bowed and scanty bushes, and all golden brown with the winter, like a grouse. Right over against the girl the last red embers of the sunset burned under horizontal clouds; the night fell clear and still and frosty, and the track in low and marshy passages began <b>to</b> <b>crackle</b> under foot with ice.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{checked her}} filly and looked up, with an {{unconscious}} but alarmed air, {{at the very}} cause of their danger, while she listened <b>to</b> the <b>crackling</b> sounds that awoke {{the stillness of the}} forest; but the next instant her bridlet was seized by her father, who cried, “God protect my child!” and she felt herself hurried onward, impelled by the vigor of his nervous arm.|$|R
25|$|Both {{before and}} since DAB launched, other mediums of {{transmitting}} {{and listening to}} the radio have expanded. In 1989, cable television subscribers in the Saltash area could hear some BBC Radio stations on their television sets for the first time. With the expansion of digital cable television, many more radio stations have been added. With the expansion of satellite television too, many stations, including others from the European continent and beyond are available. The BBC added radio to UK Gold in 1993 on the Astra satellite, and subsequent satellites and services have been extended since then. The expansion of Freeview, and its subsequent replacement in Cornwall in 2009 of existing analogue television services is perhaps going to have the greatest impact. The internet, with thousands of radio stations streaming online, and the expansion of broadband has meant that radio reception has diversified in the number of stations that can be heard, and it is no longer restricted <b>to</b> <b>crackles</b> and night time fading of a few stations of old.|$|R
2500|$|Variable {{resistors}} {{can also}} degrade {{in a different}} manner, typically involving poor contact between the wiper and {{the body of the}} resistance. This may be due to dirt or corrosion and is typically perceived as [...] "crackling" [...] as the contact resistance fluctuates; this is especially noticed as the device is adjusted. This is similar <b>to</b> <b>crackling</b> caused by poor contact in switches, and like switches, potentiometers are to some extent self-cleaning: running the wiper across the resistance may improve the contact. Potentiometers which are seldom adjusted, especially in dirty or harsh environments, are most likely to develop this problem. When self-cleaning of the contact is insufficient, improvement can usually be obtained through the use of contact cleaner (also known as [...] "tuner cleaner") spray. The crackling noise associated with turning the shaft of a dirty potentiometer in an audio circuit (such as the volume control) is greatly accentuated when an undesired DC voltage is present, often indicating the failure of a DC blocking capacitor in the circuit.|$|R
