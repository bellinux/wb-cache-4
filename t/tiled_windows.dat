25|$|Windows 2.0 was {{released}} in December 1987, and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management. Windows 2.03 changed the OS from <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory.|$|E
50|$|Even though i3 is a tiling window manager, {{specific}} windows such as password pop-ups are not displayed as new tiles by default: {{they are}} stacked {{in front of}} <b>tiled</b> <b>windows.</b> These floating windows can be moved and resized freely, just like in popular desktop environments like GNOME or KDE.|$|E

40|$|Windowing systems seem {{to provide}} {{promising}} alternatives to display massive information for multi-tasking and real-time control systems. However, {{the benefits of}} windowing systems might be offset by the workload resulting from window management. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the relative advantages of <b>tiled</b> <b>window,</b> overlapping window, and twin monitors for high-demand and low-demand information-processing shop-floor control tasks.

50|$|Either {{end of the}} {{building}} has multi-paned casement <b>windows,</b> with <b>tiled</b> <b>window</b> hoods to the ground level. The northwest end has a basement laundry, and an awning linking an adjacent single-storeyed brick residence to the northwest. The northeast rear elevation has centrally positioned enclosed verandahs to both levels, with stucco finish, casement windows, and window hoods to the ground level. The enclosed verandahs are accessed from either end by metal framed stairs.|$|R
5000|$|Windows 2.0 allowed {{application}} {{windows to}} overlap each other unlike its predecessor Windows 1.0, which could display only <b>tiled</b> <b>windows.</b> Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard-shortcuts and the terminology of [...] "Minimize" [...] and [...] "Maximize", {{as opposed to}} [...] "Iconize" [...] and [...] "Zoom" [...] in Windows 1.0. The basic window setup introduced here would last through Windows 3.1. Like Windows 1.x, Windows 2.x applications cannot be run on Windows 3.1 or up without modifications since they were not designed for protected mode. Windows 2.0 {{was also the first}} Windows version to integrate the control panel.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft first {{presented}} Windows to {{the public}} on November 10, 1983. Requiring two floppy disk drives and 192 KB of RAM, Microsoft described the software as a device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. By supporting cooperative multitasking in <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS system calls, and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and Apple Computer's Lisa by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers {{did not need to}} use Unix to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft user interface in their applications.|$|E
50|$|Late in 1984, Steve Ballmer, who {{had become}} Tandy's boss, asked him to take over retail {{marketing}} responsibility for Microsoft Windows. IBM had rejected licensing Windows in favor of their own character based windowed app manager called TopView, but Microsoft continued with development of a graphical user interface. Windows 1.0 shipped in fall of 1985. That version of Windows bears a scant resemblance to today's version since it had to run on CGA cards which had a resolution of 320×200 pixels, and prior to Tandy taking over it had been decided to use <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> rather than overlapping ones {{as it had in}} its original design. Tandy wrote the specs for a set of desktop applets including a Paint program, simple word processor called Windows Write, Calculator, Reversi game, Notepad, File Manager, and Calendar program. He also defined a way to change system parameters using an app called the Control Panel.|$|E

50|$|Dressler {{was mainly}} {{responsible}} for the decorative architectural panels, many of which can still {{be seen in the}} local area of Birkenhead and Liverpool, {{as well as in the}} local museums. The brightly coloured panels, inspired by the work of the Florentine sculptor Luca della Robbia and his family, did not prove to be very popular on the dark brick buildings of the period, the pottery turning to large two-handled vases, presentation wares, wall chargers and plates, as well as ceramic clock cases, <b>tiled</b> <b>window</b> boxes, numerous types of vases and similar wares, as a source of income. Dressler left the pottery in 1897 to establish his own pottery, the Medmenham Pottery, in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.|$|R
5000|$|Next in 1983 came Andrew WM, a {{complete}} <b>tiled</b> <b>windowing</b> system later replaced by X11. Microsoft's Windows 1.0 (released in 1985) also used tiling (see sections below). In 1986 came Digital Research's GEM 2.0, a windowing {{system for the}} CP/M which used tiling by default. One of the early (created in 1988) tiling WMs was Siemens' RTL, up to today a textbook example because of its algorithms of automated window scaling, placement and arrangement, and (de)iconification. RTL ran on X11R2 and R3, mainly on the [...] "native" [...] Siemens systems, e.g., SINIX. Its features are described by its promotional video. The Andrew Project (AP or tAP) was a desktop client system (like early GNOME) for X with a tiling and overlapping window manager.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that overlapping windows are preferable to tiled (non-overlappingi ones, but {{there is very little}} research to Support that belief. An analysts of the basic characteristics of windowing reg$nes predicts that there are. in fact. situations where overlapping windows are inferior to tiled. An experiment to test this prediction verified that there are rndeed tasks and users for which <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> yield faster performance. This result suggests a need for closer study of the principles underlying. windowing regimes, so that designers havea better understanding of the tradeoffs involved in using them. 1...|$|E
40|$|Genomic DNA {{sequences}} {{associated with}} human-specific functions should show a signature of positive selection, whereas those needed in all primates should show a signature of negative selection. One test for natural selection (either positive or negative) {{that has been}} applied to protein-coding regions requires a ratio of intraspecies polymorphism to interspecies divergence that deviates significantly from the neutral expectation. By applying this test to noncoding regions of human DNA, using ancestral repeats in <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> as a model for neutral DNA, we found that about 1. 0 to 1. 6 % of the human genome deviates significantly from neutrality based on comparisons to rhesus (diverging about 23 million years ago) or chimpanzee (diverging about 6 million years ago), respectively. Most of these non-neutral windows show a signal for positive selection. Many of them overlap with genes such as FOXP 2 whose coding regions were previously implicated as being targets of positive selection in humans, and others overlap with novel candidates for selection, such as the nerve growth regulator NEGR 1. These noncoding regions that are candidates for targets of selection could harbo...|$|E
40|$|The pluripotency control regions (PluCRs) {{are defined}} as genomic regions that are bound by POU 5 F 1, SOX 2, and NANOG in vivo. We {{utilized}} a high-throughput binding assay to record more than 270, 000 different DNA/protein binding measurements along incrementally <b>tiled</b> <b>windows</b> of DNA within these PluCRs. This high-resolution binding map is then used to systematically define the context of POU factor binding, and reveals patterns of cooperativity and competition in the pluripotency network. The most prominent pattern is a pervasive binding competition between POU 5 F 1 and the forkhead transcription factors. Like many transcription factors, POU 5 F 1 is co-expressed with a paralog, POU 2 F 1, that shares an apparently identical binding specificity. By analyzing thousands of binding measurements, we discover context effects that discriminate POU 2 F 1 from POU 5 F 1 binding. Proximal NANOG binding promotes POU 5 F 1 binding, whereas nearby SOX 2 binding favors POU 2 F 1. We demonstrate by cross-species comparison and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that the contextual sequence determinants learned in vitro are sufficient to predict POU 2 F 1 binding in vivo...|$|E

50|$|Workspace management: The Blender GUI builds its own <b>tiled</b> <b>windowing</b> {{system on}} top of one or {{multiple}} windows provided by the underlying platform. One platform window (often sized to fill the screen) is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender's views or window-types. The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows, called screens, and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts. Each window-type's own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate 3D view. For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons using similar controls one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout is fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or UV mapping or texturing by hiding features not used for the task.|$|R
50|$|Structures are {{typically}} {{based on a}} rectangular floor plan, and feature massive, symmetrical primary façades. Stuccoed walls, red <b>tiled</b> roofs, <b>windows</b> {{in the shape of}} arches or circles, one or two stories, wood or wrought iron balconies with window grilles, and articulated door surrounds are characteristic. Keystones were occasionally employed. Ornamentation may be simple or dramatic. Lush gardens often appear.|$|R

WM was meant to be licensed under reasonable terms, which CMU thought would resemble a relatively cheap UNIX license, while IBM sought a more lucrative licensing scheme. WM was later replaced by X11 from MIT. Its developers, Gosling and Rosenthal, would next develop the NeWS (Network extensible Window System).|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} is located between {{the tracks and}} Union Place. It is a three-story rectangular building in rough-faced Portland brownstone with two smaller, similarly shaped two-story wings on the north and south.

5000|$|The theatre {{is built}} {{to the street}} {{alignments}} and occupies {{the whole of the}} site. The front facade is two storeys in height, of rendered brick, and decorative, with strong streetscape presence. In an extraordinarily eclectic metaphorical mix typical of 1920s picture theatre architecture, the facade combines a mix of [...] "Classical" [...] and [...] "Mediterranean" [...] decorative and design elements. There are five bays, not of equal width, defined by pilasters, at the top of which are decorative concrete urns. A balustraded concrete pediment unites the two bays either side of the central bay. This middle bay is wider and taller, with a high pediment with the name TRIUMPH in rendered block lettering. Below the theatre name is a cantilevered <b>tiled</b> <b>window</b> hood above a bank of five-paned casement windows with opaque, green and amber Arctic glass. Behind these windows is the original bio-box. In the bays either side are pairs of similar casement windows, with similar window hoods above. At street level there is a centrally placed wide, low-arched entrance, defined by half pillars on each side, with concrete steps leading to what was formerly a semi-open foyer. This has been partly enclosed with later timber-framed glass doors, recessed from the arch entrance. To either side of this arched entrance is a billboard case, and in the end bays are small [...] "porthole" [...] windows with a square leadlight panel in each, now enclosed with timber lattice.|$|R
50|$|Decorative {{features}} to both frontages include gargoyles, twisted columns between arched windows and to principal doorways, and arched cornices to gables, {{the tower and}} the campanile. A three-storeyed annex extends to the north-east, sitting a half a storey below {{the rest of the}} building; it has a hipped roof, rectangular <b>windows,</b> <b>tiled</b> awnings to the south and a timber porch to the north.|$|R

5000|$|Red Lodge has an {{irregular}} cruciform plan {{and is in}} Tudor Revival style. It is in two storeys, the lower storey being in sandstone, and the upper storey in timber framing and painted brick. The house has a red-tiled roof, and each front has a gabled and jettied upper floor. The entrance is on the east side, and has a porch with a lean-to <b>tiled</b> roof. The <b>windows</b> are mullioned. There are two chimney stacks, the one to the west containing a decorative panel with the initials [...] "R. B." [...] and the date 1870.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{known as}} Greenoaks, Bishopscourt was {{designed}} by Edmund Blacket. A cottage originally occupied the site, and the owner, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, built the sandstone Gothic Revival mansion around this building, circa 1850-1860. Further extensions were made in 1935 after being designed by Leslie Wilkinson. The exterior features Tudor windows and carved doors and crests. The interior {{was based on the}} Palace of Westminster and is considered to be an outstanding example of Blacket's work, with stained-glass <b>windows,</b> <b>tiled</b> floors, an elaborate staircase and panelled library. The house was later acquired by the Anglican Church of Australia and became the official residence of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{planning of}} the house is substantially intact and later additions are clearly articulated. Verandahs on the north and east have been enclosed and the building is entered from a doorway on the north-eastern elevation. Many of the rooms have been lined with hardboard and fibro. Several large, well proportioned rooms with high ceilings have elements of original fabric remaining, these include pressed metal ceilings, leadlight <b>windows,</b> <b>tiled</b> fireplaces and other decorative elements. There are original doors throughout, these are generally four panel doors with Art Nouveau style finger plates and lock furniture. There are a number of styles of windows, including many timber sash windows and a variety of recent styles such as sliding and casement windows.|$|R
60|$|As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was {{comfortable}} and compact; {{but as a}} cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the roof was <b>tiled,</b> the <b>window</b> shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind. On {{each side of the}} entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each {{for the sake of the}} others resolved to appear happy.
