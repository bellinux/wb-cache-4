5|$|Arbroath has two {{secondary}} schools, Arbroath High School and Arbroath Academy. The {{high school}} (the older of the two), was originally a grammar {{school and the}} academy a comprehensive. The academy is located near the Mayfield area and the high school near Keptie Pond. Both schools are well regarded with exam results along reading and writing performance indicators above the national average. Arbroath High is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two with around 1,200 pupils, and the Academy being smaller with around 600 pupils.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Tacoma eclipsed Seattle to become the largest port in the state and 7th largest in the nation, but fell behind ports in Los Angeles and nearby Vancouver. In 2009, Seattle regained its title as <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the ports, but both {{suffered}} losses in overall cargo volume and revenue. Tacoma lost Maersk to Seattle after it merged with CMA-CGM in 2009, but three years later attracted an alliance of three major international shippers from Seattle who had comprised 20 percent of cargo for the port.|$|E
5|$|In one experiment, when offered live {{fruit flies}} (Drosophila virilis), {{salamanders}} choose <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is irrespective of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight and movement, although discrimination among large numbers may {{be based on}} surface area.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{estimates}} for Kepler-9b's mass were refined by the W. M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In doing so, scientists found that Kepler-9b is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two gas planets {{discovered in the}} Kepler-9 system, although in mass it is smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E
5|$|K'inich B'aaknal Chaak was enthroned in 688, {{twenty years}} after Ruler 2, and reigned for twenty-seven years. During his reign he {{restored}} Toniná's power {{with a number of}} military victories over Palenque, and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for regional power. Ballcourt 1, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> Toniná's two ballcourts, was dedicated in 699 to celebrate three victories over the city's arch-rival. The ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives, all vassals of the enemy Palenque king from the Usumacinta region. The date of the king's death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The AERA {{essentially}} collapsed {{after its}} acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations {{were created in}} its aftermath. Two days after the convention, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and their allies formed the competing American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The AWSA initially was <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two organizations, but it declined in strength during the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The Professional District {{is located}} {{northeast}} {{and east of}} the university campus. The district has facilities of the University of Houston Law Center, the Cullen College of Engineering, and the C.T. Bauer College of Business. This area of campus is home to Calhoun Lofts, which is an upper-level and graduate housing facility. The East Parking Garage {{is located on the}} east end of the district. Adjacent to the district is the University Center (UC), <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> two student unions on campus.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{northern}} wing originally {{contained a}} dining hall, {{but this was}} later divided up to make more luxurious quarters for the Prince Bishop. This area {{is also home to}} the two chapels of the college. The Norman Chapel dates from the 11th century and is the oldest accessible part of the castle, and retains its original Saxon architectural style. The Tunstal Chapel is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two; it dates from the 15th century and is named after Cuthbert Tunstal. Both chapels are used for worship within the college.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{population is}} <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two.

5|$|The sejms in Warsaw {{were held}} in the Warsaw Castle, within the Chamber of Deputies (Hall of Three Pillars), with the upper Senate Chamber located {{literally}} above it. In the late 17th century, new quarters were constructed for the Chamber of Deputies, and were joined {{on the same level}} by the senate quarters in the mid-18th century. The new Senate Chamber was <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two, as it was intended to host both chambers during the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} sandy beaches at both St Mildred's Bay and West Bay. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the beaches is at St Mildred's Bay, {{where it is}} {{possible}} to hire beach huts, deck chairs and jet-skis. The beach is a short distance from tennis courts and a golf putting course. At West Bay, there are many small rock pools, which are popular with children. Each beach has nearby cafés, restaurants and public houses, and a European Blue Flag Award is shared between them due to their cleanliness and safety.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} Faversham Abbey {{are the two}} barns at Abbey Farm. Minor Barn was built around 1425; Major Barn, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two, dates from 1476. Next to the barns is the Abbey Farmhouse, part of which dates from the 14th century. The Abbey Guest house, {{on the east side}} of the Abbey's Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden's House. This house, now a private residence in Abbey Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|Group C lies to the {{southwest}} of Group B and east of Group E. Group C is arranged around two large structures (C1 and C2). It possesses two small plazas; the East Plaza is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two, enclosing an area {{to the east of}} the main temple, Pyramid C1. The East Plaza was accessed via a narrow alley that ran between a large, low platform and a high-status residential structure with a patio (C8). An inset stairway climbed outside of the retaining wall of Group C and accessed the East Plaza between the high-status residence and a platform to its east. The West Plaza is located behind Platform C2 and is enclosed to the north by three platforms (C9, C10 and C17).|$|E
5|$|Players of Donkey Kong Country control {{one of two}} {{characters}}: Donkey Kong or {{his nephew}} Diddy. The player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. Donkey is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two, and can defeat enemies more easily while Diddy is faster and more agile. In several levels, players can gain assistance from various animals, who are found by breaking open crates. These helpers include Rambi the Rhino, Expresso the Ostrich, Enguarde the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot. Each animal {{can be found in}} an appropriately themed level: for example, Enguarde can only be found underwater, and Squawks is found in one cave level. Some animals can also give players access to bonus games.|$|E

5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E
5|$|The Hastings Chapel {{contains}} {{a number of}} family monuments, including a large alabaster tomb for Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1561, and his countess, Catherine. The monument was carved by Joseph Pickford to a design by William Kent. A memorial to Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1746, is on the east wall and is by Michael Rysbrack. His widow, Selina, founded a training college for evangelical ministers, and a sculpture of her in mourning, also by Rysbrack, is placed by her husband's memorial. The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>of</b> two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel, and the smaller and older one is under their chapel.|$|E
