5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at the floor of <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> {{along with some of}} stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to <b>the</b> <b>basket).</b> From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E

Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E

5|$|In a December 22, 1990, {{win against}} in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted {{a new career}} high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point {{attempts}} of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E

Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove to <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, {{kept up with}} Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E

5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which {{one or two}} divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E

5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces before making <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor {{before entering the}} hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E

Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
