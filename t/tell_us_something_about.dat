[...] Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, [...] "the movie was over before {{it struck me that}} the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Bloom {{published}} The Western Canon, {{a survey}} of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon. Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the [...] "School of Resentment", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by [...] "forces of resentment" [...] of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: [...] "The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools." [...] His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> feminism and Marxism, he says, but probably nothing about Hamlet itself.|$|E

Is it really necessary {{for us to take}} serious notice of this proposition? It is, and for three reasons. First, because it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the primal origin of all things; second, because it does so in language devoid of image or fable, and finally, because contained in it, if only embryonically, is the thought, [...] "all things are one." ...|$|R

The general message that Professor Jones disseminates in his articles is important.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the question of}} disciplinary variation by focusing on {{a few of the}} ways voice operates in academic discourse. In it I take the position that while all academic discourse actively endeavors to convey knowledge persuasively, such conveyance often differs considerably across disciplines.

50|$|Pay-per-click, {{along with}} cost per {{impression}} and cost per order, {{are used to}} assess the cost effectiveness and profitability of internet marketing. Pay-per-click has an advantage over cost per impression in that it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> how effective the advertising was. Clicks are a way to measure attention and interest. If the main purpose of an ad is to generate a click, or more specifically drive traffic to a destination, then pay-per-click is the preferred metric. Once a certain number of web impressions are achieved, the quality and placement of the advertisement will affect click through rates and the resulting pay-per-click.|$|R
