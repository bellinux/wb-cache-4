25|$|Media {{are more}} similar than {{different}} – Psychologically speaking, a computer {{is not much}} different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.252). In other words, the media does not make people react <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema {{of the world in}} childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E

25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E

I don't know what it'll take to push us on to that level, but I think we've got it in us." [...] Chilton, however, told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "I'm constantly surprised that people fall for Big Star <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do...</b> People say Big Star made some of the best rock 'n roll albums ever.

Olyphant would return for the season's Halloween special, [...] "Costume Contest", and would appear in a deleted scene for Carell's penultimate episode, [...] "Michael's Last Dundies". Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show, later telling IGN that filming both [...] "The Sting" [...] and his scenes for other episodes was [...] "a blast" [...] and [...] "a kick to do" [...] because The Office is [...] "such a fun show, {{the nature of the}} whole thing. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it is just so fun and easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Before biology, {{there were}} several terms used {{for the study of}} animals and plants. Natural history {{referred}} to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included mineralogy and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Natural philosophy and natural theology encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> though these subjects also included what is now geology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. Botany, zoology, and (in the case of fossils) geology replaced natural history and natural philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries before biology was widely adopted. To this day, [...] "botany" [...] and [...] "zoology" [...] are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.|$|E

However, we need to focus more on strategic markets {{in other parts of the}} world, where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont brand equity for profitable growth". Race organizer Mike Plant explained that [...] "I talked to them a couple of months ago, and they had to make a hard decision. They don't have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising. They put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> business". Plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of the event had grown significantly, but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{was written}} by long-time writer John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The producers decided to create another episode centered on Santa's Little Helper, as they enjoyed the previous ones, particularly season one's [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", in which the Simpson family receives him. Reardon commented {{that one of the}} hardest feats with the episode was to make Santa's Little Helper not express any human expressions, as the staff preferred animals on the show to behave exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in real life. The plot of [...] "Dog of Death" [...] was based on an experience Swartzwelder had with his own dog that also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. The Gold Coast Bulletins Ryan Ellem commented that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a [...] "very real" [...] dilemma that many families [...] "who normally don't budget for a pooch's bung knee" [...] face.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of cops on the job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved as if we were [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [...] not given to drooling, panting".|$|E

2500|$|In other words, whereas McGrew {{argues that}} anthropologists {{must focus on}} {{behaviors}} like communication and tool-use {{because they have no}} access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest stone tools in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, {{the question is not whether}} other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> these things. [...] "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," [...] and other examples of primate tool-use and learning [...] "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal." [...] Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking.
