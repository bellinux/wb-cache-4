25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes {{seems to be one}} of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E
25|$|Two {{newspaper}} articles written by Heinrich Lienhard were published independently of his manuscript. The {{first appeared in}} the Glarner Zeitung after his short stay in Switzerland in 1849. It gives a first-hand account of California, Sutter’s Fort, the discovery of gold, and life in the mines as well as the most advantageous route to California, undoubtedly then of much interest for many readers. The second article appeared in 1885 in the San Francisco Daily Examiner. Lienhard had sent it as {{a letter to the editor}} <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> eventful time of the gold discovery and the beginning of the gold rush.|$|E

Wolverine {{is one of}} the few characters who can remember the House of M world and seeks out to enact vengeance on those who wronged him. In Wolverine: Origins, the character's second solo series, Wolverine discovers that he has a son named Daken, who has been brainwashed and made a living weapon by the villain Romulus, the man behind Wolverine's own brainwashing. Wolverine then makes it his mission to rescue Daken and stop Romulus from manipulating or harming anyone again.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E

After finding a {{business}} card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business. They enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his Buddhist temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> they had been at the White Lion strip club, where they learn that Stu was sodomized by a kathoey stripper named Kimmy. Upon exiting, the trio are attacked by two Russian mobsters who steal the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.|$|E

500|$|Breen {{wrote that}} the radiate crown that the Liberty head bears is not {{dissimilar}} to those on certain Roman coins, but is [...] "more explicitly intended <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> on the Statue of Liberty". Anthony de Francisci recalled that he opened {{the window of the}} studio and let the wind blow on his wife's hair as he worked. However, he did not feel that the design depicted her exclusively. He noted that [...] "the nose, the fullness of the mouth are much like my wife's, although the whole face has been elongated". De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps) {{had already}} busied {{themselves}} with searching the air waves {{for signs of}} a British raid. Before the first RAF bombers had taken off, they had already determined that a raid of at least 500 aircraft would take place that night. The Luftwaffe defences were alerted. Shortly afterwards the code word Gisela was issued to fighter units. Some German units did not treat the message with the urgency required.

After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E
500|$|HitFix {{reviewer}} Alan Sepinwall complemented {{the series}} for its cast and music, {{but said that}} he didn't understand the hype towards the series. He also criticized {{the battle for the}} main-role of Marilyn for the musical, writing, [...] "the show keeps trying to position Karen and Ivy as equally-deserving of the part, when Hilty very thoroughly outclasses McPhee whenever the production numbers start." [...] Despite this, he called the pilot, [...] "smart and slick", and that he would keep on watching future episodes. He ultimately gave the episode a B. In a podcast with Sepinwall and fellow HitFix writer Dan Feinberg, the two were very negative towards Jaime Cepero's performance as Ellis Tancharoen, with Sepinwall comparing it to a failed version of [...] "All About Eve". They also criticized the writing for Messing's character, Julia Houston and Hilty's character, Ivy Lynn. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker praised Messing's performance calling her [...] "funny and charming" [...] and a dialed down version of her Will and Grace character Grace Adler. He later went on to criticize the storyline between McPhee and Hilty, believing that Hilty was [...] "obviously superior" [...] to McPhee and that the storyline felt [...] "strained". He also went on to write that he hoped the series became a ratings success. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, [...] "After we watched the subsequent 14 episodes of Smash with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> the pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of Let Me Be Your Star (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{that time}} until the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union and the end of Communist rule in 1989, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Bulgarian Communist Party and State Security coexisted in a closely symbiotic partnership, in which each supported the other. 11 (out of 15) [...] members of Bulgarian Orthodox Church's Holy Synod worked for communist State Security. The party supported the elevation of the exarchate to the rank of patriarchate in May 1953. The 1970 commemoration served <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> the exarchate (which retained its jurisdictional borders until after World War I) included Macedonia and Thrace in addition to present-day Bulgaria.

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, {{in terms of the}} fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have [...] "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of [...] "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Ottaway v Norman [...] Ch., Brightman J held that a {{floating}} obligation attaches to secret trusts: [...] "A valid trust is created in favour of the secondary donee which is in suspense during the lifetime of the donee, but attaches to the estate of the primary donee {{at the moment of}} the latter's death." [...] Edward Nugee QC sitting as deputy High Court judge in Re Basham [...] 1 WLR applied a comparable test in relation to proprietary estoppel. He held that the belief, for detrimental reliance, need not relate to a clearly identified piece of property. Following Cleaver and Birmingham, if it is established by cogent evidence that the intention was to leave the entire estate, proprietary estoppel will enforce that intention.

2500|$|A true {{space frame}} design uses only {{straight}} tubes, properly triangulated to pass loads either in tension or compression. Following proper engineering practice, {{when he started}} to develop plans for the new chassis design Maddock sketched out various straight-tubed space frame designs. However, when he showed each to Charlie Cooper his response was [...] "Nah, Whiskers, that's not it..." [...] Frustrated, Maddock finally went away and drew a frame in which every tube was bent. To his surprise, rather than dismissing it Cooper's reaction was to snatch the plans out of Maddock's hands and exclaim [...] "That's it..." [...] Although the curved tube design broke several engineering rules Maddock and the Coopers later rationalised their decision. Their arguments were that curved tubes could be located and routed so as to leave adequate space for mechanical components, and as the tubes could be run close under the car's bodywork this could be attached directly to the frame, saving the weight and complexity of a dedicated bodywork frame. Although the idea started as a joke Maddock would later defend the design, even in the teeth of strong criticism from Cooper's star driver Jack Brabham. Brabham would come <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> Maddock was latterly an even more staunch defender of the curved-tube concept than Charles Cooper.|$|E
