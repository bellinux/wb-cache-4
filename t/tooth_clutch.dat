50|$|Gears {{have been}} {{included}} within Lego Technic sets since 1977 {{as a way of}} transferring rotary power, and of gearing-up or down the speed. Gears come in several sizes: 8 tooth, 16 tooth, 24 tooth and 40 tooth spur gears; 12 tooth, 20 tooth and 36 tooth double bevel gears; and 12 tooth and 20 tooth single bevel gears. The double bevel gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 <b>tooth</b> <b>clutch</b> gear, and a 24 tooth friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|E
50|$|Introduction - Of all the {{electromagnetic}} <b>clutches,</b> the <b>tooth</b> <b>clutches</b> provide {{the greatest amount}} of torque in the smallest overall size. Because torque is transmitted without any slippage, clutches are ideal for multi stage machines where timing is critical such as multi-stage printing presses. Sometimes, exact timing needs to be kept, so <b>tooth</b> <b>clutches</b> can be made with a single position option which means that they will only engage at a specific degree mark. They can be used in dry or wet (oil bath) applications, so they are very well suited for gear box type drives.|$|R
50|$|How {{it works}} - Electromagnetic <b>tooth</b> <b>clutches</b> operate via an {{electric}} actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current {{flows through the}} clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. This flux is then transferred through the small gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts the armature teeth to the rotor teeth. In most instances, the rotor is consistently rotating with the input (driver). As soon as the clutch armature and rotor are engaged, lock up is 100%.|$|R

50|$|They {{should not}} be used in high speed {{applications}} or applications that have engagement speeds over 50 rpm otherwise damage to the <b>clutch</b> <b>teeth</b> would occur when trying to engage the clutch.|$|R
40|$|A rotary {{coupling}} for connecting a driven part to {{a source}} of rotary force is described. This device transmits rotary force in one direction only and disengages to permit the driven part to free wheel when the input member is stopped and precludes the backdriving of rotary force from output member to input member. The coupling includes an input member having a splined shaft, a coupling member connected to the splined shaft, and a coaxial output member. The coupling member and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing <b>clutch</b> <b>teeth.</b> Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the coupling member and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the <b>clutch</b> <b>teeth</b> by moving the coupling member toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit free wheeling of output member when input member is stopped...|$|R
50|$|In 1984 import tariffs were changed, {{causing the}} V45 engine to be modified. Honda reduced the {{displacement}} to 698 cc by destroking the motor from 48.6 mm to 45.4 mm, added a <b>tooth</b> on the <b>clutch</b> gear {{to compensate for}} a loss of torque and changed the model name to VF700S. The VF700S models continued for only one more year.|$|R

He has taken my wife and he would take thy betrothed. Let it be! Let it be! Ah, would that I had been there to see the wrestling--Ospakar had never risen from his snow-bed. But there is time left to us, and I shall yet see his head roll along the dust. Thou hast his goodly sword and with it thou shalt sweep Blacktooth's head from his shoulders--or perchance that shall be my lot," [...] and with this Skallagrim sprang up, gnashing his <b>teeth</b> and <b>clutching</b> at the air.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent <b>clutches</b> like <b>tooth</b> or dog <b>clutches</b> which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|R
40|$|The {{shallow water}} {{assemblage}} of chondrichthyan microremains, teeth, tooth plates and scales, {{from the middle}} Tournaisian (Mississippian) of the vicinity of Muhua village, Guizhou province, southern China, is thus far the richest and most diverse association of this age collected from a single locality and horizon, and represents a chondrichthyan community very restricted in time and space. It was recovered from a small bioclastic limestone lens, MH− 1, occurring among basinal marls near {{the base of the}} Muhua Formation, and dated as to the Siphonodella crenulata conodont Zone. The majority of the fauna presented here consists of teeth with euselachian−type bases and crushing crowns belonging to bottom−dwelling durophagous chondrichthyans, most probably feeding on shelly invertebrates such as the abundant brachiopods. We assigned most of these teeth to Euselachii (six species, among them Cassisodus margaritae gen. et sp. nov.), Petalodontiformes (two species), Holocephali (five species), and Euchondrocephali incertae sedis (Cristatodens sigmoidalis gen. et sp. nov.). We also identified primitive polycuspid, <b>clutching</b> <b>teeth</b> representing Phoebodontiformes (Thrinacodus bicuspidatus sp. nov.), Symmoriiformes, and Ctenacanthiformes. The scales are typical growing, com− pound forms of the protacrodont, ctenacanth, and hybodont types. Two problematic denticulated plates were found, one of which resembles mandibular or palatal plates of Sibyrhynchus (Iniopterygii). Several of the identified chondrichthyan taxa have hitherto been known only from Laurussia, especially from the British Isles and central USA. In particular we found the first record of Chondrenchelys sp. and Diclitodus denshumani outside their type locality. Th...|$|R
60|$|I find from my ever-faithful note-book {{that the}} {{landscape}} {{seemed to grow}} drearier as we got away from Madrid, but {{this may have been}} the effect of the waning day: a day which at its brightest had been dim from recurrent rain and incessant damp. The gloom was not relieved by the long stops at the frequent stations, though the stops were good for getting one's breath, and for trying to plan greater control over one's activities when the train should be going on again. The stations themselves were not so alluring that we were not willing to get away from them; and we were glad to get away from them by train, instead of by mule-team over the rainy levels to the towns that glimmered along the horizon two or three miles off. There had been nothing to lift the heart in the sight of two small boys ready perched on one horse, or of a priest difficultly mounting another in his long robe. At the only station which I can remember having any town about it a large number of our passengers left the train, and I realized that they were commuters like those who might have been leaving it at some soaking suburb of Long Island or New Jersey. In the sense of human brotherhood which the fact inspired I was not so lonely as I might have been, when we resumed our gloomy progress, with all that punctilio which custom demands of a Spanish way-train. First the station-master rings a bell of alarming note hanging on the wall, and the mozos run along the train shutting the car doors. After an interval some other official sounds a pocket whistle, and then there is still time for a belated passenger to find his car and scramble aboard. When the ensuing pause prolongs itself until you think the train has decided to remain all day, or all night, and several passengers have left it again, the locomotive rouses itself and utters a peremptory screech. This really means going, but your doubt has not been fully overcome when the wheels begin to bump under your compartment, and you set your <b>teeth</b> and <b>clutch</b> your seat, and otherwise prepare yourself for the renewal of your acrobatic feats. I may not get the order of the signals for departure just right, but I am sure of their number. Perhaps the Sud-Express starts with less, but the Sud-Express is partly French.|$|R
