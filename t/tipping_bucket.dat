25|$|The Alton Towers Waterpark, {{formerly}} known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003. It is a large, part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a lazy river, a giant <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike Chessington Zoo at the also Merlin operated Chessington World of Adventures Resort, a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.|$|E
25|$|Other rides include Rush & Rampage, twin racing slides where riders {{experience}} wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. Lazy River (Calypso Creek) is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water {{jets and}} tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. The <b>Tipping</b> <b>Bucket</b> is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. Flash Floods are tiered outdoor pools with two slides {{leading to the}} middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include Volcanic Springs, and indoor heated hot pool, and Bubbly Wubbly Pool, an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.|$|E
500|$|Three family-oriented attractions {{are located}} on the ground level, {{detached}} from the three slide towers. Two of these are children's areas {{and the third is}} a wave pool. Pipeline Plunge is a children's area with four flume slides and hundreds of water activities. The area, originally called Nickelodeon's Pipeline Plunge, is a large, multi-level water play structure featuring an [...] <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> which dumps water on guests every few minutes. It played host to two [...] "Slime Fest" [...] events in 2009 that included several live shows, a dunking chair and [...] "Australia's biggest sliming" [...] where [...] of slime was dumped on park guests using green coloured water in the giant <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> twice daily. The mass sliming returned in the 2010/2011 summer holidays as part of the Summer Funomenon. Pipeline Plunge is a WhiteWater West Aqua Play area. Wiggle Bay is a Wiggles themed toddler area featuring musical and interactive water play activities, a shallow pool and four Wiggles-coloured water slides, located {{at the back of the}} area. these were manufactured by ProSlide. The interactive features are manufactured by WaterPlay. The Cave of Waves is a themed [...] wave pool which can generate waves of up to [...] high. Built by Murphy's Waves of Scotland, the pool has a constant temperature of 26 degrees Celsius. The Get Wet Surf School makes use of the pool for its lessons outside of normal park operating hours.|$|E

500|$|The {{standard}} way {{of measuring}} rainfall or snowfall {{is the standard}} rain gauge, {{which can be found}} in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by [...] of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to [...] resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate [...] markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year into}} Wren's {{appointment}} as a Savilian Professor in Oxford, the Royal Society was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied mechanics thoroughly, especially elastic collisions and pendulum motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence {{to the study}} of meteorology: in 1662 he invented the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> rain gauge and, in 1663, designed a [...] "weather-clock" [...] that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.|$|E
2500|$|In 1441, King Sejong's son, Prince Munjong, {{invented the}} first {{standardized}} rain gauge. These were sent throughout the Joseon Dynasty of Korea {{as an official}} tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer's potential harvest. In 1450, Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging-plate anemometer, and {{was known as the}} first anemometer. In 1607, Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: [...] "Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow)". In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer. In 1662, Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical, self-emptying, <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> rain gauge. In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type thermometer. In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the [...] "centigrade" [...] temperature scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In 1802–1803, Luke Howard wrote On the Modification of Clouds, in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. In 1806, Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds. Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published, including the International Cloud Atlas, which has remained in print ever since. The April 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, {{marked the beginning of the}} age where weather information became available globally.|$|E

50|$|Other {{types of}} gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the {{cheapest}} rain gauge and most fragile), the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. The wedge and <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> gauges will {{have problems with}} snow. Attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing. Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if {{left out in the}} open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with.

40|$|A {{verification}} {{study of}} the Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) storm total precipitation (STP) estimates was performed. The analyzed STP estimates from LAPS were compared to cooperative observer and Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) precipitation reports throughout the county warning area of the National Weather Service (NWS) office located in Chanhassen, Minnesota (MPX). ASOS heated <b>tipping</b> <b>buckets</b> and standard eight-inch rain gauges were the instruments used for the precipitation measurements. This study includes 12 cold-season precipitation cases that were collected from December 2002 to March 2003.

The results of the statistical analysis showed that the LAPS STP radar algorithms generally overestimate in the 0 to 31 nautical mile (nm) range from the radar. A general underestimation by the LAPS STP in the 85 to 115 nm range from the radar was also found. The most reliable LAPS STP data lied between 32 and 84 nm from the radar. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{water budget}} of soil, the uptake in {{plants and the}} {{leaching}} to groundwater of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were simulated simultaneously using a physiological plant uptake model and a <b>tipping</b> <b>buckets</b> water and solute transport model for soil. Simulations were compared to results from a ten-year experimental field study, where four organic amendments were applied every second year. Predicted concentrations slightly decreased (Cd) or stagnated (Pb) in control soils, but increased in amended soils by about 10 % (Cd) and 6 % to 18 % (Pb). Estimated plant uptake was lower in amended plots, due to an increase of K(d) (dry soil to water partition coefficient). Predicted concentrations in plants were close to measured levels in plant residues (straw), but higher than measured concentrations in grains. Initially, Pb was mainly predicted to deposit from air into plants (82 % in 1998); the next years, uptake from soil became dominating (30 % from air in 2006), because of decreasing levels in air. For Cd, predicted uptake from air into plants was negligible (1 - 5 %) ...|$|R
