25|$|Peace was remanded for a week, {{in which}} he refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> But in captivity, {{he wrote a letter}} to a {{business}} colleague who decided to co-operate with police, and revealed its author as Peace, writing under his pseudonym John Ward. Under that name, he was tried at the Old Bailey for burglary and the attempted murder of PC Robinson. The evidence against the prisoner was clear enough, and he was sentenced by Mr. Justice Hawkins to penal servitude for life.|$|E
25|$|In August 1899 the 6th Battalion, Rifles of the Canadian Non-Permanent Active Militia, {{located in}} Vancouver, British Columbia, asked Prince Arthur <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to the {{regiment}} {{and act as}} its honorary colonel. The regiment had recently been converted to the infantry role from the 2nd Battalion, 5th British Columbia Regiment of Canadian Artillery. With the Prince's agreement the unit was renamed 6th Regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles (DCORs) on 1 May 1900. He was subsequently appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment, then known as The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), in 1923. He held that appointment until his death.|$|E
500|$|Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{published}} anonymously with the credit granted to [...] "a Bostonian". His name, typically listed as [...] "Edgar A. Poe", was not published {{with his work}} until his second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in late 1829. Poe may have chosen not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> so that his foster father, John Allan, would not know where he was; moreover, his choice to embrace his Bostonian heritage {{may have been an}} attempt to distance himself from the Allan family in Richmond. Boston was, at the time, a center for publishing and the literary world. By the time the book was released, Poe was already in the Army.|$|E

500|$|With Elizabeth's accession, {{it seemed}} {{probable}} that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, {{in line with}} the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, [...] "I am the only man in the country not allowed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to his own children." [...] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} of Elizabeth to {{the throne}} brought up {{the question of the}} name of the royal house. The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this. Prince Philip privately complained, [...] "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to his own children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frank Tyson: [...] Australian {{newspapers}} {{had accused}} Tyson of dragging in the 1954-55 tour and an English newspaper responded; [...] "Will Tyson be [...] "sacrificed" [...] {{to avoid any}} risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?" [...] with pictures of his bowling action. In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption read [...] "Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!". An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to an article declaring [...] "Replay Tests - Tyson Not Fair".

2500|$|In League, University and Army cricket Tyson {{had used}} a 'short' run up of 18 or 20 yards {{consisting}} of ten short steps and ten long final strides to the wicket. When he moved to first class cricket this increased to 38 yards, starting near the sightscreen and over 200 feet from the wicket-keeper, who was often reduced to an athletic long stop. With a final leap to the wicket he released the ball with a high arm action and a heave of his shoulders, 'the ferocity of his delivery' was described as 'every muscle is in use, the right foot takes the strain, the right arm is straight ready for delivery and the left leg kicks out menacingly'. Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging his right foot over the popping crease on the 1954–55 tour and an English newspaper responded; [...] "Will Tyson be [...] "sacrificed" [...] to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?" [...] with pictures of his bowling action. In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption reading [...] "Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!" [...] An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to an article declaring [...] "Replay Tests – Tyson Not Fair". Unlike the great swing [...] bowler Fred Trueman he 'bowled straight and...never intentionally bowled an out-swinger. Instead Tyson relied on his tremendous pace to take most of his wickets, batsmen were often caught in mid-stroke by {{the speed of the}} ball coming onto the bat, or were too nervous to play fluently. On a green or crumbling wicket providing movement he could simply blast his way through the batting, and produced bounce and pace even off the placid Northamptonshire wickets. Tyson believed that a bouncer should 'pin the batsman against the sightscreen' and frequently used them to intimidate batsmen, even tailenders His ungainly action and quest for raw speed took a toll on even his strong body and he suffered from a series of injuries which brought a premature end to his career. In 1994 he had operations to his right arm and knees and a further operation on his knees in 2001 rendered him practically immobile for a short time. As he put it himself [...] "to bowl fast is to revel in the glad animal action, to thrill in physical power and to enjoy a sneaking feeling of superiority over the mortals who play the game". However, he was no simple bowler, but thought hard how to dismiss and deceive batsman. John Arlott wrote [...] "This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling" [...] and [...] "He is intelligent beyond the usual run of fast bowlers: he is the type of cricketer whom improves rapidly through thinking about the game".|$|E
