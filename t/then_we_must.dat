5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

25|$|When {{turning a}} cube over is {{considered}} to be a change in permutation <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1×1024).|$|E

25|$|Another common {{argument}} against dualism consists {{in the idea}} that since human beings (both phylogenetically and ontogenetically) begin their existence as entirely physical or material entities and since nothing outside of {{the domain of the}} physical is added later on in the course of development, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> necessarily end up being fully developed material beings. There is nothing non-material or mentalistic involved in conception, the formation of the blastula, the gastrula, and so on. The postulation of a non-physical mind would seem superfluous.|$|E
25|$|If so, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> plan our eugenic policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods {{must be taught}} them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|E
25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E

Marshall admitted that the Constitution does not enumerate a power to create a central Bank but {{said that this is}} not dispositive as to Congress's power to establish such an institution. Chief Justice Marshall wrote, [...] "In considering this question, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{arguing for}} an object-based methodology, Peter Wegner [...] {{suggested}} that [...] "positivist scientific philosophies, such as operationalism in physics and behaviorism in psychology" [...] were powerfully {{applied in the}} early part of the 20th century. However, computation has changed the landscape. He notes that we need to distinguish four levels of [...] "irreversible physical and computational abstraction" [...] (Platonic abstraction, computational approximation, functional abstraction, and value computation). <b>Then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> rely on interactive methods, that have behavior as their focus (see duck test).|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Aquinas, an {{influential}} Catholic philosopher, presented five ways, or arguments for God's existence, in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles {{was a major}} apologetic work. Blaise Pascal outlined an approach to apologetics in his Pensées: [...] "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the density is {{positive}} definite and convected according to this continuity equation implies that we may integrate the density over a certain domain and set the total to 1, and this condition will be maintained by the conservation law.

Now, if we wish to maintain {{the notion of a}} convected density, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> generalize the Schrödinger expression of the density and current so that space and time derivatives again enter symmetrically in relation to the scalar wave function.

Hitler spoke for the first hour, then Faulhaber {{told him that the}} Nazi government had been waging war on the church for three years - 600 religious teachers had lost their jobs in Bavaria alone - and the number was set to rise to 1700 and the government had instituted laws the Church could not accept - like the sterilization of criminals and the handicapped.

2500|$|To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan {{point out}} that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also {{maintains}} that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among {{a wide range of}} blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian stewardship. John Piper's Desiring God ministry further explains,Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it.
