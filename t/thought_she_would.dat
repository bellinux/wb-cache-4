5|$|As he grew older, he {{retained}} his famed elasticity but show signed of age {{in other}} areas, especially at the walk, which was his weakest skill in the dressage ring. Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games. To celebrate his retirement, there was a ceremony in Van Grunsven's home town and a farewell ride at an international jumping competition in Maastricht, Netherlands. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find another horse {{as good as he}} was; however, his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rule the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the trauma of the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
5|$|Cold Feet {{began its}} first {{series with the}} six main cast members—James Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst—who had {{appeared}} in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in The Perfect Match made a positive impression on Christine Langan. Norris originally auditioned for the part of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class. Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney, and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to The Troubles. Baxendale was best known for her role in Cardiac Arrest and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy. Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in Joking Apart. Ripley <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be auditioning for the part of Rachel, and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny. When the fourth series was commissioned, Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options. Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, a replacement character who remained on screen until Cold Feets conclusion. Bullen makes numerous Hitchcock-esque cameo appearances; he plays a neighbour and a husband in the first series and a workman in the third.|$|E

He had not really <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go with him; perhaps he had hardly wished it, for on such an expedition a woman would necessarily add to the difficulty and danger; but he had <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have {{told him that his}} love was returned, and for perhaps {{the first time in his}} life he was serious in his protestation of it.|$|R

25|$|Before writing novels, Waters {{worked as}} an academic, earning a {{doctorate}} and teaching. Waters went directly from her doctoral thesis to her first novel. It was {{during the process of}} writing her thesis that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> write a novel; she began as soon as the thesis was complete. Her work is very research-intensive, which is an aspect she enjoys. Waters was briefly a member of the long-running London North Writers circle, whose members have included the novelists Charles Palliser and Neil Blackmore, among others.|$|E
25|$|Kendall awakes {{from her}} coma {{days after her}} transplant. She is told of having been {{recently}} comatose, about her heart transplant, that Josh is dead and she has his heart, and of Bianca's engagement to Reese. Kendall is naturally overwhelmed by all the news, but handles it well. When she is told of Zach having fathered Bianca's second child, she seems numb to this news also. Her family had <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take this particular news badly, but Kendall seems okay with it. Greenlee (Kendall's best friend) and Erica, however, {{are the only ones}} to believe that Kendall is not okay with Zach being the father.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Belmonte and her {{siblings}} took their elementary studies at Kamuning Public School and Hope Christian High School, and {{their high school}} studies at the Philippine Christian Colleges and UP High School. She was often teased at school for having a boy's name, so her father started calling her Betty. When she was 19, she {{wanted to become a}} Protestant missionary and stay single. This upset her grandmother, who wanted her to marry. In college, {{she wanted to be a}} painter and pursue a course in Fine Arts but her father <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be able to make a living as a painter and enrolled her in an English degree at the University of the Philippines Diliman instead.|$|E

25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be safe. He {{told her he was}} no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

500|$|One award Sheindlin had {{difficulty}} winning was a Daytime Emmy Award. By 2011, her program had been nominated 14 consecutive years without winning. In mid-2012, an article from the New York Post reported that Judge Judy was snubbed by the award show by not even being nominated that year despite being the highest-rated court show. In {{an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin said, [...] "I have my walls full of Daytime Emmy Award nominations."

[...] Caroline Sullivan for The Guardian described the song as [...] "mood elevating with an abrasive grime beat." [...] Matthew Horton for Virgin Media described the song as [...] "unexpectedly ravey". Chris Smith for Yahoo! described the song as a curveball and wrote that he felt it is Lewis' [...] "first truly club friendly track". Sam Lanksy for Idolator thought that although the song is radio-friendly, it is not [...] "derivative".|$|E
500|$|Pickering {{assigned}} Leavitt {{to study}} [...] "variable stars," [...] whose luminosity varies over time. According to science writer Jeremy Bernstein, [...] "variable stars had been {{of interest for}} years, but when she was studying those plates, I doubt Pickering <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make a significant discoverymdash&one that would eventually change astronomy." [...] Leavitt noted thousands of variable stars in images of the Magellanic Clouds. In 1908 she published her results in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College, noting that {{a few of the}} variables showed a pattern: brighter ones appeared to have longer periods. After further study, she confirmed in 1912 that the Cepheid variables with greater intrinsic luminosity did have longer periods, and that the relationship was quite close and predictable.|$|E

500|$|Construction progressed in {{fits and}} starts, plagued {{by a number of}} short delays in the {{delivery}} of iron and occasional shortages of cash, but they did not significantly delay the ship's progress by more than a few weeks. The hundred days allotted for her construction passed on 12 January, but the Navy chose not to penalize the consortium. The name [...] "Monitor", meaning [...] "one who admonishes and corrects wrongdoers", was proposed by Ericsson on 20 January 1862 and approved by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox. [...] While Ericsson stood on its deck in defiance of all his critics who <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never float, Monitor was launched on 30 January 1862 to the cheers of the watching crowd, even those who had bet that the ship would sink straight to the bottom, and commissioned on 25 February.|$|E

She said of her departure: [...] "The musicians at PYP have become my kids. When I look back, these five years will always be the most memorable time of my musical career."
