2500|$|In October 1748, family {{connections}} (Benjamin Waller {{was related}} to Zachary Lewis) probably helped Wythe secure his first government job, as clerk to two powerful committees of the House of Burgesses, Privileges and Elections and Propositions and Grievances. Wythe also continued to practice law before those committees and the General Court in Williamsburg, as was permitted at the time. In 1750, Wythe was first elected as one of Williamsburg's aldermen. [...] Wythe also briefly served as the king's attorney general in 1754–1755, appointed by lieutenant governor Robert Dinwiddie while Peyton Randolph traveled to London on the burgesses' behalf to appeal Dinwiddie's charging a one pistole fee <b>to</b> <b>affix</b> <b>an</b> official <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> land patents. Wythe resigned when Randolph returned from his unsuccessful mission. Lieutenant governor Robert Dinwiddie returned to England {{less than three years}} after Peyton Randolph's return.|$|R

50|$|Public Works Canada, however, {{refused to}} allow the city <b>to</b> <b>affix</b> <b>an</b> informational plaque <b>to</b> the building, since it was still owned by the federal {{government}}. In 2010, the government decided to surplus the building, and a private concern, 6133 NWT Ltd., a partnership between Denendeh Investments and JV Development, took over ownership.

Most modern bicycles have threaded holes in the frame to hold the bottle cage, often called braze-ons even though they may be welded, glued, riveted, or moulded into the frame material. Clamps are necessary on bicycles not so equipped, such as older or less expensive models.|$|R
