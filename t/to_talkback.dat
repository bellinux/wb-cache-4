40|$|This article explores {{talkback}} radio programmes' {{creation of}} community during disasters. It examines how community is {{formed by the}} contributions audience members make <b>to</b> <b>talkback</b> radio during natural disasters, thus probing beyond the instrumental value of providing information on air as a disaster is unfolding. Normative theories of crisis communication situate authorities as the regulators of information provision through controlled media channels to the public when disasters occur. This article suggests that talkback radio programmes present a challenge to normative models of communication and governance during disasters. The public use talkback programmes to distribute information directly to audiences with whom they identify, not only augmenting but also actively subverting the control authorities have over public communication. Such bottom-up coordinative activity is similar but not identical to the recent uses of social media in popular uprisings as talkback radio still provides a measure of access control and editing.

40|$|Debates about user-generated content (UGC) often {{depend on}} a {{contrast}} with its normative opposite, the professionally produced content that is supported and sustained by commercial media businesses or public organisations. UGC is seen to appear within or in opposition to professional media, often as a disruptive, creative, change-making force. Our suggestion is to position UGC not in opposition to professional or "producer media", or in hybridised forms of subjective combination with it (the so-called "pro-sumer" or "pro-am" system), but in relation to different criteria, namely the formal and informal elements in media industries. In this article, we set out a framework for the comparative and historical analysis of UGC systems and their relations with other formal and informal media activity, illustrated with examples ranging from games <b>to</b> <b>talkback</b> radio. We also consider the policy implications that emerge from a historicised reading of UGC as a recurring dynamic within media industries, rather than a manifestation of consumer agency specific to digital cultures...|$|E

40|$|Designing documents, such as {{writing a}} {{technical}} paper, manual or WWW home pages, {{starts with a}} goal in mind but often does not simply proceed in a top-down problem solving style.

Our research aims at supporting this collage or trial-and-error style of writing as design, drawing on the concepts of re ec-tion in action and hermeneutics.

40|$|John Laws famously {{labelled}} his commercial radio talkback program, and its genre, 'dial-in democracy'. Amongst the mellifluous {{tones of}} Laws and 'Andrea', the gravelly rasps of Brian White and Derryn Hinch, and the impatient injunctions of Alan Jones and Howard Sattler {{have been the}} voices of countless 'ordinary' Australians. Here, I consider how voices of 'the people' have been heard in Australian print media outlets, led by The Bulletin, since the nineteenth century, and on Australian radio since the 1920 s. The discussion moves from community singing to radio clubs, programs like Voice of the People to Australia's Amateur Hour, and of course <b>to</b> <b>talkback.</b> Along the way, it reflects {{on issues such as}} the flow of ideas and influences between Britain, the United States and Australia; the ways in which notions of the public and the community have been deployed by commercial radio managements and interpreted by broadcasting regulators; and how listeners and callers - like some regular writers of letters to the editor - can emerge as media identities in their own right. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{has had an}} {{important}} influence on the constitution and participation of the commercial metropolitan talkback radio audience. The introduction of talkback in the 1960 s was hindered by technical impediments {{to the quality of}} telephone and radio recording technologies, and the level of domestic telephone penetration meant access <b>to</b> <b>talkback</b> was not fully realised until the mid to late 1970 s. By the 1990 s, the advent of mobile telephony liberated talkback listeners from their anchoring in the domestic sphere. Programmers reported that while most telephone calls in the 1970 s and 1980 s originated from housewives, the unemployed and retirees, mobile phones attracted a greater number of men, younger listeners and workers. This article examines the way successive media technologies have influenced experience of talkback radio audiences from the 1960 s through to the present. Invoking recent themes in media theory that acknowledge the increasing convergence between traditional media platforms and content, it considers whether newer technologies such as the internet are fundamentally altering the shape and function of this form of listener participation. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Talkback {{radio in}} Australia has been {{identified}} as a space used by politicians to communicate with the public. The political power wielded by talkback radio programs and hosts has also been explored (Griffen-Foley, 2007; Faine, 2005; Ward, 2002). However, relatively little is known about how Australian audiences who listen <b>to</b> <b>talkback</b> radio receive and react to the political content and, more importantly, how these audiences use talkback to engage with politicians. This article explores these issues, with a focus on the latter theme, through the words of {{some of the people who}} listen to and call talkback radio programs in Australia. It examines the role played by talkback radio for these audiences in facilitating access to politicians and how some individuals use this access to achieve solutions to their problems and issues. To some extent, its findings counter existing research, which has positioned talkback radio as the tool of the politician, revealing that in some instances it can be a powerful tool for the citizen.
