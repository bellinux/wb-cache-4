500|$|The Simpsons was {{the first}} {{successful}} animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> on other animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, [...] "The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation {{that had not been}} there for many, many years... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium." ...|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that it was a bold choice for a single Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] was a brave choice for a single, called it [...] "angry and lyrically incendiary", and noted that Swizz Beatz's beats are [...] "unusually intricate". Norman Meyers of Prefix Magazine noted that the song is evidence of Knowles' willingness <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances.</b> Calling [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] a [...] "bunny-boiling bonanza" [...] and a [...] "killer club track", Rach Read of TeenToday wrote that it is a definite highlight and that [...] "it's great to see an artist at the top of her game prepared to take risks with a track as unhinged as this." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post defined Knowles' character in the song as a [...] "jealousy-crazed ex", and expressed his disappointment that it could not manage a [...] "more convincing refrain". Andy Kellman of Allmusic called it [...] "an angered, atonal, and out-of-character song". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the siren-assisted caterwaul of second single 'Ring the Alarm' sounds genuinely (and marvelously) incoherent." [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald described [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as a [...] "posturing and eventually annoying" [...] track.|$|E
500|$|As major Hollywood {{studios and}} audiences both become savvy to cult films, {{productions}} once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films. [...] Remarking {{on the popular}} trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of New York magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia. [...] Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films {{now that they have}} finally become successful and mainstream, are too slick to attract a proper cult following, lack context, or are too easily found online. [...] In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films. [...] Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters. [...] Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences. [...] This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film. [...] Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror, academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings. [...] Koven also identifies television shows, such as Twin Peaks, as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture. David Lynch himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> on non-mainstream ideas. [...] Despite this, the Alamo Drafthouse has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from Rocky Horror and retro promotional gimmickry. [...] They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own.|$|E

2500|$|This new [...] "Generation Six" [...] racecar debuted at the 2013 Daytona 500 and its {{supporting}} races. [...] The {{testing and}} design of the car began in May 2010 and involved an unusual level of cooperation between the manufacturers (Chevrolet, Ford, and Toyota) involved. [...] The 500 and subsequent race at Phoenix International Raceway, however, caused controversy, as passing was limited and drivers such as Brad Keselowski and Denny Hamlin were critical of the car's ability to pass; the controversy was exacerbated when NASCAR fined Hamlin $25,000 over his comments. [...] The view was also expressed that the car's slow development time and lack of available parts made drivers reluctant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances,</b> with improvement expected with more time invested into the car.|$|E
2500|$|A {{string of}} Birmingham errors helped Cardiff City to {{third place in}} the table.

Riis organized his autobiography chronologically, but each chapter illustrates a broader theme that America is a land of opportunity {{for those who are}} bold enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> on their future.

It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now".

2500|$|... 1988, {{the last}} ever Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh {{race of the}} season from McLaren {{teammate}} and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 {{was hit by a}} deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, {{who did not want to}} start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after a lot of political ramifications, he was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was in an awful mental state, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini's slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. But even with such a huge lead which extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> that most other drivers would not. But going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna came up behind Briton Martin Brundle's Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not let up and then he hit the back of Brundle's car and it tore off his front left wheel and suspension, so the Brazilian had to retire; effectively handing Prost his third Drivers' Championship; McLaren's appeal had not been decided yet; and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, the race was called after it reached the two-hour time limit.|$|E
