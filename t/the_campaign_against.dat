5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of defiance, in the context of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> female genital {{mutilation}} in colonial Kenya.

She also supported Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in British Somaliland in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> Mohammed Abdullah Hassan in 1920. Later that year, the ship was placed in reserve. Ark Royal was recommissioned to ferry an RAF squadron to the Dardanelles during the Chanak Crisis in 1922.

5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of {{the leaders}} of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E

Ranked corporal, Lukis sailed from Fremantle aboard A47Mashobra on 17February 1915, seeing combat first at Gallipoli and then in Egypt. At Gallipoli, the 10thLight Horse went into action in the Battles of the Nek and Hill 60, before being withdrawn in December and redeployed to Egypt.

5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{pressure}} from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay {{the release of the}} captives until after <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI's astrological abilities.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} {{after the death of}} Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was able to return to Palestine. Ibn Killis had {{remained}} implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom he regarded a dangerous individual: even on his deathbed, the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon. In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E

Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle's green. The Royalist cause was now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to send some valuables, including the oak panelling from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for safe-keeping. Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.|$|E

In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'— a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage— as Judge Vaughn Walker.|$|E
