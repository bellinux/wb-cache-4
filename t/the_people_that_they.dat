5|$|The Aztec high priest, Tezozomoc, tells <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{will not}} have the favour of their gods unless they kill the foreigners. Two warriors {{volunteer}} to capture a child to please their gods, and they return with Madoc and the child Hoel. Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time the Aztec warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills the Aztec king, Coanocotzin.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, {{the marchers}} reached Tiruthuraipoondi and {{had planned to}} stay at a choultry which was managed by Ramachandra Naidu, a close {{associate}} of Pillai. Despite the collector's warning, Naidu provided accommodation to the marchers at his choultry. His actions led to him being arrested by the police the following day. The arrest of Iyer and Naidu created fear among the people. Pillai, however, convinced <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could provide food without getting caught by the police. As a result, food packets were found tied to the branches of roadside trees, and when the group rested {{on the banks of}} Kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried. The British policemen, who were deployed to suppress the marchers, suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water. The Indian staff who were employed by the British stopped performing their daily activities, while barbers and washermen refused to serve the government employees.|$|E

25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are now, but this was seen as {{threatening}} to the gods, so Zeus to cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, {{in order to become}} whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend {{to sit back and}} let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was {{concerned}} with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could switch their allegiance to him without breaking the oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, and went through the effort to explain in detail how this could be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah.|$|E

500|$|While out fishing, Homer is {{abducted}} {{by the two}} aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure {{that one of them}} will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> still have to choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The midrash {{begins with}} the death of Miriam, sister of Moses, upon which {{occurrence}} expired the well that the Israelites through Miriam's merit had grown accustomed to rely on for water. [...] Moses and Aaron mourn their sister's death, but the people grow impatient with Moses (significantly, not with Aharon) for his extended crying, and complain to him [...] of the lack of water.

This is seen in [...] "Visa Para un Sueño" [...] about the broken dream of a visit to America. [...] "El Niágara en Bicicleta" [...] — a title based on the Cuban idiom, [...] "al pasar el Niagara en bicicleta", meaning a difficult task — describes the negligence that destroys the social health services.

[...] The other three outlaws, having attended to the horses, joined their chief, and the four imprisoned the men at the station in a spare building used as a store. No interference was offered to the women. Ned assured the male captives time after time that they had nothing whatsoever to fear. Late in the afternoon the manager of the station, Mr. McCauley, returned and was promptly held up. He told Ned Kelly that it was not much use coming to that station, because their own horses were better than any he had. Kelly, however, told him {{that he did not want}} horses, only food for themselves and for their cattle.|$|E

2500|$|In 1567, the {{campaign}} to destroy temples in Bardez met with success, with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed by the Portuguese army. [...] "The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties {{the use of their}} own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshiped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers", wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak Portuguese, on pain of severe penalties. All non-Christian cultural symbols and books written in local languages were also ordered to be destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aim of the}} adversaries, however, was not {{primarily}} to extend their influence over Macedonia but merely to prevent Macedonia succumbing {{to the influence of}} the other. This often violent attempt to persuade <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> belonged to one ethnic group or another pushed some people to reject both. The severe pressure on the peaceful peasants of Macedonia worked against the plans of the Serbians and Bulgarians to make them adopt their ethnic idea and eventually a social divide became apparent. The British Ambassador in Belgrade in 1927 said: [...] "At present the unfortunate Macedonian peasant is between the hammer and the anvil. One day 'comitadjis' come to his house and demand under threat lodging, food and money and the next day the gendarm hales him off to prison for having given them; the Macedonian is really a peaceable, fairly industrious agriculturist and if the (Serbian) government give him adequate protection, education, freedom from malaria and decent communications, there seems no reason why he should not become just as Serbian in sentiment as he was Bulgarian 10 years ago". As a result of this game of tug-of-war, the development of a distinct Macedonian national identity was impeded and delayed. Moreover, when the imperialistic plans of the surrounding states made possible the division of Macedonia, some Macedonian intellectuals such as Misirkov mentioned the necessity of creating a Macedonian national identity which would distinguish the Macedonian Slavs from Bulgarians, Serbians or Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Kattina {{said that}} {{whenever}} the Israelites {{came up to}} the Temple on a Festival, the priests would pull back the curtain and show them the Cherubim, whose bodies were intertwined with one another (in an embrace). And the priests would tell <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were as beloved by God as the love {{between a man and a}} woman. Rav Aha bar Jacob explained that the Second Temple contained painted Cherubim, as [...] says: [...] "And he (Solomon) carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of Cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without," [...] and [...] says, [...] "he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work." [...] And [...] says: [...] "According to the space of each, with loyot ( [...] , ‘wreaths round about')." [...] Rabbah son of Rav Shilah said that [...] "according to the space of each with loyot" [...] means [...] "even as a man embracing his companion." [...] ("Loyot" [...] is connected with the root signifying [...] "attach.") Resh Lakish taught that when the Romans entered the Temple (during its destruction) and saw the Cherubim whose bodies were intertwined with one another, they carried them out and mocked the Israelites, saying that a people whose blessings and curses God supposedly fulfilled occupied themselves with such (sensuous) things. And immediately the Romans debased them, as [...] says: [...] "All that honored her, despised her, because they have seen her nakedness." ...|$|E
