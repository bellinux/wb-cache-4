50|$|April 1987, Signed distributorship {{agreement}} with Rank Cintel Limited (Cintel International now - UK) to sell Cintel <b>telecine</b> <b>equipment</b> in Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{35mm film}} systems, {{whether they are}} cameras, <b>telecine</b> <b>equipment,</b> optical {{printers}} or projectors, are configured to accommodate the 4-perf system, where each frame of 35mm is 4 perforations long. 4-perf was (and remains) the traditional system, and virtually all projectors are based on 4-perf, because 4 perforations is the amount needed per frame vertically {{in order to have}} enough negative space for a roughly squarish image, which became the silent film standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1.|$|E
50|$|The term {{may also}} {{refer to a}} form of copying of movies (normally without {{authorization}} from the copyright holder) created using a telecine machine, as opposed to recording the projected image with a video camera (the camera method with a direct audio source is called a telesync). Since this process requires both access to a print of the movie on film and expensive <b>equipment,</b> <b>telecine</b> bootlegs are less common than camera bootlegs.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} of the television programmes was decentralised, with three Base Production Centres located at Delhi, Cuttack and Hyderabad, and an ISRO studio located in Mumbai. Each of the centres had a production studio, three IVC tape recorders, two 16mm. projectors, a slide Projector in <b>Telecine</b> and audio <b>equipment</b> like tape desks and turntables. Each centre also had 2â€“3 full-fledged synchronised sound camera units, an editing table (Delhi had two) and a film processing plant. There was also a sound dubbing studio equipped with a pilot tone recording plant and an audio mixing console.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, Western Electric {{had settled}} on 24 {{frames per second}} (90 feet per minute) as the {{standard}} film speed for both the sound-on-disc and optical sound systems it was developing. Western Electric's ERPI division dominated the theater hardware market when the sound revolution finally got underway, so its new standard speed was universally adopted by Fox {{and all the other}} studios as each began making sound films. (See the Fleischer cartoon Finding His Voice (1929), credited to Mr. W. E. Erpi.) As a consequence, Case's tests and DeForest's early Phonofilms, shot at about 21 frames per second, gave speakers and singers laughably high-pitched [...] "helium voices" [...] if they were run on a standard sound projector. The Library of Congress and other film archives have printed new copies of some early Phonofilms, modifying them by periodically duplicating frames and correspondingly [...] "stretching" [...] the soundtracks to make them compatible with standard projectors and <b>telecine</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
