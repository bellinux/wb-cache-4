5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his seventh}} pole {{position of the}} season with a time of 1:36.303. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Räikkönen, who qualified 0.342seconds behind Hamilton's time. Massa took third place, needing a good result to retain the possibility of a Championship victory. Alonso qualified in fourth ahead of Kovalainen, who took fifth after struggling for <b>tyre</b> <b>grip</b> during the final session. Webber was sixth fastest in the final session, but was demoted to 16th on the grid {{as a result of his}} penalty. Heidfeld originally qualified sixth, but was penalised three positions for impeding Red Bull driver David Coulthard in the first session. As a result, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel inherited sixth position, ahead of Trulli and Bourdais. Piquet took tenth position. Kubica's eleventh placing was his worst qualifying result to that point in the season, struggling with his car's set-up throughout his two sessions. Rubens Barrichello of Honda took 13th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, to reach the top 15 for the first time in ten races. Williams driver Nico Rosberg took 14th on the grid. Coulthard failed to move beyond the first session; the Red Bull driver qualified in 15th and blamed Heidfeld for his poor performance. Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Jenson Button of Honda and the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would line up on the back two rows of the grid.|$|E
25|$|With the {{diffuser}} change, the {{new rules}} {{in place for the}} 2009 season required cars to have narrower and higher rear wings and wider and lower front wings, designed to reduce air disturbance for following cars and hence make overtaking easier. Slick tyres were also re-introduced in the 2009 Formula One season, having been absent since , this said to increase <b>tyre</b> <b>grip</b> by about 20%.|$|E
25|$|Pérez got {{ahead of}} Räikkönen driving into the tenth turn {{and took over}} seventh when Bottas lost all <b>tyre</b> <b>grip</b> and the latter was demoted out of the points in quick succession. Because {{of the length of}} time spent behind the safety car, the race would end under a two-hour time limit. Unhindered in the final eight laps, Hamilton opened up a healthy {{advantage}} over Vettel and crossed the start/finish line after 60 laps to win the race. Vettel finished second in his best result of the season, 13.534 seconds behind, and successfully held off teammate Ricciardo and Alonso in the race's closing period. Massa finished fifth. Vergne's five-second time penalty did not affect his final finishing position of sixth, and was ahead of Pérez, Räikkönen and Hülkenberg. Magnussen rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Bottas, Maldonado, Grosjean, Kvyat and Ericsson filled the next five places with Marussia teammates Bianchi and Chilton the last of the classified finishers. It was Hamilton's seventh victory of the season, his second in Singapore, and the 29th of his career. There were four lead changes in the race; three drivers reached the front of the field. Hamilton led three times for a total of 58 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E

25|$|Massa {{made his}} pit stop from third on lap 24, and emerged in fifth. Hamilton {{received}} instructions for an engine mode change and Rosberg entered the pit lane from {{the lead on}} the next lap and handed the lead to Hamilton. Bottas made his stop on the same lap and rejoined alongside Vettel on the start/finish straight but was forced wide, allowing Magnussen to pass him. Hamilton took his pit stop on the 26th lap and handed back first place to teammate Rosberg. Bottas also fell behind Pérez but re-passed the latter going into the Rettifilo chicane. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington told him over the radio to remain at least {{two and a half}} seconds behind teammate Rosberg to gain the slipstream advantage without losing downforce and conserve tyre life for an attack in the race's closing period. Hamilton was aware from previous experience earlier in the season that the method to pass a driver was to do so when <b>tyre</b> <b>grip</b> was optimal otherwise {{it would not have been}} possible to draw close enough to affect a passing manoeuvre. He recorded the fastest lap of the race at that point to move within seven-tenths of a second behind teammate Rosberg by the start of lap 28, causing debate among the Mercedes pit lane members.|$|E
25|$|Marciello set {{what was}} at that point a new fastest lap of the race as he drew closer to Rosenqvist. Ocon could not resist a {{challenge}} from Sainz and lost tenth while the struggling Jaafar was overtaken by Korjus on the next lap. Mason was black-flagged as he opted to continue racing and not take his penalty. Rosenqvist concentrated on not allowing Marciello get close to him while Félix da Costa and Derani was waiting to capitalise on any mistakes. Sainz gained a further place by overtaking Coletti for ninth. Giovinazzi battled Gelael for seventeenth with ended in Giovinazzi's favour. Giovanazzi then gained a further place by getting ahead of Wolf for sixteenth. Coletti lost ninth to Ocon in the closing stages of the race while Korjus pulled {{to the side of the}} track at Fisherman's Bend with smoke bellowing from his engine. Lynn opened up a two-second advantage over the rest of the field and maintained the lead to win the qualification race and pole position for the main race. He was joined on the front row by Rosenqvist while Marciello completed the podium in spite of being caught by the former as Rosenqvist felt a loss in <b>tyre</b> <b>grip.</b> Behind the two, Félix da Costa followed with Derani in fifth. Sims, King and Bulller were in close formation for positions six to eight and Sainz and Ocon completed the top ten. Coletti, Jaafar, Latifil, Sekiguchi, Giovnazzi, Wolf, Gelael, Nakayama, Chiyo, Bryant-Meisner, Sun, Mason and Korjus rounded out the classified finishers.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear <b>tyre</b> <b>grip.</b> This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes to}} {{approach}} Global Chassis Control (GCC) {{by means of}} model inversion based feedforward with allocation directly on the actuator commands. The available degrees of freedom are used to execute the desired vehicle motion while minimizing the utilization of the <b>tyre’s</b> <b>grip</b> potential. This is done by sampled constrained least-squares optimization of the linearized problem. For compensation of model errors and external disturbances, high gain feedback is applied {{by means of an}} Inverse Disturbance Observer. The presented method is applied on a comparison of eight vehicles with different configuration of actuators for steer, drive, brake and load distribution. The approach shows a transparent and effective {{way to deal with the}} complex issue of GCC in a unitized way. It gives both a base for controller design and a structured way to compare different configurations. In practice, the transparency supports automatic on-board reconfiguration in case of actuator hardware failure. ...|$|R

500|$|In {{his first}} {{race for the}} team, the , Webber took 3rd on the grid but was beaten to the first corner by David Coulthard and {{eventually}} finished the race in fifth which finally matched his effort with Minardi in '02. His best chance to do so though came in the following race in Malaysia. After qualifying fourth, Webber was defending third position having overtaken the Renault of Giancarlo Fisichella at turn 14. An optimistic Fisichella (who was struggling {{due to a lack}} of downforce and <b>tyre</b> <b>grip)</b> slip streamed Webber on the back straight and attempted a counter-pass down the inside of turn 15. Unfortunately, Fisichella locked his brakes and slid into the side of Webber's car, eliminating both drivers from the race. This allowed Heidfeld to inherit third place and Fisichella was later reprimanded by race stewards for causing the incident. It was later revealed that Webber had competed in the first two races suffering a fractured rib, from an injury he had sustained during pre-season testing at Barcelona, though he [...] "didn't want to make a fuss" [...] about it and would be fully fit in time for the [...]|$|E

50|$|The greater force {{downwards}} on the <b>tyres</b> {{gave more}} <b>grip</b> and thus higher cornering speeds. This ground effect had the great {{advantage of being}} a low drag solution unlike conventional wings, meaning that the increased cornering ability was not compromised by a decrease in straight-line speed. If anything, because of the decreased air resistance, the top speed of the car also increased accordingly.|$|R

Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through immobilisation or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a <b>tyre,</b> lose <b>grip,</b> and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|R

Under dynamic driving conditions, however, the torque distribution varies accordingly. The viscous coupling senses rotational speed difference between {{the front and rear}} axles and transmits torque to the end with the most grip (which has lesser axle rpm).|$|E
50|$|The {{track is}} known for its {{distinctive}} black and blue runoff areas known as the Blue Zone.

The final safeguard consists of Tecpro barriers, a modern improvement on tyre barriers.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} how tyres with different road grip affect the stability of passenger cars equipped with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems during winter road conditions. The introduction of ESC in passenger cars has been very positive for traffic safety. An ESC system's function is however dependent on forces between road and tyres. Thus, {{it is not clear}} how important the <b>tyre</b> road <b>grip</b> performance is for the ESC system to function properly. Field tests on ice with six different drivers were used for assessing how well an ESC system can help the driver in a specific critical situation during slippery road conditions, namely a sudden double lane change. Four different studless winter tyres were used in the study: one studless winter tyre for Nordic conditions, and three studless winter tyres for central European conditions. The specific tyres were chosen to represent a large difference of road grip on ice and snow, and winter tyre tests in the media served as a guide for picking out the tyres...|$|R

50|$|The usual {{military}} {{replacement for}} a bar <b>grip</b> <b>tyre</b> today {{is now a}} pattern like the Michelin XCL or 'NATO Pattern'. This consists of large solid rubber blocks, of similar size to the bar grip bars. These blocks are arranged in crosswise bars of three blocks, {{so that there is}} now good water clearance between blocks, both radially and axially. As the blocks are still large though and unsiped, water clearance from the block surface is still poor and the tyres still have a risk of aquaplaning on wet tarmac, compared to a typical road tyre. This pattern is also directional and so wheels should be mounted as either left-side or right-side.|$|R
50|$|The HF Integrale had {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a front transversely mounted {{engine and}} five-speed gearbox. An epicyclic centre differential normally splits the torque 56 per cent {{to the front}} axle, 44 per cent to the rear. A Ferguson viscous coupling balanced the torque split between front and rear axles depending on road conditions and <b>tyre</b> <b>grip.</b> The Torsen rear differential further divides the torque delivered to each rear wheel according to grip available. A shorter final drive ratio (3.111 instead of 2.944 on the HF 4WD) matched the larger 6.5x15 wheels to give 24 mph/1000 rpm (39 km/h per 1000 rpm) in fifth gear.|$|E
50|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; two 90 minute sessions on Friday and one lasting {{an hour on}} Saturday. Hamilton was the fastest driver in the first practice session, ahead of Rosberg and Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen. Chilton's Marussia car was afflicted by an oil leak, resulting in a fire; this restricted him to completing only five timed laps, and he was 21st overall. Hamilton was fastest in the second session, ahead of Rosberg, Vettel and Alonso — although Hamilton had struggled with <b>tyre</b> <b>grip</b> throughout the session. The third session on Saturday morning saw Hamilton again fastest, ahead of Rosberg, Ricciardo and Vettel.|$|E
5000|$|Although officially a Matra, it {{was run by}} the non-works Matra International team of Ken Tyrrell. The MS80 was one of {{the first}} F1 racing cars to be {{designed}} with [...] "wings" [...] for downforce to increase high-speed <b>tyre</b> <b>grip.</b> These were originally introduced into F1 in 1968. Due to some serious racing accidents with the flimsy 1969-type high wing constructions early in the racing season, like all 1969 F1 cars the MS80 was altered to use more sturdy lowered wings, directly attached to the car's body, later on. [...] Only two MS80's were assembled in 1969, a third monocoque was built but remained un-assembled until the EPAF company made it a complete car in 2006. In a 2006 issue of Motor Sport magazine, Jackie Stewart referred to the MS80 as the nicest-handling F1 car he had ever driven.|$|E
50|$|The livery {{of these}} wagons was of {{unpainted}} metal hoppers and black underframes. The hopper support framework was originally brown, then red {{with the introduction}} of the new Railfreight image in the late 1970s. When Railfreight re-invented itself in 1987, a new livery with yellow framework and a large coal sector logo on the hopper side was introduced. Under EWS the framework is now painted maroon. Merry-go-round hoppers were worked hard however, and the typical livery included a coating of coal dust. Some of the terminals served used stationary shunters to move the wagons forward at low speed. These often featured <b>tyred</b> wheels that <b>gripped</b> the wagon sides, resulting in horizontal streaks on the hopper sides.|$|R
5000|$|Sport/performance <b>tyres</b> provide {{excellent}} <b>grip</b> but {{may last}} 1,000 miles (1,600 km) or less. Cruiser and [...] "sport touring" [...] tyres {{try to find}} the best compromise between grip and durability. There is also a type of tyre developed specifically for racing. These tyres offer the highest of levels of grip for cornering. Because of the high temperatures at which these tyres typically operate, use on the street is unsafe as the tyres will typically not reach optimum temperature before a rider arrives at the destination, thus providing almost no grip en route. In racing situations, racing tyres would normally be brought up to temperature in advance by the use of tyre warmers.|$|R
40|$|Tribology touches {{every aspect}} of our day to day {{existence}} and the wonder of this is that we are completely unaware how central it is to how we function. Take a snapshot of thebeginning of a normal working day for example. A typical morning start will involve brushing one's teeth with toothpaste containing mild abrasive (with a toothbrush with an optimized design for brushing efficiency), using a shampoo and conditioner which have been tested for frictional properties {{on a wide range of}} hair types, and for those who have the traditional morning fry up - lubricating the pan in advance with cooking oil to provide a boundary layer between the food and the pan and to reduce adhesion and heat transfer. It is clear that tribology plays a major role in our everyday lives. Whether starting out for work by foot, bicycle or car, friction will define whether our shoes or <b>tyres</b> can <b>grip</b> the road surface and whether the brake or clutch will do their job. If it is raining, the speed limit is modified in some countries, testifying to the influence of tribologists in decision making in the transport industries...|$|R
