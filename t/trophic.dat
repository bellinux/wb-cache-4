5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the <b>trophic</b> pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters <b>trophic</b> dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay <b>trophic</b> eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying <b>trophic</b> eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this is most likely to happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different <b>trophic</b> level.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top <b>trophic</b> level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher <b>trophic</b> levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} <b>trophic</b> relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable <b>trophic</b> eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day and}} plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between <b>trophic</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher <b>trophic</b> level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into <b>trophic</b> levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the <b>trophic</b> web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the <b>trophic</b> dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal <b>trophic</b> species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various <b>trophic</b> levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher <b>trophic</b> levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} <b>trophic</b> levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high <b>trophic</b> level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact <b>trophic</b> status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
25|$|Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin feuded {{that the}} {{ecological}} communities acted as food chains with three <b>trophic</b> levels. Subsequent models expanded the argument to food chains {{with more than}} or fewer than three <b>trophic</b> levels. Lauri Oksanen argued that the top <b>trophic</b> level in a food chain increases the abundance of producers in food chains with an odd number of <b>trophic</b> levels (such as in Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin's three <b>trophic</b> level model), but decreases the abundance of the producers in food chains with an even number of <b>trophic</b> levels. Additionally, {{he argued that the}} number of <b>trophic</b> levels in a food chain increases as the productivity of the ecosystem increases.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} can trigger <b>trophic</b> cascades (Jefferies 1997), which {{occur when the}} predators that limit abundance of prey and thereby enhance survival of the next lower <b>trophic</b> level are depleted (Strong 1992). Depletion of top predators releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower <b>trophic</b> level, often the primary producers. <b>Trophic</b> cascades occur across {{a minimum of three}} <b>trophic</b> levels and can impact community dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998). <b>Trophic</b> cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into barrens (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005). Primary triggers of <b>trophic</b> cascades through human action include introduction of invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).|$|E
25|$|For <b>trophic</b> cascades to be ubiquitous, {{communities}} must generally act as food chains, with discrete <b>trophic</b> levels. Most communities, however, have complex food webs. In {{real food}} webs, consumers often feed at multiple <b>trophic</b> levels (omnivory), organisms often change their diet {{as they grow}} larger, cannibalism occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which blur the distinctions between <b>trophic</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{earliest}} documented <b>trophic</b> cascades all occurred in lakes and streams led Donald Strong to speculate that fundamental differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs made <b>trophic</b> cascades primarily an aquatic phenomenon. Strong argued that <b>trophic</b> cascades were restricted to communities with relatively low species diversity, in which {{a small number of}} species could have overwhelming influence and the food web could operate as a linear food chain. Additionally, well documented <b>trophic</b> cascades {{at that point in time}} all occurred in food chains with algae as the primary producer. <b>Trophic</b> cascades, Strong argued, may only occur in communities with fast-growing producers which lack defenses against herbivory.|$|E
25|$|The <b>trophic</b> {{level of}} an {{organism}} is the position it occupies {{on the food}} chain. Fisheries have been systematically overfishing high <b>trophic</b> predatory fish. This {{can result in a}} process called fishing down the food web, whereby the mean <b>trophic</b> level of available marine organisms decreases and the fishing effort must shift towards lower <b>trophic</b> organisms, such as jellyfish. According to the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly, if fishing down the food web continues it will in time reduce people to a diet of jellyfish sandwiches and plankton soup.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trophic</b> cascades are {{powerful}} interactions that strongly regulate biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function. <b>Trophic</b> cascades were originally {{thought to be}} rare, but {{it has become clear}} that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. <b>Trophic</b> cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by bottom-up forces and/or resistant to consumer control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trophic</b> cascades {{occur when}} predators {{in a food}} chain {{suppress}} the abundance of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower <b>trophic</b> level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate <b>trophic</b> level is an herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, zooplanktivorous fish, should decrease, large zooplankton abundance should increase, and phytoplankton biomass should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research {{in many areas of}} ecology. <b>Trophic</b> cascades may also be important for understanding the effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing activities.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish occupy central {{positions}} in the ocean food webs. The position that a fish occupies in a food web is called its <b>trophic</b> level (Greek trophē = food). The organisms it eats are at a lower <b>trophic</b> level, and the organisms that eat it are at a higher <b>trophic</b> level. Forage fish occupy middle levels in the food web, serving as a dominant prey to higher level fish, seabirds and mammals.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} scheme, the first <b>trophic</b> level (level 1) is plants, then herbivores (level 2), and then carnivores (level 3). The <b>trophic</b> level {{is equal to}} one more than the chain length, which {{is the number of}} links connecting to the base. The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero. Ecologists identify feeding relations and organize species into <b>trophic</b> species through extensive gut content analysis of different species. The technique has been improved through the use of stable isotopes to better trace energy flow through the web. It was once thought that omnivory was rare, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. This realization has made <b>trophic</b> classifications more complex.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} a multi-trophic {{interaction}} is a <b>trophic</b> cascade, in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores. Links in a food-web illustrate direct <b>trophic</b> relations among species, {{but there are also}} indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the <b>trophic</b> levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called <b>trophic</b> cascades. <b>Trophic</b> cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing higher <b>trophic</b> {{levels that}} {{naturally}} regulate herbivore populations is also {{recognized as an}} important stressor in kelp forests. As described in the previous section, the drivers and outcomes of <b>trophic</b> cascades are important for understanding spatial-temporal patterns of kelp forests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trophic</b> cascades {{occur when}} predators {{in a food}} web {{suppress}} the abundance or alter the behavior of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower <b>trophic</b> level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate <b>trophic</b> level is a herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, smaller fish that eat zooplankton, should decrease. The resulting increase in zooplankton should, in turn, cause the biomass of its prey, phytoplankton, to decrease.|$|E

Abbreviations: P=Producers, C1=Primary consumers, C2=Secondary consumers, C3=Tertiary consumers, S=Saprotrophs.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{relative}} species abundances {{are described}} {{for a single}} <b>trophic</b> level. Because such species occupy the same <b>trophic</b> level they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources. For example, relative species abundances might describe all terrestrial birds in a forest community or all planktonic copepods in a particular marine environment.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal {{species in}} a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or {{saprophytic}} detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called <b>trophic</b> links. The number of <b>trophic</b> links per consumer {{is a measure of}} food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the <b>trophic</b> links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E
25|$|Classic {{studies in}} kelp forest ecology have largely focused on <b>trophic</b> {{interactions}} (the relationships between organisms and their food webs), particularly the understanding and top-down <b>trophic</b> processes. Bottom-up processes are generally {{driven by the}} abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher <b>trophic</b> levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment. This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher <b>trophic</b> levels. By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower <b>trophic</b> levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests, sea otters (Enhydra lutris) control populations of herbivorous sea urchins through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results {{in the loss of}} physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the keystone species that mediates this <b>trophic</b> cascade. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the California sheephead. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the <b>trophic</b> levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins. However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation. Similar examples exist in Nova Scotia, South Africa, Australia and Chile. The relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control in kelp forest ecosystems and the strengths of <b>trophic</b> interactions continue to be the subject of considerable scientific investigation.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{food web}} {{is derived from}} a series of invasions and <b>trophic</b> substitutions.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hutchinson's {{contributions}} to American limnology came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut. Studies were done on small lakes, such as chemical stratification, oxygen deficits, productivity, and the ecological {{significance of the}} oxidation-reduction potential of lake waters. His four volume Treatise on Limnology became a standard for limnology students. Hutchinson expanded the field of limnology, especially in its ecological and biogeochemical aspects. He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in limnology. His student Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the <b>trophic</b> dynamic concept. Together they looked at energy flows through the lake in the <b>trophic</b> levels of ecosystems. They followed the energy using Hutchinson's notation system in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy {{had to go through}} in order to reach it, this was designated as its <b>trophic</b> level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending <b>trophic</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Assimilation of diet into tissue has a tissue-specific {{fractionation}} {{known as}} the <b>trophic</b> discrimination factor. Diet sources can be tracked through a food web via deuterium isotope profiles, although this is complicated by deuterium having two potential sources - water and food. Food more strongly impacts δD than does exchange with surrounding water, and that signal is seen across <b>trophic</b> levels. However, different organisms derive organic hydrogen in varying ratios of water to food: for example, in quail, 20-30% of organic hydrogen was from water and the remainder from food. The precise percentage of hydrogen from water was dependent on tissue source and metabolic activity. In chironomids, 31-47% of biomass hydrogen derived from water, and in microbes as much as 100% of fatty acid hydrogen {{can be derived from}} water depending on substrate. In caterpillars, diet δD from organic matter correlates linearly with tissue δD. The same relationship does not appear to hold consistently for diet δD from water, however - water derived from either the caterpillar or its prey plant is more deuterium enriched than their organic material. Going up <b>trophic</b> levels from prey (plant) to predator (caterpillar) results in an isotopic enrichment. This same trend of enrichment is seen in many other animals - carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores - and appears to follow 15N relative abundances. Carnivores at the same <b>trophic</b> level tend to exhibit the same level of 2H enrichment. Because, as mentioned earlier, the amount of organic hydrogen produced from water varies between species, a model of <b>trophic</b> level related to absolute fractionation is difficult to make if the participating species are not known. Consistency in measuring the same tissues is also important, as different tissues fractionate deuterium differently. In aquatic systems, tracking <b>trophic</b> interactions is valuable for not only understanding the ecology of the system, but also for determining the degree of terrestrial input. The patterns of deuterium enrichment consistent within <b>trophic</b> levels is a useful tool for assessing the nature of these interactions in the environment.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that {{published}} terrestrial <b>trophic</b> cascades generally involved smaller subsets of the food web (often only a single plant species). This was quite different from aquatic <b>trophic</b> cascades, in which the biomass of producers as a whole were reduced when predators were removed. Additionally, most terrestrial <b>trophic</b> cascades did not demonstrate reduced plant biomass when predators were removed, but only increased plant damage from herbivores. It was unclear if such damage would actually result in reduced plant biomass or abundance. In 2002 a meta-analysis found <b>trophic</b> cascades to be generally weaker in terrestrial ecosystems, meaning that changes in predator biomass resulted in smaller changes in plant biomass. In contrast, {{a study published in}} 2009 demonstrated that multiple species of trees with highly varying autecologies are in fact heavily impacted by the loss of an apex predator. Another study, published in 2011, demonstrated that the loss of large terrestrial predators also significantly degrades the integrity of river and stream systems, impacting their morphology, hydrology, and associated biological communities.|$|E
