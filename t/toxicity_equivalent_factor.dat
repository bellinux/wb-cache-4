Since data obtained in the federal states and in {{the responsibility of the}} German Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture could not be released due to data protection problems and these data were expected to be the main data source, an additional emphasis of this project was set on the detailed observation of the new calculation scheme for TCDD toxicity equivalents by the WHO (WHO-TEq) compared to the established I-TEq scheme by NATO/CCMS. Here we investigated the possibility of implementing the new scheme into existing and future legal regulations. 173 congener specific data sets for dioxins in feedstuffs were found in an extended literature study including data of feed additives, single feedstuffs and compound feed. Partly the dioxin concentrations were near the detection limits, other data were derived from suspicious samples with levels up to 234 I-TEq ng/kg. For the implemented 173 data sets as well as for additional 39 data sets of the CVUA, Freiburg, Germany, TCDD toxicity equivalents were calculated according to NATO/CCMS and WHO, respectively. It could be shown that in most cases and with respect to the data investigated the WHO-TEq is higher than the I-TEq. Observing the congener specific levels we revealed that the effect of doubling the TCDD <b>toxicity</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>factor</b> (TEF) of 12378 -PeCDD in the WHO scheme exceeds the effect of decreasing the WHO-TEF of OCDD and OCDF.

40|$|International audiencePolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{constitute}} {{a family of}} over one hundred compounds and can generally be found in complex mixtures. PAHs metabolites cause DNA damage {{which can lead to}} the development of carcinogenesis. Toxicity assessment of PAH complex mixtures is currently expressed in terms of toxic <b>equivalents,</b> based on <b>Toxicity</b> <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Factors</b> (TEFs). However, the definition of new TEFs for a large number of PAH could overcome some limitations of the current method and improve cancer risk assessment. The current investigation aimed at deriving the relative potency factors of PAHs, based on their genotoxic effect measured in vitro and analyzed with mathematical models. For this purpose, we used a new genotoxic assay (gammaH 2 AX) with two human cell lines (HepG 2 and LS- 174 T) to analyze the genotoxic properties of 13 selected PAHs at low doses after 24 h treatment. The dose-response for genotoxic effects was modeled with a Hill model; equivalency between PAHs at low dose was assessed by applying constraints to the model parameters. In the two cell lines tested, we observed a clear dose-response for genotoxic effects for 11 tested compounds. LS- 174 T was on average ten times more sensitive than HepG 2 towards PAHs regarding genotoxicity. We developed new TEFs, which we named Genotoxic <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Factor</b> (GEF). Calculated GEF for the tested PAHs were generally higher than the TEF usually used.

We aimed to explore integrated urinary biomarkers, assessing the overall urine genotoxicity by in vitro comet and micronucleus assays and measuring urinary 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine. Methods During three consecutive working days, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds were sampled in workplace air of 34 sewage and 30 office workers, as indicators of airborne exposure. The last day, subjects collected their 24 hours urine. Genotoxicity of urinary extracts was assessed by comet and micronucleus assays on a HepG 2 cell line. Using competitive enzymatic immunoassay we evaluated the 24 hours urinary 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine excretion.

40|$|The {{development}} of Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs) {{and their use}} has been gaining momentum over the last decade. It {{has been shown that}} raw EALs degrade in the environment in about one tenth the time of an equivalent mineral based lubricant. Estimates and findings such as these serve to highlight the potential benefits of the EAL products, it is also important however to investigate the by-products of their use to ensure that the benefits are not cancelled by an increase of, for instance, combustion by-products. This thesis compares the emissions from a two-stroke outboard engine when using an EAL and an equivalent mineral lubricant, where the primary objective of the study is to characterise and quantify the pollutants that remain within the water column after combustion. To accomplish this, tests were conducted both in the laboratory (freshwater) and in the field (seawater) for a range of throttle settings. A 1. 9 kW two-stroke outboard engine was set-up in a test tank and water samples were taken from the tank after the engine had been run for a period at each of the throttle settings. The tests were repeated for a 5. 9 kW four-stroke engine, however, the experiments were only conducted in the laboratory (freshwater) and using only a standard mineral lubricant. Statistical analyses of the results were conducted using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A simple dilution model was used to estimate the initial outboard engine emission concentrations, which was extended to determine the concentrations at distances of 1, 10 and 100 metres from the source. An investigation of the Total Toxicity Equivalence of the PAH pollutant concentrations (TEQPAH) was conducted using <b>Toxicity</b> <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Factors</b> (TEFs). Results for both types of engine and in both fresh and seawater showed that even the initial concentrations at the source, in almost all instances, were well below the ANZECC water quality guidelines trigger levels. At a distance of 1 metre from the source all concentrations were well below, and therefore, the Total <b>Toxicity</b> <b>Equivalents</b> of the PAHs were found to be even lower. It is concluded that the emissions from a single outboard engine when using either an EAL or a mineral based lubricant are similar. However, the use of EALs has further reaching advantages in that spilt raw lubricants will degrade in the environment up to 10 times faster than a mineral lubricant. Also EALs are less toxic to aquatic and marine organisms and therefore the benefits of using them has to be viewed from a wider perspective. The results in this thesis for a single outboard engine now form the basis for a more detailed environmental assessment of their impacts...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Street dust mainly is influenceed by {{pollution}} Polycylic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH). PAHs are organic compounds which are formed from carbon and hydrogen {{and two or}} more benzene rings. Presence of these compounds in the dust of the street, from various sources in the city, like traffic and industry and may also affect {{human health and the}} environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of compounds on human health and the environment. Materials & methods: In order to assess and determine the possible origin of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the street dust of Ahvaz city, 10 samples of dust were collected from the city in March 2014. After preparation, the samples were analyzed by GC / MS. To determine the possible source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, geochemical aromatic ratios, statistical analysis, cluster analysis (CA), and principal components analysis (PCA) were used. Findings: From 16 PAHs determined by the EPA, 13 PAHs were detected in dust samples. The total concentrations of PAHs were detected between 271. 56 to 3211. 58 Ppb. The ΣCOMB / ΣPAH was between 0. 53 to 0. 71 Ppb with 0. 66 Ppb average. Ant / (Ant + Phe) was between 0. 10 to 0. 37 Ppb and BaA / (BaA + Chr) between 0. 17 and 0. 57 Ppb and IND / (IND + BGP) between 0. 28 and 0. 37 Ppb respectively. Probable carcinogenic were calculated by the <b>toxicity</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>factor</b> (TEF) for PAHs in all sampling stations, it was lower than value of which is determined by Canada to protect human health (600 BaPeq Ppb). Discussion & Conclusions: The results indicate pyrogenic source for PAH of street dust and combustion of fossil fuels. B (a) P is most cancer PAH compound, were detected in all sampling stations with different concentrations. Also, the result indicate that Ahvaz city is intensively affected by the oil and gas upstream and down industries and PAHs can correlate with this industries...|$|E

Blood levels of the congeners of PCDD/Fs were determined in four groups of humans, One group had clinically risible chloracne due to exposure in a hexachlorobenzene workshop of a large chemical factory A second group was exposed in the satire workshop, but had no skin changes. There were two control groups: one non-exposed group of maintenance workers from the same chemical factory, and one group of healthy individuals living elsewhere.

40|$|The toxic {{equivalency}} {{concept is}} a widely applied method to express the toxicity of complex mixtures of compounds that act via receptor-mediated mechanisms such as induction of the arylhydrocarbon or estrogen receptors. Here we propose to extend this concept to baseline toxicity, using the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri, and an integrative ecotoxicity endpoint, algal growth rate inhibition. Both bioassays were validated by comparison with literature data and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for baseline toxicity were developed for all endpoints. The novel combined algae test, with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, allows for the simultaneous evaluation of specific inhibition of photosynthesis and growth rate. The contributions of specific inhibition of photosynthesis and non-specific toxicity could be differentiated by comparing the time and endpoint pattern. Photosynthesis efficiency, measured with the saturation pulse method after 2 h of incubation, served as indicator of specific inhibition of photosynthesis by photosystem II inhibitors. Diuron equivalents were defined as <b>toxicity</b> <b>equivalents</b> for this effect. The endpoint of growth rate over 24 h served to derive baseline <b>toxicity</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (baseline-TEQ).

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that breaking low-exponent rsa cannot be <b>equivalent</b> to <b>factoring</b> integers. We show that an algebraic reduction from factoring to breaking low-exponent rsa can be converted into an e cient factoring algorithm. Thus, in e ect an oracle for breaking rsa does not help in factoring integers. Our result suggests {{an explanation for the}} lack of progress in proving that breaking rsa is <b>equivalent</b> to <b>factoring.</b> We emphasize that our results do not expose any speci c weakness in the rsa system...|$|R
