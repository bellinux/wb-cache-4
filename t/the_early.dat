Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> childhood program.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land {{to increase the}} estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments.

This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1970s.

5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named.
