His papal bull addressed to King Edward in these terms was firmly rejected on Edward's behalf by the Barons' Letter of 1301. The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however. In 1303, a peace agreement was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance. Robert the Bruce, the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301–02. By 1304, most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, and this year the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle. A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed. With Scotland largely under English control, Edwardinstalled Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country.|$|E

In fact, Domnall's father and grandfather had excluded the Kingdom of Leinster from overlordship of Dublin for the last forty years. Furthermore, not only was Conchobar was an unremitting opponent of Domnall's father, but Donnchad possessed several links to the kingship of Dublin as he was married to Domnall mac Taidc's sister, and further had a claim of his own, as both his father and grandfatherMurchad and Diarmait mac Maíl na mBóheld the kingship during their own careers.|$|E

Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the [...] "adverse possessor" [...] would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1623, just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims. Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely {{to the interests of}} the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of [...] "possession" [...] that was [...] "adverse" [...] were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> Different rules are in place for the limitation periods of adverse possession in unregistered land and registered land.

Madame de Vionnet greeted her as [...] "Duchesse" [...] and was greeted in turn, while talk started in French, as [...] "Ma toute-belle"; little facts that had their due, their vivid interest for Strether. Madame de Vionnet didn't, none the less, introduce him--a note he was conscious of as false to the Woollett scale and the Woollett humanity; though it didn't prevent the Duchess, who struck him as confident and free, very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses, from looking at him as straight and as hard--for it WAS hard--as if she would have liked, all the same, to know him. [...] "Oh yes, my dear, it's all right, it's ME; and who are YOU, with your interesting wrinkles and your most effective (is it the handsomest, is it the ugliest?) of noses?"--some such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed, fragrantly enough, to fling at him.

When commissioners from New York and Vermont met to decide on the boundary, Vermont's negotiators insisted on also settling the property ownership disputes with New Yorkers, rather than leaving that to be decided later in a federal court. The negotiations were successfully concluded in October 1790 with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under New York land patents. In January 1791, a convention in Vermont voted 105–4 to petition Congress to become a state in the federal union.

40|$|Abstract—In recent work, we {{have argued}} for a formal {{treatment}} of confidence about the claims made in dependability cases for software-based systems. The key idea underlying this work is “the inevitability of uncertainty”: It is rarely possible <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> that <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> about safety or reliability is true with certainty. Much of this uncertainty is epistemic in nature, so it seems inevitable that expert judgment will continue {{to play an important}} role in dependability cases. Here, we consider a simple case where an expert makes <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> about the probability of failure on demand (pfd) of a subsystem of a wider system and is able to express his confidence about that claim probabilistically. An important, but difficult, problem then is how such subsystem (claim, confidence) pairs can be propagated through a dependability case for a wider system, of which the subsystems are components. An informal way forward is to justify, at high confidence, <b>a</b> strong <b>claim,</b> and then, conservatively, only claim something much weaker: “I’m 99 percent confident that the pfd is less than 10 5, so it’s reasonable to be 100 percent confident that it is less than 10 3. ” These conservative pfds of subsystems can then be propagated simply through the dependability case of the wider system.

40|$|In certain {{circumstances}} {{the law has}} seen competing claims made to goods by persons who do not own them and who have come into possession of them without the consent or knowledge of the owner of them. Such claims may be made, typically, where goods which have been lost by their owner are found by someone who takes possession of them; or where goods have been stolen and are {{in the possession of}} the thief or a person who has received or taken them from the thief. In such cases, of course, the proprietary title of the owner remains paramount but, in the absence of <b>an</b> owner <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> such <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> the question of entitlement to found or stolen goods may be disputed by other parties who have taken possession of the goods, dealt with them in some way or had some relation to them. In such disputes, legal proceedings, usually in conversion, may be undertaken by the plaintiff with the purpose of establishing an interest in the goods sufficient to prevail over any claimed interest of the defendant. 1 The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the interests involved in cases of found and stolen goods, and to describe the way in which the law deals with rival claims in such cases. The nature of the possessory right necessary to found a successful conversion action in the absence of the true owner of goods is central to such a discussion, and an attempt will be made to analyse the principles involved in this context in establishing such a right. In particular, this paper revisits and questions the correctness of the reasoning in Costello v Chief Constable of Derbyshire, 2 which equated the interests of finders, thieves and other wrongdoers; and concludes that the decision failed to make the necessary distinction between the respective rights in goods of finders, thieves and others who are in possession of unlawfully obtained goods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the causal pathways underpinning the moderation of radical ethno-nationalism using {{the case of}} Irish republicanism (Sinn Féin and the IRA) between 1969 and 2010. Through {{the application of the}} ‘inclusion-moderation’ framework, I argue that a strong macro-institutional framework is central to the process of moderation. Existing explanations that emphasise the role of interplay, exchange and leadership choices typically neglect the importance of this wider institutional framework in enabling and shaping the decisions made. In the case of Irish republicanism, the processes of electoral participation, bargaining to design stable democratic institutions, and securing credible guarantees to protect their interests from the United States, all combined and reinforced each other to create a scenario whereby republicans moderated. These processes hinged upon stable democratic institutions that were perceived by republicans as embodying relatively low risks for participation, providing a stable basis for future competition, and rendering the future of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom potentially uncertain. Moderation was a gradual and path-dependent process of increasing returns whereby contact with the stable institutions imposed constraints against radicalism and incentives towards moderation. Republicanism’s transformation is best understood as moving through a series of phases, beginning with absolute radicalism, moving to relative radicalism, before becoming moderate. Crucial to this process was the decision to participate in institutions, which changed and regulated their relationships with other actors, requiring them to build alliances with potential supporters and political opponents. However, moderation was a layered process with some aspects of their policies and beliefs becoming moderate while others remained radical, albeit over time their remaining radicalism became completely accommodating. This was about acquiescing to a system of political order rather than core value change. Republicans continue <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>an</b> alternative <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> sovereignty, reject the legitimacy of British ruling institutions, and continue <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> the legitimacy of their right to armed struggle, albeit they have put the use of violence in their past. As such, rather than thinking of ethno-national radicalism as entailing value change to prove the sincerity of their moderation, it is preferable to look to the ways they demonstrated a commitment to their new moderate path, such as through the process of decommissioning, their endorsement of policing in Northern Ireland, and their response to ongoing threats of violence from former dissident comrades. In short, the inclusion-moderation theory is a powerful approach for explaining ethno-national moderation but it needs some modification for the ethno-national context...|$|R

One has to believe that the Tlaxcalla Compact may have given rise to the chicano legend of the return of the Quetzalcuatl to unify a broken Aztlan.

40|$|After {{a century}} of disregard, the {{question}} of whether patents are entitled to protection under the Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Takings Clause has recently become a topic of scholarly and judicial debate. While one might have expected this issue to have been settled long before, it is only the recent burgeoning of patentholders 2 ̆ 7 regulatory takings claims that has made this question one of pressing interest. Thus far scholarship on the issue has focused on whether or not patents have historically been characterized as property. Meanwhile, last year 2 ̆ 7 s rejection by the Federal Circuit of a patentholder 2 ̆ 7 s right <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> Takings Clause <b>claim</b> led to both external criticism as well as a vocal dissent by an esteemed member of that court. Considering the issue from a new angle, this article demonstrates that determination of patents 2 ̆ 7 status as property is a relevant but incomplete analysis of the constitutional question. That is because the Supreme Court has already concluded that some property interests, particularly federal benefits, are entitled to Due Process Clause protection but are not entitled to Takings Clause protection. Patents are similar federal entitlements, offered only because they serve society, and thus they are not entitled to the full panoply of constitutional protections. Moreover, if patentholders could assert regulatory takings claims, the fear of costly claims could very well deter the government from making worthwhile policy changes. For instance, there is currently significant public concern about the high prices of pharmaceuticals resulting from drug companies 2 ̆ 7 patent privileges. Refusing to grant patentholders the right to a Takings Clause remedy will prevent society from being stuck with earlier suboptimal patent policies. In sum, permitting patents to trigger takings claims is neither compelled by modern Supreme Court precedent nor wise as a policy matter...|$|R

As mandated by the ADEA, you file a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Commission investigates and grants you the authority to file a civil suit in federal court. In court, the judge informs you that the ADEA is not applicable against the states. You petition the court to amend your complaint, you now wish <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> § 1983 <b>claim</b> against your supervisor in his official capacity for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court denies your claim based on circuit precedent: the ADEA is the exclusive remedy for age discrimination in employment. Until 2012, every circuit to consider the issue concluded that the ADEA precludes a § 1983 equal protection remedy. In 1989, in Zombro v. Baltimore City Police Department, the Fourth Circuit held that the ADEA precludes constitution-based § 1983 age-discrimination claims. Incorrectly, the court applied a preclusion analysis reserved for statute-based § 1983 claims. Since that time, most circuits have relied on the Fourth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s problematic analysis and holding, those decisions have effectively eliminated a federal remedy for state employees suffering from age discrimination in employment. The dependence on Zombro suggests that courts do not understand the applicable preclusion analysis. In 2012, the Seventh Circuit in Levin v. Madigan became the first circuit to hold that the ADEA does not preclude § 1983 equal protection claims. Although the Seventh Circuit applied an improper analysis, it is the only circuit to engage in a comparative evaluation of the rights offered under the ADEA to the rights offered under § 1983 equal protection claims. The Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision diminishes the precedential value of Zombro and its progeny. Based on Supreme Court precedent, this Comment demonstrates that no circuit court has applied the proper preclusion analysis to the ADEA 2 ̆ 7 s preclusion of § 1983 equal protection <b>claims.</b> <b>As</b> such, it proposes the proper standard for determining the preclusion of constitution-based § 1983 claims. Finally, this Comment applies its proposed test to the ADEA and § 1983. By expanding on the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s comparative evaluation, this Comment concludes that the ADEA does not preclude § 1983 equal protection claims...|$|R
