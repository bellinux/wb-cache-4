The open hall, with its 16-pointed star plan is most unusual design built by Hoysala architects. The central ceiling in the closed mantapa and the vestibule are decorated elaborately.|$|R

As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E

5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid.

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, {{in this case the}} competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
