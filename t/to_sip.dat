25|$|In {{its most}} ancient form, the evening commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops. Celebrants would observe the moon to divine {{the future of}} the people and harvests. Eventually the celebration came to symbolize a reverence for fertility, with prayers given for {{bountiful}} harvests, increase in livestock, and human babies. Over time, the prayers for children evolved into a celebration of children. Confucian scholars continued the tradition of gazing at the moon, but <b>to</b> <b>sip</b> wine and improvise poetry and song. By the early twentieth century in Hanoi, the festival had begun to assume its identity as a children's festival.|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines <b>to</b> <b>sip</b> from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E

Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics labelled the single [...] "fresh and funky", confessing that he likes it better than its predecessors [...] "1.000.000" [...] (2012) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Furthermore, Apaza foreseed [...] "Lemonade" [...] as a club hit with the help of [...] "a few killer remixes". MTV declared the song as being [...] "catchy", while stating that [...] "you'd be hard-pressed to turn down a glass of what Stan’s serving this summer".

500|$|Bavaro {{continued}} his emergence in the 1986 season. He remained the starter after Mowatt's recovery from injury and {{emerged as a}} favorite target of Simms. He finished the season with 66 receptions, 1,001yards, and 4 touchdowns and was selected to his first Pro Bowl. His 66 receptions broke the Giants record for receptions by a tight end previously held by Bob Tucker (59). Perhaps the most well-known play of Bavaro's career occurred in a Monday Night Football game in 1986. Here is {{a description of the}} play taken from a Monday Night Football broadcast in 2005: [...] "On Dec. 1 1986, New York Giants tight end Mark Bavaro cements his {{reputation as one of the}} toughest men in the NFL. With the Giants trailing, Bavaro catches an innocent pass from Phil Simms over the middle. It takes nearly seven 49ers defenders to finally drag him down, some of which are carried for almost 20yards, including future Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott. Bavaro’s inspiring play jump starts the Giants, who win the game and eventually the Super Bowl." [...] This reputation as a tough player was further cemented later in the season when he played for six weeks with a broken jaw that forced him <b>to</b> <b>sip</b> food through a straw. He continued to establish his reputation as an excellent blocker during the season, and was described as [...] "the premier tight end" [...] in the league by 49ers' coach Bill Walsh before the team's playoff matchup. The Giants finished the regular season 14–2 and defeated the Denver Broncos 39–20 in Super Bowl XXI. After the season Bavaro was chosen to appear on the cover or Sports Illustrated's NFL preview issue for the 1987 season. Bavaro was pictured on the cover in a cutoff shirt holding his shoulder pads over his shoulder, the caption reads [...] "The Living End: Mark Bavaro of the New York Giants". The cover also featured Bavaro celebrating a touchdown in the trademark manner of his career. [...] Bavaro, a Roman Catholic, would genuflect in the end zone and motion the sign of the cross after each touchdown.|$|E

40|$|RODA-in is an offline tool {{designed}} to easily create thousands of SIPs with gigabytes of data {{in an easy}} to use way. This is possible by using aggregation rules, which map files and folders <b>to</b> <b>SIPs,</b> and metadata association rules, which add metadata <b>to</b> the created <b>SIPs.</b> The basic workflow can be defined in a sequence of easy steps where the user starts by selecting the folders to be archived and then chooses which patterns {{will be used to}} transform the data in SIPs. As an optional step, it’s possible to edit the generated <b>SIPs</b> <b>to</b> either enrich them or fix exceptions to the rule. Lastly, it’s possible to export to two different formats: BagIt and E-ARK SIP. In this paper we present and discuss all the decisions and ideas taken to implement RODA-in like which workflow should be used, what aggregation and metadata association options are currently implemented, how the metadata templating system works and which other features can be used <b>to</b> enrich the <b>SIPs.</b> This work was co-founded by the E-ARK project, an EC funded pilot action project in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme 2007 - 2013, Grant Agreement no. 620998 under the Policy Support Programme. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant took Abraham's bounty and ten of Abraham's camels and {{traveled}} to Aram-Naharaim, {{the city of}} Nahor. He made the camels kneel by the well outside the city at evening, when women come out to draw water. The servant asked God to grant that the maiden whom he would ask to draw water for him and who replied by offering also to water his camels might be the one whom God had decreed for Isaac. He had scarcely finished speaking when Rebekah, the beautiful virgin daughter of Abraham's nephew Bethuel, came out with her jar on her shoulder, {{went down to the}} spring, filled her jar, and came up. The servant ran toward her and asked <b>to</b> <b>sip</b> a little water from her jar, and she quickly let him drink and when he had drunk his fill, she offered to draw water for his camels until they finish drinking. When the camels had finished drinking, the servant took a gold nose-ring and two gold bands for her arms, and asked her whose daughter she was and whether there was room in her father's house for him to spend the night. She identified herself and told him that there was plenty of straw and feed and room at her home for him to spend the night. The servant bowed low to God.

40|$|Shelter-in-place (SIP) is {{considered}} a credible alternative to immediate evacuation to protect the population on and around Army chemical warfare agent stockpile storage sites from accidental agent releases of short duration. To be effective, this strategy requires immediate <b>SIP</b> <b>to</b> minimize initial exposure to agent vapor, followed by timely and appropriate termination of <b>SIP</b> <b>to</b> minimize additional exposure to agent vapor accumulations in the shelter when the air outside becomes less hazardous. However, a major challenge facing emergency managers has been how to decide the best time and way <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> <b>to</b> obtain this ideal. This report describes a concept to make this decision, and suggests a methodology to apply the concept as a site-specific response tool. The major conditions that influence the exposure of a population are the source term values of the agent that is released, meteorological conditions, shelter air change rates, {{the distance of the}} shelter from the source, and th e dose-response relationship of the hazardous material. The circumstances that contribute to overall exposure associated with a SIP strategy involve exposure during the time before taking shelter, exposure while sheltered due to vapor infiltration, and additional exposure (if any) following the termination of <b>SIP.</b> Options <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> are <b>to</b> resume normal activities with no restrictions, to ventilate the shelter but remain indoors, to exit from the shelter and remain nearby, or to relocate to a designated facility. The optimal time and way <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> involves examining the relationships among the conditions and circumstances listed above to find the combination of these variables that gives the smallest area where a sheltered population might receive a certain level of toxic effect. For example, find the combination of times, conditions, and circumstances that produce the smallest area where fatalities are possible. In this case, the best time and action <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> <b>to</b> minimize fatalities is that combination of variables which produces the smallest area where this level of effect is expected. The methodology to apply the concept is to use a computer model to examine the relationships among these conditions and circumstances (many of which are pre-planned default inputs), and display the best time and action <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> quickly, in a user-friendly format. A computer model that was developed to prove the concept and demonstrate the methodology (called the TSIP Model) is described in the report, {{and the use of the}} TSIP Model is illustrated in a case study in an appendix to the report. The report also discusses public education and emergency instructions essential for implementing this concept, and makes recommendations for agreements, plans, and exercises relevant to deciding when and how <b>to</b> end <b>SIP.</b> This concept and methodology is independent of the atmospheric dispersion model used, and is not limited to chemical warfare agent vapor hazards. Thus it can help make decisions on when and how <b>to</b> end <b>SIP</b> following the accidental release of many other non-flammable non-reactive hazardous vapors if sufficient information is available about the characteristics of the material and the circumstances of the release...|$|R
