5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility {{to prevent it from}} destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E

40|$|Helicases {{that both}} unwind and rewind DNA have central roles in DNA repair and genetic recombination. In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> unwinding, DNA <b>rewinding</b> by helicases has proved difficult to characterize biochemically {{because of its}} thermodynamically downhill nature. Here we use single-molecule assays to mechanically destabilize a DNA molecule and follow, in real time, unwinding and rewinding by two DNA repair helicases, bacteriophage T 4 UvsW and Escherichia coli RecG. We find that both enzymes are robust rewinding enzymes, which can work against opposing forces as large as 35 pN, revealing their active character. The generation of work during the rewinding reaction allows them <b>to</b> couple <b>rewinding</b> <b>to</b> DNA unwinding and/or protein displacement reactions central {{to the rescue of}} stalled DNA replication forks. The overall results support a general mechanism for monomeric rewinding enzymes...|$|R
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E
25|$|Although the TDK-D C180 was {{produced}} {{for a decade}} (1972–82), it is very rare, because of several technical flaws. The tape had to be so thin that it was nearly transparent and therefore had fewer particles to magnetize, resulting in a poor sound quality and even worse durability. It required a strong motor to be driven, and had high wow-and-flutter. Finally, it took a relatively long time <b>to</b> <b>rewind.</b>|$|E

Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up <b>to</b> forty <b>rewinds</b> <b>to</b> incorporate everything.|$|R

25|$|The series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa had a direct-to-video film named Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa, with Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella reprising {{their roles}} as Timon and Pumbaa respectively. The story tells of Pumbaa getting struck by {{lightning}}, losing all his memory, and Timon helps refrain every moment they spent. After Pumbaa gets his memory back, lightning strikes Timon losing his memory this time, making Pumbaa break the fourth wall by telling the viewers <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the tape {{to start at the}} beginning, being {{it was the only way}} to help Timon remember. Several episodes from the series are featured in this film. Aside from this film, two other DVDs, Dining Out... and On Holiday... are an hour compilation of other episodes of the series. No DVDs have been released in the U.S. but were released on VHS.|$|E
25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father {{in a place called}} Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the armature and convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E
500|$|Concept {{work began}} in spring of 2001, after Ubisoft {{acquired}} the Prince of Persia catalog. After Mechner was brought on board, production began in June of that year. After the initial story draft was scrapped {{as it was}} too complex, the team began with four guiding concepts, including the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time: this idea grew into the Dagger, the Sands, and the various powers related to them. Mechner's script drew inspiration from the Shahnameh, with the main focus on creating a simple narrative that worked with the pace of gameplay. The game used Ubisoft's Jade engine, originally designed for Beyond Good & Evil, another game published by the company. Production was troubled, with the team facing problems with the engine structure and delays with environment assets, while also managing to create an effective tester network {{to seek out the}} game's bugs. [...] In 2004, a version for mobile phones was developed and published in North America by Gameloft.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs were}} well {{received}} by the audience and the track [...] "O Podu", in particular, was a hit. Following the song's success, Vikram was greeted everywhere with screams of [...] "O Podu". He was overwhelmed by the response and, having already worked as a voice artist and singer, offered to sing {{his version of the}} song to which the producers agreed. According to Vikram, the song was recorded and filmed the same morning, and was added to the soundtrack album a month after its initial release. The film had been completed by then and the additional track was featured during the closing credits. Initially, a small footage featuring Vikram and Kiran was sent to the cinemas for screening during the end credits. However, the audience were dissatisfied with the shortened version of the song and forced theatre owners <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the song and play it again. After receiving calls from distributors and theatre owners, the makers eventually sent the entire song.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{title was}} thought {{up by the}} {{production}} team, but the original story built around the title proved impossible to work. The original draft had nine characters (including the Prince, two love interests, two villains, and two helper characters) representing different political factions, and {{the setting of the}} Prince's own palace home instead of in another kingdom. This storyline ultimately impeded other aspects of development, and so was scrapped. In starting over, the team returned to [...] "The Sands of Time" [...] title and concept. They decided upon four key elements for the game: [...] "Unity of time and place", with the game taking place over twenty-four hours within the palace of Azad; [...] "Acrobatics", referring to the gameplay and how the setting was constructed around this concept; [...] "Combat", with the palace being filled with monsters to give the game and story a fast-paced feeling; and [...] "Rewind", the ability to turn back and manipulate time. One of the early decisions made by the production team was not to refer to Prince of Persia 3D in any degree in designing the gameplay, instead looking to the 1989 original for reference. They intended to capture the original feeling of platforming an adventure in a 3D environment. The Rewind mechanic began as a gameplay wish for the title, surviving the initial rewrite of the story and becoming key to both story and gameplay. The Dagger of Time and the Sands were both born from the need to explain this mechanic in-game. The initial concept was simply using the Dagger <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time and dispatch enemies, but its powers were gradually expanded into its current roster. The main character's acrobatics were designed to be novel to the video game medium, inspired by similar stunts performed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. A video game which provided inspiration for the acrobatic feats of the Prince was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Elements such as using ladders as part of combat, and riding on a magic carpet or a horse were axed early in development. The Rewind function was suggested by the game's director Patrice Désilets based on experiences playing , where he had wished <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> after making a mistake rather than restarting the entire level.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a still photo of Rowland and a [...] "slide-lock" [...] {{function}} from the iPad in the foreground. A single finger appears and unlocks the image by sliding the slider from left to right. The music begins and four small images appear on screen. The finger reappears and clicks on the third image, resulting in that image zooming to fit the whole screen. In this scene, Rowland wears an orange knee-length skirt, T-shirt, and a blue cropped denim jacket. She walks around on a rooftop in Los Angeles. The video then flicks between this scene and another where she is seen partying with her friends. As the chorus begins, Rowland and her friends are seen riding in a convertible car. Then they are seen sitting on some concrete stairs as some skate-boarders ride past them. When the bridge kicks in, the images flicker to a party scene on a rooftop with lots of people enjoying themselves. The finger then re-appears and clicks on the scroll bar, which appears on screen as if <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the clip and the original scene of Rowland alone on the rooftop plays as the music fades.|$|E

500|$|Life Is Strange {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} town of Arcadia Bay, Oregon, and is told from the {{perspective}} of Maxine [...] "Max" [...] Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling tornado. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) accidentally kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time and rescues the girl; revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price (Ashly Burch). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town. The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a party. It is implied that she was drugged, and Max suspects Nathan as the perpetrator.|$|E
500|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013 {{with a team}} of 15, and more people were added when the {{collaboration}} with Square Enix began. [...] Dontnod told Square Enix about Life Is Strange only after Square Enix turned down a pitch for a larger game. Before signing with Square Enix, Life Is Strange was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The game was originally codenamed What If but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. Life Is Strange was born of the idea for the rewind mechanic, which the developer had already experimented on with their last game Remember Me. The lead character Max was created with the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time to supplement this mechanism. The episodic format was decided upon by the studio for creative reasons, financial restrictions and marketing purposes, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace. The Pacific Northwest was picked as the setting for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{follows from}} its {{predecessor}} in simulating {{the performance of}} a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit as shipped previously with DJ Hero, includes a rotatable turntable to use for recording scratching, three [...] "stream" [...] buttons to match notes from the two music tracks and an effects track, and a slider to control the crossfade between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a [...] "Euphoria" [...] (the [...] "Star Power" [...] for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring.|$|E
50|$|Even thinner tapes fitting 3600' on a seven-inch reel and 1800' on a five-inch reel {{were known}} as triple-play tapes. Triple-play tape was too fragile for many tape decks <b>to</b> safely <b>rewind</b> even on a full seven-inch reel, and was more {{commonly}} used on five-inch- and smaller reels. However 3600' tapes on seven-inch reels were commercially available for those who wanted them.|$|R

40|$|Article history: The {{dynamics}} of the winder roller of a roll-to-roll printing system for printed electronics is a time-varying system because of the variation of the winder roller radius owing <b>to</b> <b>rewinding</b> or unwinding of the web. Therefore, an adaptive control method considering the time-variant characteristics is required for precise tension control. In this study, the variable PID gain method {{is applied to the}} actual roll-to-roll system and verified by experiments for unwinder tension control. The required value of the winder roller radius for the application of the variable PID gain is estimated from the measurement of the winder tension and winder motor torque. The simulation results as well as experimental results show that the fixed PID gain control cannot stabilize the tension of the winder roller with varying winder roller radius. On the other hand, the variable PID gain method can control the tension of the winder roller regardless of the winder roller radius...|$|R
500|$|In Overwatch, Tracer is {{classified}} as an [...] "offense" [...] character. She is also listed as a two-star (medium) difficulty character for players. Reflecting her offensive role, she comes equipped with dual [...] "Pulse Pistols," [...] which reload quickly and deal damage rapidly at a short range. Her speed is especially noted by video game media, as she is the fastest character on the game's roster. This attribute is noted {{to be one of}} the advantages that comes with playing as her, but also an annoyance to opposing players. Her speed is supplemented through her [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "Recall" [...] abilities—Blink, which comes with three charges, allows her to teleport a short distance in the same direction she is traveling. Using this ability may allow Tracer to [...] "zip behind an enemy in an instant for surprise attacks, or dodge completely out of the line of fire". This ability has a cooldown period, meaning the player has to wait for each Blink to recharge, although the cooldown period is relatively short. In addition, her Recall ability allows her <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> to her position three seconds prior, as well as resetting her health and ammo. Like Blink, her Recall ability also has a cooldown period. Although Tracer has a speed advantage, she also has one of the lowest health pools in the game. Finally, her ultimate ability is her [...] "Pulse Bomb": a sticky that clings to the first surface or hero it hits, then detonates shortly after, dealing area of effect damage.|$|E
500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero {{primarily}} simulates turntablism, {{a musical}} style used by disc jockeys {{to create a}} new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 [...] "stream" [...] buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a [...] "Euphoria" [...] button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable {{in the direction of the}} arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. [...] "Euphoria" [...] is equivalent to Guitar Heros Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a [...] "Rewind" [...] meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player <b>to</b> <b>rewind</b> the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.|$|E
