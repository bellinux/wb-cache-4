40|$|Figure 1 : Three nested {{refinement}} domains for hierarchies of tetrahedra and diamonds. <b>The</b> <b>descendant</b> domain (left) is {{the limit}} {{shape of the}} domain covered by all descendants of a given diamond (colored). Due to the fractal nature of these shapes, we introduce the more conservative convex descendant domain (middle) and bounding box descendant domain (right) to simplify the computation while still tightly covering <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> domain. In each case, the refinement domain {{of one of the}} diamond’s parents, grandparents and great-grandparents is shown. We investigate several families of polyhedra defining nested refinement domains for hierarchies generated through longest edge tetrahedral bisection. We define <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> domain of a tetrahedron as the domain covered by all possible descendants generated by conforming bisections. Due to the fractal nature of these shapes, we propose two simpler approximations to <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> domain that are relatively tight with respect to <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> domain and can be implicitly computed at runtime. We conclude with a brief discussion of the applications of these shapes for interactive view– dependent volume visualization and isosurface extraction. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete the account of <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, Yaropolk {{became the}} son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's {{security}} were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great; namely, the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> of Izyaslav Vladimirovich.|$|E
5|$|In 1067, Vseslav rebelled in {{an attempt}} to {{overthrow}} Izyaslav and become Grand Prince himself, claiming the right as a great-grandson of Vladimir the Great through Izyaslav Vladimirovich. Vseslav's attempt was unsuccessful, and ended in his imprisonment. Troubles for Izyaslav were to continue though. In 1068, Izyaslav's alleged negligence to the advances and incursions of the Cuman people (Polovtsy) after the defeat at the Battle of the Alta River led the citizens of Kiev to revolt; Vseslav was released, and took the Kievan throne while Izyaslav fled to Boleslaw in Poland. With Polish assistance Izyaslav returned in May 1069, expelled Vseslav and retook the throne. This victory for Izyaslav secured the Kievan throne for <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> of Yaroslav Vladimirovich, and thereafter <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> of Izyaslav Vladimirovich confined themselves to Polotsk where they reigned with semi-independent status.|$|E

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{fragment of}} first-order logic is obtained by restricting quantification to blocks of existential quantifiers that leave at most one variable free.

Here we investigate the one-dimensional fragment over trees. We consider unranked unordered trees accessible by one or both of <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> and child relations, as well as ordered trees equipped additionally with sibling relations. We show that over unordered trees the satisfiability problem is ExpSpace-complete when only <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> relation is available and 2 ExpTime-complete with both <b>the</b> <b>descendant</b> and child or with only the child relation. Over ordered trees the problem remains 2 ExpTime-complete.
