5|$|When a <b>T-cell</b> {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the <b>T-cell</b> to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the <b>T-cell</b> extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the <b>T-cell</b> expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E

Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper <b>T-cell</b> maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E

However, the precise mechanism leading to NKG 2 D expression on HCMV-specific CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> is currently not known. In this study we used genome-wide analysis of individual genes and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the gene expression profile of NKG 2 D(+) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells,</b> generated from HCMV-primed CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells.</b> We show that the HCMV-primed NKG 2 D(+) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> possess a higher differentiated phenotype than the NKG 2 D(-) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells,</b> both at the gene expression profile and cytokine profile. The ability to express NKG 2 D at the cell surface was primarily determined by the activation or differentiation status of the CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> and not by the antigen presenting cells. We observed a correlation between CD 94 and NKG 2 D expression in the CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> following HCMV stimulation. However, knock-down of CD 94 did not affect NKG 2 D cell surface expression or signaling. In addition, we show that NKG 2 D is recycled at the cell surface of activated CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells,</b> whereas it is produced de novo in resting CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells.</b> These findings provide novel information about the gene expression profile of HCMV-primed NKG 2 D(+) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells,</b> {{as well as the}} mechanisms regulating NKG 2 D cell surface expression...|$|R

Here, we investigated the colocalization potential of HIV-specific CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> into the GALT and explored the role of retinoic acid (RA) in regulating this process in a cohort of HIV-infected subjects with slow disease progression. The expression of the gut-homing molecules integrin β 7, CCR 6, and CXCR 3 {{was identified as a}} "signature" for HIV-specific but not CMV-specific CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> thus providing a new explanation for their enhanced permissiveness to infection in vivo. HIV-specific CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> also expressed high levels of integrin β 7 and CXCR 3; however CCR 6 was detected at superior levels on HIV-specific CD 4 (+) versus CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells.</b> All trans RA (ATRA) upregulated the expression of integrin β 7 but not CCR 6 on HIV-specific <b>T-cells.</b> Together, these results suggest that HIV-specific CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> may colocalize in excess with CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> into the GALT via integrin β 7 and CXCR 3, but not via CCR 6. Considering our previous findings that CCR 6 (+) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> are major cellular targets for HIV-DNA integration in vivo, a limited ability of CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> to migrate in the vicinity of CCR 6 (+) CD 4 (+) <b>T-cells</b> may facilitate HIV replication and dissemination at mucosal sites...|$|R

In an in vitro model system, PHA-stimulated <b>T-cells,</b> upon prolonged culture in IL- 2, acquire a sensitive phenotype to Fas-mediated apoptosis. This phenomenon is less pronounced in T 1 DM <b>T-cells.</b> Moreover, the restimulation of activated <b>T-cells</b> via TCR/CD 3 and/or via CD 28 inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis in T 1 DM in comparison to control <b>T-cells.</b> After Fas triggering, the generation of the active sub-units of caspase- 8 is significantly reduced in T 1 DM <b>T-cells</b> restimulated via TCR/CD 3 and/or CD 28.

In this report, we recruited 42 long-term (~ 20 years) treatment-naïve chronic HCV (CHC) patients and 15 healthy donors (HDs) to investigate differences in global CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> function. We show that CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> from CHC patients underwent increased apoptosis after TCR stimulation. Furthermore, IFN-γ, IL- 9 and IP- 10 were elevated in CHC patients' plasma and promoted activation-induced <b>T-cells</b> death. Global CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) <b>T-cells</b> also showed unique transcriptional profiles in the expression of apoptosis-related genes.
