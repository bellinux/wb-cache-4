40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of several thinning agents in reducing fruit set in ‘Fuji ’ apple trees. The agents tested were NAD, ethephon, and BA. BA was sprayed at two different times during the <b>thinning</b> <b>period.</b> Multiple sprayings with various combinations of these agents were also evaluated. Ethephon applied alone was the only treatment which significantly increased fruit count at harvest time. None of the treatments had a significant affect on yield, mean fruit weight, the number of first class fruits, or the number of pygmy fruits. Ethephon applied alone was the only treatment which significantly increased the number of second class fruits. All BA alone applications slightly reduced final fruit number and increased mean fruit weight, both not significant. Also BA applied alone significantly reduced the number of second class fruits, regardless of which formulation was used or when it was applied.

40|$|Mesozoic epithermal gold {{deposits}} in eastern China {{are divided into}} calc-alkaline and alkaline magma-related gold deposits, and are also grouped as low-sulfidation, intermediate-sulfidation and high-sulfidation types, of which the first two predominate. These gold deposits are distributed in the Tianshan–Yinshan–Great Xing 2 ̆ 7 anling Variscan fold belt of North China craton, Qinling-Dabie Indo-Sinian fold belt of Yangtze craton, and South China fold belt or Cathaysian block, {{from north to south}} along the eastern China continent. Most of the epithermal gold orebodies are hosted either in volcanic rocks or their related granitoids, and volcanic breccia pipes. These orebodies are mainly associated with adularia–chalcedony–sericite, and alunite–kaolinite–quartz alteration. These orebodies formed in four mineralization pulses at 175, 145 – 135, 127 – 115, and 110 – 94 Ma. The first three pulses correspond to the post-collision period between the North China and Yangtze cratons, an extension period during late-stage rotation of the principal compressional stress from N-S to E-W, and a dramatic <b>thinning</b> <b>period</b> of the lithosphere, respectively.

The Timétrine lithologic {{succession}} includes from the base to the top Mesoproterozoic cratonic to passive margin formations overlain by deep-sea Fe-Mg schists. Submarine metabasalts and two ultramafic massifs of serpentinized mantle peridotites are inserted as olistoliths towards the top whereas turbidites of continental origin represent the younger unit. Field and petrological data have revealed a distinct metasedimentary sequence attached to the serpentinized peridotites. It essentially consists of impure carbonates, Fe jaspers and polymictic breccias containing altered blocks of mantle peridotites, most rocks being enriched in detrital chromite. This association is interpreted as reworked chemical and detrital sediments derived from the alteration of mafic-ultramafic rocks. It is argued that mantle exhumation above sea floor {{took place during the}} Neoproterozoic rifting and crustal <b>thinning</b> <b>period</b> under possible tropical conditions, as suggested by the large volume of silicified serpentinites. In spite of greenschist facies metamorphic overprint characterized by widespread Fe-rich blue amphiboles that are not diagnostic of high-pressure conditions, it is possible to reconstruct a former ocean-continent transition similar to that evidenced for the Mesozoic period, followed by the deposition of syn-to post rift terrigeneous turbidites roughly coeval with ocean spreading some time before 800 Ma. It is concluded that the serpentinite massifs were tectonically emplaced first in an extensional setting, then incorporated within deep-sea sediments as olistoliths and finally transported westward during late Neoproterozoic collisional tectonics onto the West African craton...|$|E

Five thinning treatments (A, B, C, D and I) with different intensity and frequency were under consideration. The model requires litter input to soil and climate data. Biomass of Norway spruce stands was estimated using tree height and tree diameter with Marklund biomass equations. Litter production was calculated by multiplying the compartment specific turnover rates with biomass. Climate data on temperature and precipitation were taken from closest weather points. The model was run for the total <b>thinning</b> <b>period</b> and at least six years later for each site with yearly litter input and climate data. The sensitivity of the model was checked by increasing and decreasing the temperature and precipitation by 20 %. Simulated mean values of SOC were used to assess the results. Total average and per year average difference in SOC between first and last year of simulations were calculated. General linear model was applied for statistical analysis. Simulated SOC stocks varied from 101 Mg ha- 1 to 161 Mg ha- 1 at eight sites. There was a tendency towards higher SOC at high site index locations. No clear trend was observed with respect to latitude of sites, stand age and basal area. Overall, thinning treatments had significant effect on SOC (p ≤ 0. 000). All thinning treatments negatively affected the SOC, except no thinning treatment (control, I), which had positive affect. One very heavy thinning treatment (C, 70 % basal area removal) had highest negative rate of change in SOC. This treatment was significantly different from all other treatments. Treatment A, B and D were normal to heavy in their intensity. These treatments also had negative rate of change in SOC, but were statistically similar.

40|$|Three {{applications}} of Smith's model of magneto-optical effects in stratified magnetic media are presented. Each application involves the incident-angle dependence of magneto-optical effects which Smith's model treats explicitly. In addition. the three applications address current issues in magnetic and magneto-optical recording. The first problem considered {{is that of}} nonmagnetic surface layers which form on magnetic recording heads. The second is a theoretical treatment of effects which arise in magneto-optical recording when high numerical-aperture optical systems are combined with media exhibiting interference-enhanced optical properties. The final application is a novel technique for determining the entire dielectric tensor of materials used for magneto-optical recording. The incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect is employed to study nonmagnetic surface layers which form on ferrite recording heads. Calculations based on the Smith model show a correlation between the inert-layer thickness and the incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect. Experimental results confirm the shift in the angular position of the signal peak. {{in agreement with the}} theory for finite inert-layer thickness. An unambiguous determination of the inert-layer thickness for ferrite materials is prevented because of a periodic dependence of the peak angle on the inert-layer thickness. Jones-matrix algebra is used with the Smith model to quantitatively determine the effects of obliquely-incident rays on the reflectance and magneto-optical readout signals for various magneto-optical media structures. The most antireflective structure is found to be very sensitive to incident-angle effects. Structures with moderate reflectance (> 10 %). however. are not significantly affected by incident-angle effects. Finally. a technique for the determination of the optical and magneto-optical constants from multiple incident-angle measurements of reflectance and Kerr rotation is presented. The experimental system employs a Helium-Neon laser and a rotating differential detection system. The technique is used to investigate the optical properties of a series of Cu/Co multilayers and a comparison with a model based on the bulk optical. constants of Cu and Co is made.

30|$|Abiotic {{factors such}} as {{humidity}} and solar insulation may represent stronger selective pressures on lichens than tree species, pushing lichen taxa to be more generalist {{in terms of their}} use of substrates (Gauslaa 2014). Some lichen species are known to depend on specific humidity levels for survival (Kantvilas and Minchin 1989), a condition that is altered by the removal of canopy trees as in a thinning. However, in this study, thinning in the absence of fire did not appear to result in meaningful changes in lichen diversity or cover.

Under the assumption that the pipe is much <b>thinner</b> than the <b>period,</b> a diffusion model that describes the pressure distribution and mass flux of the gas in each pipe element is derived, together with the connection conditions at the junctions of the narrow and wide pipes, from the kinetic system composed of the Boltzmann equation and its boundary condition on the pipe wall. Then, {{on the basis of the}} diffusion model and the connection conditions, a global diffusion model for the entire pipe is constructed by means of homogenization. The present work is a formal extension to the case of the Boltzmann equation of the previous work [K. Aoki and P. Degond, Multiscale Model. Simul. 1, 304 (2003) ], where a simplified version of the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) collision model is used. Some numerical results based on the original BGK model are also presented both for the global diffusion model and for the local diffusion model with the connection conditions at the junctions...|$|R
30|$|The recent {{advances}} in 3 -D EM modelling allow us to calculate the magnetic signatures of the ocean tides in high resolution and in the full complexity. However, various physical approximations still can provide significant reduction of computational time and/or memory requirements, which can be exploited, especially in the inversion scenarios. We have evaluated the effect of various traditional approximations. The predictions of the 2 -D approach match well with the 3 -D approach locally above deep oceans, or {{in the interpretation of}} low-orbit satellite data dealing with spherical harmonic degrees below 20. However, for accurate prediction of signals at the coastal and island geomagnetic observatories, or more generally, in the areas with significant variations of bathymetry and coastlines, full 3 -D calculations still may be required. This conclusion does not confirm the argument presented by Tyler (2017, Section  5.2) that the Earth oceans behave as an electrically <b>thin</b> sheet for <b>periods</b> above 10  min. Note that Tyler’s criterion is based on the penetration depth of magnetic field from the boundary. However, the imposed electric currents are distributed everywhere in the ocean volume and for tidal movements do not decrease significantly with depth.|$|R
5000|$|Following Bowie's Thin White Duke-period and the {{commercial}} {{success of the}} singles [...] "Fame" [...] and [...] "Golden Years" [...] in 1976, {{he was eager to}} escape the drug culture of Los Angeles, where he had developed a deleterious cocaine habit. Bowie had also become embroiled in controversy regarding comments he made seemingly in favor of fascism. He blamed his erratic behaviour around his <b>Thin</b> White Duke <b>period</b> on his addictions and precarious mental state, saying [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed." [...] He later called the period [...] "the darkest days of my life" [...] and confessed to not having any memory of the recording of Station to Station in Los Angeles in late 1975 due to his [...] "astronomic" [...] cocaine habit. As his drug habit ate away at his physical and mental health, Bowie attempted to reduce his cocaine intake and phase out the Thin White Duke persona, whom he had come to see as [...] "a nasty character indeed." [...] He further explained: [...] "It was a dangerous period for me. I {{was at the end of}} my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity." ...|$|R
