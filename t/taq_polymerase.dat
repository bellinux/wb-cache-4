Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E

Isolation of this protein from T. aquaticus is difficult leading to poor yield and quality. Several studies have shown the recombinant expression of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>Polymerase</b> in heterologous host cells. However, these still suffer from low yields. The use of T 7 RNA Polymerase regulated expression vector and availability of affinity tag (His-Tag) can make the expression of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>Polymerase</b> an efficient and economical process. The project is aimed at recombinant expression of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>Polymerase</b> in BL 21 host cell line and pET expression vector.

40|$|<b>Taq</b> DNA <b>{{polymerase}}</b> from Thermus aquaticus {{is used in}} the polymerase chain reaction. Not only is <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> highly {{valuable in}} the commercial market for the polymerase chain reaction but also important in studying DNA replication. In order to determine the crystal structure of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase,</b> it was necessary to use heavy atom multiple isomorphous replacement in addition to molecular replacement. The success of the multiple isomorphous replacement is often facilitated in a protein which has a reasonable number of cysteineshowever, wild type Taw DNA polymerase has no cysteines.

25|$|<b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> lacks a 3' to 5' {{exonuclease}} activity. Thus, Taq has no error-proof-reading activity, {{which consists}} of excision of any newly misincorporated nucleotide base from the nascent (i.e., extending) DNA strand that does not match with its opposite base in the complementary DNA strand. The lack in 3' to 5' proofreading of the Taq enzyme results in a high error rate (mutations per nucleotide per cycle) of approximately 1 in 10,000 bases, which affects the fidelity of the PCR, especially if errors occur early in the PCR with low amounts of starting material, causing accumulation of {{a large proportion of}} amplified DNA with incorrect sequence in the final product.|$|E
25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase.</b> In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E
2500|$|The use of <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> in PCR was {{announced}} by Henry Erlich {{at a meeting}} in Berlin on September 20, 1986, submitted for publication in October 1987, and was published early the next year'.

2500|$|In 1985 Norm Arnheim, also {{a member}} of the {{development}} team, concluded his sabbatical at Cetus and assumed an academic position at USC. [...] He began to investigate the use of PCR to amplifiy samples containing just a single copy of the target sequence. [...] By 1989 his lab developed multiplex-PCR on single sperm to directly analyze the products of meiotic recombination.

2500|$|The {{commercial}} use of enzymes from T. aquaticus {{has not been}} without controversy. After Dr. Brock's studies, samples of the organism were deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, a public repository. Other scientists, including those at Cetus, obtained it from there. As the commercial potential of <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> became apparent in the 1990s, the National Park Service labeled its use as the [...] "Great Taq Rip-off".

2500|$|Once colonies are selected, transformants are genotyped using allele {{specific}} PCR. In this process, a mutant PCR primer is used {{to select}} for the mutant over the wild-type genotype. If the mutant genotype is present, it anneals to the 3’ end of the PCR primer while the wild-type genotype results in mismatched DNA at the 3’ end. The mismatch between the 3’ end of the primer and wild-type prevents primer extension and thus, only the mutant genotype produces a PCR product. Hotstart <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> lacking 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity was used for colony PCR of the putative mutants.|$|E

5000|$|Pfu DNA {{polymerase}} has superior thermostability and proofreading properties {{compared to}} <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase.</b> Unlike <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase,</b> Pfu DNA polymerase possesses 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity, meaning {{that as the}} DNA is assembled from the 5' end to 3' end, the exonuclease activity immediately removes nucleotides misincorporated at the 3' end of the growing DNA strand. Consequently, Pfu DNA polymerase-generated PCR fragments will have fewer errors than Taq-generated PCR inserts.|$|R
50|$|The insert {{is created}} by PCR using <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>{{polymerase}}.</b> This polymerase lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and, with a high probability, adds a single, 3'-adenine overhang to {{each end of the}} PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have guanines at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> adding the terminal adenosine overhang. Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3´ to 5´ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3´ adenine-overhangs.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{early in}} 1985, the group began using a {{thermostable}} DNA polymerase (the enzyme {{used in the}} original reaction is destroyed at each heating step). [...] At the time only two had been described, from Taq and Bst. [...] The report on <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing. [...] The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR. [...] That summer Mullis attempted to isolate the enzyme, and a group outside of Cetus was contracted to make it, all without success. [...] In the Fall of 1985 Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{polymerase}} {{was first}} isolated from T. aquaticus in 1976. The first advantage found for this thermostable (temperature optimum 80°C) DNA polymerase {{was that it}} could be isolated in a purer form (free of other enzyme contaminants) than could the DNA polymerase from other sources. Later, Kary Mullis and other investigators at Cetus Corporation discovered this enzyme could be used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process for amplifying short segments of DNA, eliminating the need to add enzyme after every cycle of thermal denaturation of the DNA. The enzyme was also cloned, sequenced, modified (to produce the shorter 'Stoffel fragment'), and produced in large quantities for commercial sale. In 1989 Science magazine named <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> as its first [...] "Molecule of the Year". In 1993, Dr. Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work with PCR.|$|E
2500|$|Magnesium is {{required}} as a co-factor for thermostable DNA polymerase. <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> is a magnesium-dependent enzyme and determining the optimum concentration to use {{is critical to}} the success of the PCR reaction. Some of the components of the reaction mixture such as template concentration, dNTPs and the presence of chelating agents (EDTA) or proteins can reduce the amount of free magnesium present thus reducing the activity of the enzyme. Primers which bind to incorrect template sites are stabilized in the presence of excessive magnesium concentrations and so results in decreased specificity of the reaction. Excessive magnesium concentrations also stabilize double stranded DNA and prevent complete denaturation of the DNA during PCR reducing the product yield. Inadequate thawing of MgCl2 may result in the formation of concentration gradients within the magnesium chloride solution supplied with the DNA polymerase and also contributes to many failed experiments [...]|$|E

40|$|The full {{potential}} of diagnostic PCR is limited, in part, {{by the presence}} of inhibitors in complex biological samples that reduce the amplification efficiency. Therefore, different pre-PCR treatments are being used to reduce the effects of PCR inhibitors. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of 16 amplification facilitators to enhance DNA amplification in the presence of blood, feces, or meat. Different concentrations of amplification facilitators and inhibitory samples were added to PCR mixtures containing rTth or <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase.</b> The addition of 0. 6 % (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin to reaction mixtures containing <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> reduced the inhibitory effect of blood and allowed DNA amplification in the presence of 2 % instead of 0. 2 % (vol/vol) blood. Furthermore, the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to reaction mixtures containing feces or meat enhanced the amplification capacities of both <b>polymerases.</b> <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> was able to amplify DNA in the presence of 4 % instead of 0. 4 % (vol/vol) feces and 4 % instead of 0. 2 % (vol/vol) meat, and rTth was able to amplify DNA in the presence of 4 % instead of 0. 4 % (vol/vol) feces and 20 % instead of 2 % (vol/vol) meat. The single-stranded DNA binding T 4 gene 32 protein (gp 32) had a relieving effect similar to that of BSA, except when it was added to PCR mixtures of rTth containing meat and of <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> containing feces. The relieving effects of betaine and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors were more sample specific. The addition of 11. 7 % (wt/vol) betaine allowed <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> to amplify DNA in the presence of 2 % (vol/vol) blood, while the addition of proteinase inhibitors allowed DNA amplification by both polymerases in the presence of 4 % (vol/vol) feces. When various combinations of betaine, BSA, gp 32, and proteinase inhibitors were tested, no synergistic or additive effects were observed.

2500|$|Microbes are {{ideally suited}} for {{biochemical}} and genetics studies {{and have made}} huge contributions to these fields of science such as the demonstration that DNA is the genetic material, that the gene has a simple linear structure, that the genetic code is a triplet code, and that gene expression is regulated by specific genetic processes.

2500|$|Extension/elongation: The {{temperature}} at this step {{depends on the}} DNA polymerase used; the optimum activity temperature for <b>Taq</b> <b>polymerase</b> is approximately , though a temperature of [...] is commonly used with this enzyme. In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that are complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, condensing the 5'-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3'-hydroxy group {{at the end of}} the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their optimal temperature, most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled. With each successive cycle, the original template strands plus all newly generated strands become template strands for the next round of elongation, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA target region.|$|E

To achieve the highest efficiency, different concentrations of primer and <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase</b> and also a variety of PGR program cycles were tested. After achieving the optimal concentration of the DOP primer and <b>Taq</b> DNA <b>polymerase,</b> two different protocols were investigated.
