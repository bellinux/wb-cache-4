New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has [...] "the most aggressive" [...] astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.

In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling {{said that if the}} reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to determine the levels <b>of</b> <b>using</b> strategic management tools (SMT) and satisfaction with them in five star hotels in Turkey. In addition, the relationships between the characteristics of managers and organizations in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the SMT and satisfaction with term are investigated. The sample includes 53 five-star hotels in Turkey. Results show that the levels <b>of</b> <b>using</b> SMT are high, but satisfactions with them are low. While the tool with the highest usage is customer relationship management, the tool with the lowest usage is Hoshin Kanri. On the other hand, while the SMT of Swot Analysis has highest satisfaction scores, the Search conference has lowest. Thus, a matrix of the levels <b>of</b> <b>using</b> SMT and satisfaction with term is presented. In this study, significant differences among organizations’ operation years and their decision making levels in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> SMT are determined.
