Granger causality tests indicate a causal flow from <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> to Iowa-Southern Minnesota prices before MPR and a causal reversal after MPR enactment.

Among many possible reasons for spatial concentration, I study here {{the effects of}} the distribution of end users and <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> on acreage allocation. The presence of multiple <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> in a growing area may allow for a more flexible marketing plan, along with introducing more idiosyncratic demand uncertainty associated with each consumption point. To take better advantage of future marketing opportunities, growers, depending on their location relative to <b>terminal</b> <b>markets,</b> may adjust the crop mix produced on the farm. I characterize the types of environments that lead to a spatial production concentration of a commodity in a growing area. I also analyze the equilibrium effects of an increase in transportation costs and a shift in acreage available for planting on spatial acreage allocation. commodity prices, location, marketing, production concentration, supermodularity, systematic risk. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the turmoil}} {{brought on by}} the {{depression}} and new competition, the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> remained afloat during the 1930s. By some accounts, the market did rather well. According to George H. Eltien, then superintendent, the market was shipping phone orders to 38 states, Canada, and Mexico throughout the decade. Pressure from supermarkets was not hurting all of the merchants. Ten of the market's 64 merchants had been there since its founding in 1892. In 1930, the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> Merchants Association established as an effort to promote and advertise the market and avoid losing any more business. The Association was responsible for several promotional events including the first annual Food Show and Home Progress Exhibitions. It also helped to fund a 1934 renovation of the market's facade that installed new electric lights and window decorations.|$|E

50|$|The {{supply of}} gold is {{provided}} by mining, official sales (typically gold by central banks), de-hedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on <b>terminal</b> <b>markets)</b> and old gold scraps. The total world supply of gold in 2007 was 3,497 tonnes. Gold production (mining) {{does not need to}} make up for gold demand because gold is a reusable resource. Currently, yearly gold mining produces 2% of the existing above-ground gold which is 158,000 tonnes (as of 2006). In 2008, gold mining produced 2,400 tonnes of gold, official gold sales close to 300 tonnes, and dehedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on <b>terminal</b> <b>markets)</b> close to 500 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|America's {{involvement}} in World War II during the 1940s affected the Market primarily {{in a positive}} way. In 1944, the most economically straining year of the war, the Market was at 97 percent occupancy. Food shortages {{brought on by the}} war increased the demand for the market's goods. On May 9, 1946, the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> experienced its largest recorded crowd. Over 12,000 people gathered at the market to purchase meat, poultry, and pork products that were unavailable elsewhere due to shortages.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{location}} {{was occupied by}} an open-air market {{that had been in}} continuous operation since 1853. After loud complaints and much negotiation, the railroad agreed to purchase the markets for $1million and move them to a new structure: the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market,</b> located to the rear (north) of the headhouse at 12th and Filbert Streets. This required the trainshed and all of its tracks to be constructed one story above street level, with the Ninth Street Branch to bring trains in and out.|$|E
25|$|In {{its first}} few decades, the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> was a success. There were 380 merchants {{in its first}} year of operations, and the market had nearly full {{occupancy}} for the following 60 years. Business, already good, flourished with the innovation of a free market basket service, which allowed suburban housewives to get grocery orders delivered to and held at their nearest train station. Refrigerated trucks allowed the market to reach into some 60 suburban towns as well as seaside resorts along the New Jersey shore.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression of the 1930s brought {{hardship}} to the market. By {{the late}} 1930s, merchants were under increasing {{pressure from the}} AFL and CIO to join their respective labor unions. This led {{to a series of}} strikes that further disrupted business. The introduction and proliferation of supermarkets also hurt market business during the 1930s. One of these new establishments opened across 12th street, directly competing with the Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market.</b> Pressure to compete with supermarkets led to fewer stalls being run by farmers, and more being run by middle men reselling a variety of goods.|$|E
25|$|Open-air {{markets have}} flourished in Philadelphia since its founding. Growth {{of the city}} demanded more markets, and the string of open-air markets {{extending}} from the Delaware River ran for six blocks, or one full mile, prompting the main street (then called 'High Street') to be renamed 'Market Street' in 1858. Soon after the markets reached their peak growth and capacity, the public began to perceive open-air markets within the city as dirty and unhygienic. Some residents also considered the frenzy of activity along the High/Market Street as a nuisance and traffic hazard. In 1859, city officials bowed to public pressure and dismantled all of them and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered seventeen different market companies. This prompted two indoor markets to open at 12th and Market Streets, Franklin Market and Farmers' Market. These two would be {{the foundation of the}} Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{present day}} market has also {{continued}} to evolve {{in terms of}} the types of merchants that have their businesses in the market; it has shifted from being a place with only produce, delis and fish counters to a more dynamic merchant selection. In addition to longstanding vendors such as Bassett’s Ice Cream—which first signed a lease at Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> in 1893—the market has innovated in recent years, introducing new types of vendors and experimenting with pop-up food carts. In addition to mainstays such as butchers and fishmongers, the market is home to the non-profit Fair Food Philly’s market stand, a gourmet corn-dog vendor, a winery, and a beer hall. Day-carts—which have typically housed the wares of souvenir sellers and arts and crafts vendors—now may sell foods and beverages. One of the newest vendors to operate a day-cart is a craft distiller of spirits.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s the Reading Company {{changed its}} {{attitude}} towards the market and began efforts to revitalize it. Those efforts continued after SEPTA Regional Rail trains moved from the train terminal above the market to the new underground Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) below it in 1984. In 1990, ownership of the Reading Terminal and the market passed to the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority (PCCA), and in 1994, Philadelphia City Council established a new, non-profit Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> Corporation (RTMC) to operate the market. The RTMC and the PCCA continued the revitalization program begun by the Reading Company, recruiting new tenants and increasing promotion of the market. By the mid-1990s to the 2000s, the market was once again living up to its founder's' vision. Over 90% of its leasable space was occupied by profitable and stable vendors. The market is currently open 7 days a week, but not all vendors are open on Sundays. The Pennsylvania Dutch vendors are open Wednesday through Saturday.|$|E
25|$|Reading <b>Terminal</b> <b>Market</b> (pronounced RED-ing /ˈrɛdɪŋ/) is an {{enclosed}} public market located at 12th and Arch Streets in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It opened originally in 1893 under the elevated train shed of the Reading Railroad Company {{after the city}} of Philadelphia advocated to move public markets from the streets into indoor facilities for both safety and sanitary reasons.The Reading Railroad Company owned and operated the market space until 1976 when the company liquidated, leaving the market without its parent company and foot traffic from the train. Presently, it still occupies the ground floor and basement levels of the Reading Terminal's former train shed which {{is now part of}} the Philadelphia Convention Center. Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods. Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s. The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art refrigerated storage area for vendor use. Currently, the market is open {{every day of the week}} although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday.|$|E

For example, New Delhi serves as a distribution centre to the south of India for apples grown in the Himalayan foothills. The problems of <b>terminal</b> wholesale <b>markets</b> are usually ones of congestion caused by an unsuitable location or by an inappropriate mixture of wholesale and retail functions. Traditionally, wholesale markets were built adjacent to city centres, located at a focal point of the inter-city transport facilities and close to the main retailing areas.
