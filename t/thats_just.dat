60|$|SYKES [pointing to the {{simmering}} Reginald and {{the boiling}} General] <b>Thats</b> <b>just</b> it, Bishop. Edith is her uncle's niece. She cant control herself {{any more than}} they can. And she's a Bishop's daughter. That means that she's engaged in social work of all sorts: organizing shop assistants and sweated work girls and all that. When her blood boils about it (and it boils at least once a week) she doesnt care what she says.|$|E

Its likely indeed Id frighten the man off with any such nonsense, at my age. What? (She listens.) Well, <b>thats</b> <b>just</b> what I was thinkin.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. I {{can imagine}} {{all sorts of}} men I could {{fall in love with}}; but I never seem to meet them. The real ones are too small, like Bunny, or too silly, like Jerry. Of course one can get into a state about any man: fall in love with him if you like to call it that. But who would risk marrying a man for love? I shouldnt. I {{remember}} three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never marry was the man you were in love with, because it would make a perfect slave of you. Theres a sort of instinct against it, I think, <b>thats</b> <b>just</b> as strong as the other instinct. One of them, to my certain knowledge, refused a man she was in love with, and married another who was in love with her; and it turned out very well.|$|E

60|$|THE MAN. No. <b>Thats</b> <b>just</b> it: Ive no {{business}} to do. Do {{you know what}} my life is? I spend my days from nine to six--nine hours of daylight and fresh air--in a stuffy little den counting another man's money. Ive an intellect: a mind and a brain and a soul; and the use he makes of them is to fix them on his tuppences and his eighteenpences and his two pound seventeen and tenpences and see how much they come to {{at the end of}} the day and take care that no one steals them. I enter and enter, and add and add, and take money and give change, and fill cheques and stamp receipts; and not a penny of that money is my own: not one of those transactions has the smallest interest for me or anyone else in the world but him; and even he couldnt stand it if he had to do it all himself. And I'm envied: aye, envied for the variety and liveliness of my job, by the poor devil of a bookkeeper that has to copy all my entries over again. Fifty thousand entries a year that poor wretch makes; and not ten out of the fifty thousand ever has to be referred to again; and when all the figures are counted up and the balance sheet made out, the boss isnt a penny the richer than he'd be if bookkeeping had never been invented. Of all the damnable waste of human life that ever was invented, clerking is the very worst.|$|E
