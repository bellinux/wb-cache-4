5|$|White {{was handed}} the number34 {{guernsey}} at Fremantle {{and he wore}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} career. He credits Percy Johnson with guiding his ruck style in his time with Fremantle. He played 32games and kicked 18 goals with the Dockers between 1995 and 1997, before being traded back to his home state of Victoria to play for Melbourne. Salary-cap breaches involved in White's trade caused Melbourne to forfeit their highest selection (pick number 5) in the 1999 draft to Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Weylandt's death, Giro {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would not issue his dossard number 108 in future editions of the race. His number was a prominent part of signs held by fans on the roadside at not just the Giro but other events later in the season as well, including the Tour of California where his death was part of the reason the first stage of that race was canceled due to safety concerns. Many other races, mostly those held in Weylandt's native Belgium, also began the practice of not issuing the number. The Belgian federation criticized this gesture, saying it would not bring Weylandt back and would only serve to continually remind fans and those in the sport of Weylandt's death. They issued <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> the Belgian national road race championships.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 2014, UCLA {{announced}} that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him. The only sport this did not affect was men's basketball, which had previously retired <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that sport to wear 42, with Hazzard's blessing). In a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three athletes (in women's soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues.|$|E

5|$|The M-120 {{designation}} {{was originally}} used {{on two different}} roadways in the state. In 1930, a road from US16 for about a mile at {{the northwest corner of}} Lansing was numbered M-120. In early 1939, the M-174 designation replaced the M-120 moniker on the road. Later that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) used <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> a road along the Michigan-Ohio state line. This highway connected to State Route 120 on its east end at the state line and ran west to US127 at Meridian Road along the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line. By the end of 1940, M-120 was extended through Hillsdale County to connect to State Road 120 along the short north–south Michigan–Indiana border. By the middle of 1961, the M-120 designation was retired by the MSHD again. The Ohio and Indiana SR120 highways are still in place today with only the county road in Michigan connecting them.|$|E
5|$|There {{is still}} a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books {{have been written about}} him. The number 27, the number of his Ferrari in 1981 and 1982, is still closely {{associated}} with him by fans. Jean Alesi, whose aggression and speed in the wet were compared to Villeneuve's, also used the number at Ferrari. Villeneuve's son, Jacques, drove the #27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> occasional drives in NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing).|$|E

25|$|The two's {{complement}} {{of the minimum}} number in the range {{will not have the}} desired effect of negating <b>the</b> <b>number.</b> <b>For</b> example, the two's {{complement of}} −128 in an 8-bit system results in the same binary number.

25|$|Special rules apply as {{two teams}} {{will have the}} same number. The fastest lap time in {{qualifying}} determines which team will have <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> the race, and which team must temporarily change <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> the race. For example, during the 1991 Busch Series season, there were selected races in the Northeast (Loudon, Nazareth, Dover, Oxford) where both the Busch Grand National (now Xfinity) and Busch Grand National North (now K Pro East) Series raced in combination races. North team Ricky Craven (also drove his car) and Grand National team Don Beverly Racing (Jimmy Hensley driving) both used No. 25. Whoever had the faster qualifying time in each race used No. 25. Craven used No. 28 at Oxford when Hensley had the faster time, while Hensley used No. 5 when Craven had the faster time at Loudon. Both teams, however, scored respective owner points for the No. 25 in their respective series.|$|E

25|$|An ASL prefix, (touching the chin), is {{used with}} number signs to {{indicate}} 'years old'.
