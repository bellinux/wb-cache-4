5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E

5|$|Although Allied {{casualties}} {{during the}} battle had been light, {{in the wake of}} the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> malaria dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed. After this, <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> malaria amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> {{clinical}} mastitis were studied in 274 Dutch dairy herds. Variables that {{were associated with}} resistance to disease were the feeding, housing, and milking machine factors. Variables that were associated with exposure were grazing, combined housing of dry cows and heifers, and calving area hygiene. Postmilking teat disinfection in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and years of practicing dry cow therapy were positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis. Herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and in which postmilking teat disinfection was not used had lower <b>incidence</b> rates <b>of</b> clinical mastitis than did other herds. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli was mostly related to housing conditions, hygiene, and machine milking. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was mostly related to factors associated with bulk milk somatic cell count and factors that {{might be due to}} cause and effect reversal. A strong positive correlation existed between <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae and <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Staph. aureus. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae was related to nutrition, milking technique, and machine milking. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>of</b> clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis was associated with factors related to housing, nutrition, and machine milking.

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
