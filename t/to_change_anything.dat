For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design {{elements}} from the first game, as they {{felt that there was}} no need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon {{them in a way that}} retained the base style of Knights of the Old Republic. Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes. Knights of the Old Republic IIs lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through [...] "tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels", and he said that he was pleased with the amount of people who wanted to work for Obsidian.

The script was 27 pages long, instead of the normal average of about 65, {{due to lack of}} stage directions. Clive Arnold was asked to direct the episode, and was allowed to input more into the script than would be normal, which he said was due to his good working {{relationship}} with Jordan. Jordan also gave Brown the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> she wanted to. Arnold was careful that the episode would not alienate regular EastEnders viewers by making it too left of field, ensuring that it would be recognisable as an EastEnders episode, and made sure viewers would identify with the character, emphasising her state of mind with visual links. Brown found her lines for the episode easy to learn as they [...] "flowed" [...] and the script was well written. Arnold and Brown worked closely together, rehearsing and working on the script in detail. Rehearsals went on for a number of weeks and after being able to judge the pace of the episode, Arnold was able to introduce choreography and stage directions. He stated that the rehearsals were invaluable as he, Brown and Jordan could work together to develop and tweak the script as they progressed. He broke the script down into scenes to aid Brown's performance by giving her one scene to concentrate on per day of filming.|$|E

Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in Dragon Quest III, and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two Dragon Quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record [...] Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, {{which turned out to be}} unworkable during Dragon Quest IIIs development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in Mirai Shinwa Jarvas, but Horii's team was too far into development <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>anything.</b> Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, [...] "Leave him to us!

In various strips minus has climbed into paintings and chalk drawings, brought inanimate objects to life, killed out of spite, turned a library into a pirate ship, become the ruler of a colony of ants, swum with mermaids in her bathtub and pulled the plug when she was done, and various other fantastical situations.|$|R

500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>anything,</b> unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the moral {{imagination}} of Kurt Vonnegut and attempt to determine its philosophical basis. This topic was previously only mentioned briefly in the course of other studies, and no one had ever attempted to examine the scope of Vonnegut’s moral vision. This moral vision was examined within the categories of government, technology, violence, economics, and religion. It was concluded that Vonnegut’s vision is based upon the philosophy of humanism: Man is sacred and must be preserved. To this end, Vonnegut advocates a more democratic and selfless form of government, the deemphasis of technology, a more moral scientific responsibility, global pacifism, a socialist economic system, a new religion based on humanism which emphasizes love for all people, and, finally, a return to large extended families. Although Vonnegut acknowledges that this moral vision is unlikely to be instituted on a large enough scale <b>to</b> really <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> due <b>to</b> complexity of an absurd, mechanized, and dehumanized society, he believes it is the moral responsibility of every individual to attempt it.

It appears that students used KPE mostly for managing and sharing project documentation; and that task was usually delegated to one team member.

On the other hand, the flexibility of the KPE, especially the possibility for all team members <b>to</b> edit and <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> openly might also be a challenge; it requires systematic organization of materials.
