5|$|The {{middle finger}} gesture {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b> These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

But when the Muawwidhatayn were revealed, he used them (for protection) and abandoned all else besides them. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisai and ibn Majah recorded this.|$|R

Black Sabbath grossed 103.5 million Italian lira on its initial theatrical release in Italy. American International Pictures released the English version of Black Sabbath in May 6, 1964 as a double bill with Bava's The Girl Who Knew Too Much then titled <b>The</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>Eye.</b> The English title of Black Sabbath was chosen to connect it with Bava's previous film Black Sunday. The film opened in France on 17 November 1965 under the title Les trois visages de la peur.|$|E
25|$|The protections against Gellou, as an {{embodiment}} of envy, resemble those against <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b> One exorcism text dating {{from around the}} turn of the 19th–20th century gives Baskania as a name for the gello as well as for <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Khamsa, {{an ancient}} symbol {{shaped like a}} hand with four fingers and one thumb, {{is used as a}} {{protective}} amulet by Jews; that same symbol is also very popular in Arabic culture, known to protect from envy and <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2001, while {{deployed}} {{with the}} 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit(SOC), <b>the</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>Eyes</b> of HMM-163 again {{had the opportunity}} to serve America with distinction by participating in combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While forward deployed to the Central Command Theater of Operations, <b>the</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>Eyes</b> planned and executed the longest amphibious assault in American military history with the seizure of a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in southern Afghanistan. This was accomplished {{through the use of a}} 4-aircraft detachment of CH-53E helicopters, which are capable of in-flight refueling. They had been attached to the squadron 8 months earlier in preparation for deployment as the Air Combat Element of the 15th MEU (SOC). The squadron remained forward deployed for seven weeks operating from the austere base in support of Task Force 58 and other coalition Special Operations Forces.|$|R

50|$|The patronal feasts are {{celebrated on}} 26 and 27 July {{in honour of}} {{the patron saint of}} the village Santa Ana, or Santiña as the locals call it.

25|$|Another {{similarity}} between the Silmarillion and the Lebor Gabála Érenn {{can be seen by}} comparing Nuada and Lugh (who possessed a famed magic spear, the Spear Luin) and the outcome of their respective confrontations against Balor of <b>the</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>Eye</b> with the events surrounding Celebrimbor and Gil-galad (whose weapon is the spear Aeglos) and their conflicts with Sauron of the Lidless Red Eye in the Second Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} of the Talmud {{seem to be}} particularly influenced by popular conception {{in the direction of}} folk medicine. A belief in <b>the</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>eye</b> was also prevalent in Talmudic times, and occasionally omens were taken seriously, though in some cases recognized as being merely popular beliefs. Thus, while it is declared to be unlucky to do things twice, as eating, drinking, or washing, Rabbi Dunai recognized that this was an old tradition.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>Eyes</b> {{deployed}} from August 22, 2003 to March 8, 2004 {{with the}} 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Again, the squadron made history by {{being part of}} the first Expeditionary Strike Group One (ESG-1). The ESG concept focused on combining surface action groups and submarines with traditional Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs) and MEUs to offer theater combatant commanders more flexibility and capabilities. During this deployment HMM-163 participated in security operation in the southern Iraqi city of Basrah in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.|$|R

5000|$|It is now {{accepted}} that Malik Altunia {{was her first}} and last love. The rumors of Yaqut were only spread by Turkish nobles to put the Sultana's image down. Many well known historians also believe that the rebellion was simply {{a way of getting}} her back and to protect her from <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eyes</b> of people like Kabir Khan and the Turkish Nobles who always wanted her downfall because they could not accept a woman sitting on the throne. Mount Elphiston describes Malik Altunia in his book as [...] "the safest hands Sultan Razia could ever be placed in." ...|$|R
25|$|Divination, {{and magic}} in Islam, {{encompass}} {{a wide range}} of practices, including black magic, warding off <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye,</b> the production of amulets and other magical equipment, evocation, casting lots, and astrology. Muslims do commonly believe in magic (sihr) and explicitly forbid its practice. Sihr translates from Arabic as sorcery or black magic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is surah al-Falaq of the Qur'an, which is known as a prayer to God to ward off black magic.|$|E

25|$|During his {{childhood}} Caine was occasionally sent {{to stay with}} his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at Ballaugh on the Isle of Man.

25|$|However, in some communities, the ketubah {{is either}} {{displayed}} in a very private section of the home or is not displayed at all. Various reasons given for this include {{the fact that the}} details specify personal details, prominent display may invite jealousy or fears of <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b> Historically, the ketubah specified whether the bride was a virgin. In Sephardic communities, it still specifies the actual contributions of the family to the new household and the divorce settlement; Ashkenazi communities have adopted the custom of having set amounts for all weddings.|$|E
25|$|Levana {{lifts the}} baby, who was ceremonially {{placed on the}} ground after birth in {{symbolic}} contact with Mother Earth.

The midwife then cut the umbilical cord and presented the newborn to the mother, a scene sometimes depicted on sarcophagi. A grandmother or maternal aunt next cradled the infant in her arms; with a finger covered in lustral saliva, she massaged the baby's forehead and lips, a gesture meant to ward off <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

25|$|The witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an {{organized}} effort by authorities {{in many countries}} to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to Christendom. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must {{be separated from the}} belief in witches, <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>eye,</b> and other such phenomena, which are common features of folk belief worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized in a powerful but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt.|$|E
