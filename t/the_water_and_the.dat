5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings. Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quality of the aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed {{to the base of the}} lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E

5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations. Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS water Dam {{and it is very}} mesmerising to be there and watch the sunset and sunrise. The colour of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study with the late ashtanga yoga guru K. Pattabhi Jois.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E

5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took {{the place of the}} reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
