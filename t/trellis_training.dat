40|$|The varietal {{character}} of wine deriving from non-aromatic grapes originate {{mainly from the}} transformation of odourless precursors, such as glycosidically bound volatile compounds, into odour-active compounds during winemaking. The use of several training systems involves changes in different conditions including exposure to light, intervine distance and vine density. All these factors affect the content of vine metabolites, including the ones that constitute the volatile profile of grape. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of different training systems such as little tree, trellis, and four rays training, on the volatile composition of Primitivo grape and the corresponding wine in Apulia region. Free and bound volatile fractions have been evaluated by gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results have shown that little tree and <b>trellis</b> <b>training</b> sistems improve the accumulation of aroma precursors and volatile compounds in grape and wine.

40|$|Consistency {{of fruit}} quality is {{extremely}} important in horticulture. Fruit growth and quality in nectarine are affected by fruit position in the canopy, related to the tree shape. The “open shaped” training systems, such as Tatura Trellis, improve fruit growth and quality. The Index of Absorbance Difference (IAD) is a new marker that characterizes climacteric fruit during ripening. A study on fruit ripening was performed by using the IAD on nectarine to monitor fruit maturity stages of two cultivars trained as Tatura Trellis in Victoria, Australia. Fruit of cv “Summer Flare 34 ” (“SF 34 ”) grown in different positions on the tree showed high ripening homogeneity. Fruit harvested at a similar ripening stage showed fruit firmness and soluble solid content homogeneity. Fruits from hand-thinned variety “Summer Flare 26 ” (“SF 26 ”) were larger in size, had advanced ripening, and showed greater homogeneity. For “SF 26 ”, a weak correlation between IAD and SSC was observed. The experiment showed that the Tatura <b>Trellis</b> <b>training</b> system is characterized by high homogeneity of nectarine fruit when coupled with a proper management of fruit density. It also confirmed that the IAD {{could be used as}} new nondestructive maturity index for nectarine fruit quality assessment in the field...|$|E

40|$|When a leaf was {{considered}} to be a flat plate, distributions of leaf inclination angle in the fruit tree canopies were approximated to a beta distribution. Many varieties of apple and pear, and a part of Japanese pear belonged to strongly horizontal type. A part of peach and cherry belonged to vertical type, and other varieties belonged to weak horizontal, intermediate and iso-angular types. There was no strong erect type. By monthly investigation of the distribution at an almost same portion in a tree crown, seasonal variation was not so distinguished. Methods for measurement of distribution of surface inclination angle on non-flat leaf were devised using the wire-frame diagrams, which were obtained by a stereo-photogrammetry. Rotation of the wire-frame diagram was effective using rotation angles which were obtained by simple measuring of inclination angle of both mid-rib line of each leaf and a perpendicular line to the mid-rib. In the many fruit varieties, the curvature increased in May and surmmertime (July and August), and decreased in June and September. In apple (especially, central leader) and persimmon, the horizontal type was found at the upper canopy layers, and the weak horizontal type and the intermediate one were found at the mid-layers and the lowers. In peach, change of the distribution by the height was little. Horizontal type became strong in the upper part of pear and Japanese pear with <b>trellis</b> <b>training,</b> where summer pruning was lacking. From these results, inclination angles of current shoots seemed to be a main factor for intra-crown fluctuation of leaf inclination angle.

40|$|Summary : For {{the purpose}} of {{development}} of possible fruit tree crowns for reducing pesticide use, a facility of computing a value of tree crown surface area/tree crown volume (S-V ratio) {{was added to the}} previous system (Canopy Constructing and Analyzing System of fruit tree, CACOAS). In addition, another simulation model for distribution of pesticide deposits within a tree crown was constructed by using nonrandom leaf densities from CACOAS. The two simulations were carried out over 20 years for 154 pear tree forms, which were constructed by combining several arrangements of skeleton branches with five tree form groups under constraint condition of identical yearly orchard LAI by CACOAS. The S-V ratios resulted in the following relations; slender central leader＞trellis training＞Y shape＞open center≒modified central leader. In a spray system using a nozzle, slim tree crowns as slender central leader or <b>trellis</b> <b>training</b> seemed to be advantageous to reduce pesticide use. As results from the pesticide deposit simulation, the drift proportions were very high and over about 60 %, even if they were estimated at lowest. In order to correct the excessive deposit, the simulation results were standardized using a practical deposit level. As the result, large differences appeared in the mean values for 20 years of yearly spray volume per 10 a of land area within the 154 tree forms, and the minimum value was about 40 % of the maximum. There was a positive correlation between mean spray volumes for 20 years after the standardization and each of tree height, volume under tree crown and leaf density. Conversely, there was a negative correlation between mean spray volumes and each of East-West tree width, inside void space, canopy volume, tree crown volume and land area occupied by tree crown. There was a positive correlation between mean deposits for 20 years before the standardization and each of outside void space, canopy volume, tree crown volume and land area occupied by tree crown. A negative correlation was found between the mean deposit and space volume under tree crown or leaf density, and not found against tree height. 　　Key Words : nonrandom distribution of leaf densities, pear, reducing pesticide use, simulation system by a computer, tree form　　キーワード：葉密度の非ランダム分布，セイヨウナシ，減農薬，コンピュータによるシミュレーション，樹...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In 1960 {{tests were}} {{initiated}} on the Marion blackberry (Rubus hybrid) {{to study the}} effect of (1) plant spacing, (2) time of training canes to the trellis and (3) amount of cane to train to the trellis with regard to fruit bud formation and total yield. Plant spacing varied with 2. 5, 5 and 10 feet between plants in the row. Time of training the canes to the trellis was approximately {{the middle of the}} months of August, September, October and February. The amount of cane trained on the trellis was either the entire length of all sound canes or only enough of each cane to reach the adjacent plant. Total yield of fruit, fruit spur determinations, time of fruit bud formation, leaf size and number and carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves were studied and/or measured. Although yield differences were greatest {{in the early years of}} the planting, 4 -year averages indicate that closer spacing of plants resulted in highly significant increases. August-trained canes produced the highest yields, followed in order by February, September and October. Differences in yield between the length of canes trained were very small and generally non-significant. When more cane grox<rth was trained, a corresponding increase in training time was required, particularly at the closer plant spacings. August and September training of canes stimulated the axillary buds to elongate and produce lateral growth. These laterals on August-trained canes matured enough to allow the formation of fruit buds, while laterals on September-trained canes were generally too succulent to form fruit buds. August-trained canes produced more fruit spurs per foot of row than February-trained canes. No difference in number of flower buds per fruit spur occurred between August and February training. Leaf counts on November 1 indicated that <b>trellis</b> <b>training</b> done in August produced more trifoliate leaves per foot of row than when the canes remained on the ground. Trifoliate leaves from ground-level training were larger. Axillary buds were collected at 2 -week intervals starting on August 1 and continuing until November 15 for the purpose of determining the time of fruit bud formation. The canes were divided into three sections, (1) basal, (2) mid-and (3) terminal, and each sampled separately. Buds from trellis-level training changed little during August and September; however, on October 2, buds from the terminal area only of canes and laterals were showing elongation. By mid-October, buds from all areas of the cane were showing an elongation of the apex. The first and only floral structure, expressed as a broadening and flattening of the apex, was observed in terminal section buds sampled on November 15. In contrast, basal and mid-section buds from canes trained along the ground during the summer showed an elongation of the apex by October 2, and by November 15 well defined floral structures were observed. Buds from the terminal section of cane were beginning to show some elongation by mid-November. Carbohydrate and nitrogen determinations were made on trifoliate leaves sampled from various loci on the canes on November 1. Older leaves, regardless of plant spacing or time of training, had the lowest nitrogen content. Carbohydrate content of leaves was quite variable. The C:N ratio was lowest for the 5 -foot spacing in both trellis-level and ground-level training. Leaves from the terminal area of the. canes had the lowest C:N ratio...|$|E

40|$|The results {{achieved}} with high density planting (HDP) for apple orchards {{have led to}} a decisive thrust towards this approach in peach orchards. In order to evaluate the potential offered by application of HDP in this species, it is necessary to take into account both the means currently available for tree size control, which regulate canopy light interception and distribution, and also the training system most suitable to obtain high yield and good fruit quality. The main tools for tree size control are discussed: rootstocks, summer pruning, deficit irrigation, genetic modification of peach tree growth habit, root restriction, growth regulators. Furthermore, a survey conducted in the main peach-growing countries of the world, to investigate the extent of utilization and the main aspects characterizing peach and nectarine HDP orchards, is summarized. The most important training systems for HDP are then briefly described (free and sprint palmette, fusetto, delayed vasette, Tatura <b>trellis</b> and related <b>training</b> systems) jointly with their interaction with soil fertility. In medium or low fertile soil the fusetto presents uniform distribution of leaf area, early entry into production, good light penetration and good fruit quality; fusetto allows maximum planting density of 1200 - 1500 trees ha. In contrast, on extremely fertile soil it is necessary to adopt training systems that allow the canopy to develop as a single or double wall of limited thickness. The first alternative (palmette) allows maximum planting densities of 700 - 900 trees/ha. For orchards with planting densities greater than 1000 - 1500 trees/ha, the Tatura trellis and its variants (KAC V, perpendicular V) appear the most appropriate. Overall, the right choice of training system and orchard density will have to be {{made on the basis of}} careful economic analysis, taking into account the greater costs involved for the establishment and often also for the management of HDP...|$|R
