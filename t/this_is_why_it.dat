5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|In some algorithms, an {{intermediate}} result is computed {{in a larger}} precision, then must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, {{the idea is to}} round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called sticky rounding. Equivalently, it consists in returning the intermediate result when it is exactly representable, and the nearest floating-point number with an odd significand otherwise; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is also known as rounding to odd.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} water supply for Damascus are the Fijeh and Barada springs. The Fijeh springs are {{a group of three}} large karstic springs - The Fijeh main spring, the Fijeh side spring and the Harouch spring - in the Barada gorge. The three springs used to {{contribute}} half the flow of the Barada River. The Barada spring is located North of the Fijeh springs close to the Lebanese border. The entire flow of all these springs is captured today, including through wells positioned around the springs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> appears during the summer that the Barada spring has dried up, while its flow is actually being captured and transferred along the river to supply various towns in the Barada gorge as well as Damascus itself with drinking water. Water from the Barada and Fijeh springs is transferred to a mixing station near Dummar where it is being chlorinated and distributed to the city. The city’s water supply is complemented by well fields in the plains around the city. The flow of the springs is highly seasonal, lagging several months behind the precipitation because of snow melt and the karstic characteristics of the rocks from which they emerge. The flow of the Figeh springs is less than 4 m3/second during the low-flow period from July to December. However, it reaches a maximum of more than 12m3/second (average 1962-1991) in April.|$|E

Note that the only exception is when the first throwing team knocks down the Lady before the knights (as described above). When that happens, their balls are removed immediately from the arena. The other team can then complete the joust. After that the first throwing team, as always, starts the next joust.|$|R

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this.

2500|$|The CCT then causes actin's {{sequential}} folding {{by forming}} bonds with its subunits {{rather than simply}} enclosing it in its cavity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> possesses specific recognition areas in its apical β-domain.

Both actin and tubulin bind to CCT in open conformations {{in the absence of}} ATP. In actin’s case, two subunits are bound during each conformational change, whereas for tubulin binding takes place with four subunits. Actin has specific binding sequences, which interact with the δ and β-CCT subunits or with δ-CCT and ε-CCT. After AMP-PNP is bound to CCT the substrates move within the chaperonin’s cavity. It also seems {{that in the case of}} actin, the CAP protein is required as a possible cofactor in actin's final folding states.|$|E

The movements of the jackal are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a seer who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it.

2500|$|For Irenaeus, Paul's {{presentation}} of the Old Law (the Mosaic covenant) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them. [...] He explains that [...] "For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man." [...] Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law. [...] Instead, they need a human Savior. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was necessary for Christ to take human flesh. [...] Irenaeus summarizes how Christ's taking human flesh saves humanity with a statement that closely resembles , [...] "For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation."

We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable.
