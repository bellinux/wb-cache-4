5|$|The video, black-and-white, {{begins with}} Carey parking her antique {{automobile}} in desert. She gets out, with customized black boots with an 'M' on them, and as, she walks towards the camera, the vehicle explodes. As the music begins {{and the scene}} shifts to another where Carey applying her eye make-up and earrings. As a form of product placement, her fragrance is shown on a dresser in her Boudoir. As Carey finishes getting ready, scenery of Las Vegas is shown, before shifting to Carey, now dressed as a Vegas performer. As she walks down a runway dressed in white garments ad feathers, she catches {{the attention of a}} man. He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene {{from the beginning of the}} video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to flail her arms in desperation. The video ends with Carey back at the show in Vegas during the finale, as glitter drops from the top of the stage. Carey, now back in the desert, looks for another ride, and gets into a black Cadillac Escalade driven by Nick Cannon.|$|E

25|$|In 387 AD, {{after the}} {{partition}} of Armenia between Byzantium and Sassanid Persia, two Armenian provinces Artsakh and Utik {{became part of the}} Sassanid satrapy of Caucasian Albania, which, in <b>turn,</b> <b>came</b> under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence. At the time the population of Artsakh and Utik consisted of Armenians and several Armenized tribes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} that the British, French, Germans, Spanish, Polish and Czechoslovakians have all {{modified}} the Latin alphabet for their own usage, and because the Latin alphabet {{is derived from the}} Greek alphabet, which, in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> from Phoenician and Egyptian, there is as much shame attached to using the Latin alphabet as there is in using Arabic numerals and the conventional mathematical symbols, regardless of their point of origin.|$|E
25|$|Naucratis {{soon became}} a {{profound}} source of inspiration to the Greeks by re-exposing them to the wonders of Egyptian architecture and sculpture lost to them since the Bronze Age. Egyptian artifacts soon began their flow along the Greek trade routes finding {{their way into the}} homes and workshops of the Ionian Greek world and, via Aegina, the city-states of mainland Greece. Although Greek art and ideas in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> back the other way their absorption into a largely xenophobic Egyptian culture was strictly minimal.|$|E

25|$|The {{execution}} {{site was}} on the beach, north of the city, and north of the small barn or garage, which {{was used as a}} temporary holding point for the victims while their <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to be executed. A trench had been dug in the dunes that ran parallel to the shore and was about 100 meters long and 3 meters wide. Columns of Jews were formed at the Women's Prison and marched out under guard to the killing site. The guards were Latvians with Germans acting as supervisors.|$|E
25|$|In December 1953 Blair, {{playing for}} New Zealand against South Africa at Johannesburg, {{received}} news that his fiancée, Nerissa Love, {{had been killed}} in the Tangiwai railway disaster on Christmas Eve. Blair was not expected to bat when his <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> on Boxing Day, as an announcement had been made that he would take no further part in the game. In the event, however, he appeared at the crease to join Bert Sutcliffe, who had already started to walk off the field. The packed crowd stood in silence.|$|E
25|$|Before {{engaging}} in hostilities, Philip attempted {{to achieve the}} goals of Protestant policy by peaceful means. He proposed a compromise {{on the subject of}} confiscated church property, {{but at the same time}} he was untiring in preparing for a possible recourse to war and cultivated diplomatic relations with any and all powers whom he knew to have anti-Habsburg interests. A peaceful <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> when arrangements were made with the Emperor at Nuremberg on 25 July, 1532, but this did not prevent Philip from preparing for a future struggle.|$|E

25|$|In 1817, Beauclerk {{played in}} a highly {{controversial}} match at Nottingham in which he captained an All-England team while Osbaldeston and Lambert were given men for Nottingham. Accusations of match-fixing were made by both sides and Beauclerk was able to produce witnesses who implicated Lambert. As a result, MCC banned Lambert from ever playing again at Lord's Cricket Ground. Osbaldeston's <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> in 1818 after he too lost his temper when beaten at single wicket by George Brown of Sussex. Osbaldeston was so angry that he resigned his MCC membership. Later, he repented and asked to be reinstated but Beauclerk refused his application.|$|E
25|$|The first {{church was}} {{probably}} a three-aisled basilica with a large, single western tower adorned with galleries. Its transept extended beyond the main building towards the north and south. Unusually, it lacked a choir projecting towards the east, and thus was almost T-shaped, barring, possibly, a central apse or lesser apses projecting from the transept. Stylistically, this first church was similar to Romanesque churches from Westphalia and the Rhine Valley. A few details seem however to be unique. Among these is {{the arrangement of the}} tower gallery. This in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to inspire many more churches on Gotland, providing a rather distinct architectural style.|$|E
25|$|The mountain's name {{translates}} as Rock of the Topsail, {{and was given}} to it during the expedition of Captain Gaspar de Lemos, begun in 1501, and in which the Rio de Janeiro bay (today Guanabara Bay, but after which the city was named) also received its name. The mountain, {{one of the first}} in Brazil to be named in Portuguese, was named by the expedition's sailors, who compared its silhouette to that of the shape of a topsail of a carrack upon sighting it on January 1, 1502. That name in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to be given to the Gávea area of the city of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in <b>turn,</b> <b>came</b> to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|The game {{itself was}} dogged by wet weather and low-scoring game. Australia won the toss {{and decided to}} field. This {{probably}} looked like the right decision as bowling sensations Ferris and Turner took 9 wickets between them to help dismiss England for 113 all out, with Arthur Shrewsbury top-scoring with 44. When Australia's <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to bat, Lohmann and Peel, bowling unchanged, blitzed them. The Aussies were 35 for 8 at stumps on the first day. As a result of continuing rain, and an intervening Sunday, play did not resume for another 5 days. On resumption, Lohmann and Peel finished Australia off for 42. Turner's 7 for 43 was the highlight as England then set Australia 209 to win. They were never up to it as Lohmann and Peel shared 8 wickets, and England won by 126 runs.|$|E
25|$|There were 15 guests (at Poutrincourt's table), {{each of whom}} in his turn, became steward and caterer of the day. At the dinner, the steward, with napkin on shoulder, {{staff of}} office in hand, and the collar of the order round his neck, led the van. The other guests in {{procession}} followed, each bearing a dish. After grace in the evening, he resigned the insignia to his successor, and they drank {{to each other in}} a cup of wine. It was the steward's duty, to look to supplies, and he would go hunt or fish a day or two before his <b>turn</b> <b>came,</b> and add some dainty to the ordinary fare. During the winter they had fowl and game in abundance, supplied by the Indians and by their own exertions. These feasts were often attended by Indians of all ages and both sexes, sometimes twenty or thirty being present. The Sagamore, or chief, Membertou, the greatest Sagamore of the land, and other chiefs, when there, were treated as guests and equals.|$|E

25|$|The {{new plan}} {{replaced}} trains with six daily bus round trips between Riverhead and Huntington, {{half of which}} went on to Greenport, and two round trips on the weekend between Greenport and Huntington, where connections could be made for train service to New York. Bus service was one way to continue service to eastern stations, replacing certain train trips, and therefore reducing schedules. In <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> reduced maintenance, and extended trip times. The LIRR, with the bus service implemented, was allowed to discontinue one westbound train out of Greenport and one eastbound to Greenport. These buses also served new communities along New York State Route 25 in Central Suffolk, which were three to five miles from Main Line stations. This brought the railroad to passengers rather than having them travel to the railroad. In order to save time, buses ran express along the Smithtown Bypass. Zones were established by the PSC {{in order to prevent}} competition with local bus routes. The area between Huntington station and Deport Road and Jericho Turnpike was Zone one. The second zone was Jericho Turnpike between Larkfield Road and Veteran’s Memorial Highway. Middle County Road between Stony Brook Road and Evergreen Avenue was the third zone. The fourth zone was along Middle Country Road between Evergreen Drive and New York State Route 112. The fifth zone was from Riverhead to Greenport.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 the Italia was {{transferred}} to Genoa—New York City service, marking the beginning of Home Lines' gradual change from the Genoa—South America service to North Atlantic service from Genoa and Germany to New York as well as Southampton to Canada. Brasil was rebuilt and renamed Homeland in 1951, coinciding with her move to Hamburg—Southampton—Halifax—New York service. While on this route she was managed by Hamburg-America Line. However, the Homeland {{was transferred}} to Genoa—Naples—Barcelona—New York service already in 1952, after being replaced by the Italia on the Germany—New York service. The Italia in <b>turn</b> <b>came</b> to be managed by Hamburg-America Line while on the service from Germany. The Argentina was sold to Zim Lines in 1953 and renamed Jerusalem, while the Atlantic {{was transferred to}} National Hellenic American Line in 1954 and renamed Queen Frederica. Home Lines had purchased the laid-up Mariposa from Matson Lines in 1953; she entered service in 1954 as the first Homeric. By 1955 at the latest Home Lines began making cruises from New York to The Bahamas during the winter season. The Homeland was sold for scrap in 1955, leaving Home Lines with just two ships, Italia and Homeric. In 1958 Home Lines abandoned transatlantic traffic to New York (leaving it to Hamburg Atlantic Line). In the same year the Italia was refitted and placed on Hamburg—Quebec service. In 1961 Home Lines gave up transatlantic traffic completely when the Italia was transferred to New York—Bahamas cruise service. Three years later the ship was sold to Freeport Bahama Enterprises {{for use as a}} floating hotel.|$|E
