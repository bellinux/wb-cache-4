5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works.

He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a preeminent authority for the school.|$|E

Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E
30|$|If ROC {{analysis}} will {{not distinguish between}} continuous and discrete mediation, another measure is needed. Kellen and Klauer (2014) provided one such measure. In their study, participants were presented {{with a list of}} 270 words; 135 words were presented once (weak encoding, W) and 135 words were presented three times (strong encoding, S). At test, participants were presented with three-word, target present arrays (their Experiment 2) and <b>were</b> told <b>to</b> rank each of the words from “Most likely <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before” <b>to</b> “Least likely <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before.” The critical measure was the conditional probability that the actually-studied target of the array was ranked second, given that it was not chosen as most likely <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before (c 2).|$|R
