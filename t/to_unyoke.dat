6000|$|The {{carriage}} stopped, and the {{men began}} <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> their horses, while Mr. Archibald gravely superintended {{the removal of the}} baggage from the carriage to the little vessel. [...] "Has the Caroline been long arrived?" [...] said Archibald to one of the seamen.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} you can do, and that's <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> the beast and hobble it, and then strike for Taylor's on your feet," [...] he advised. [...] "The walk will {{probably}} do you good, if only by convincing you that it doesn't pay to drive a horse to the verge of exhaustion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, {{you will}} never get the waggons on in that way, the oxen cannot pull an ounce. The best way will be <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> them, take them across, and get {{them up on the}} level ground on the top; then fasten your ropes {{together}} and hitch them to the waggon. The bullocks, on firm ground, can easily pull it across." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{teams were}} brought round to the yard, and {{immediately}} {{passed by the}} officer, who indeed remarked upon the excellence of the animals. The Kaffirs were directed <b>to</b> outspan or <b>unyoke</b> the oxen, for whom rations of hay and grain were at once issued.|$|R
6000|$|So one morning, {{having already}} got up my oxen, I told Scowl to inspan them--an order which he {{received}} with joy, for {{he and the}} other boys wished to be off to civilisation and its delights. Just as the operation was beginning, however, a message came to me from old Umbezi, who begged me to delay my departure till after noon, as a friend of his, a big chief, had come to visit him who wished much to have the honour of making my acquaintance. Now, I wished the big chief farther off, but, as it seemed rude to refuse the request of one who had been so kind to me, I ordered the oxen <b>to</b> be <b>unyoked</b> but kept at hand, and in an irritable frame of mind walked up to the kraal. This was about half a mile from my place of outspan, for as soon as I was sufficiently recovered I had begun to sleep in my wagon, leaving the big hut to the [...] "Worn-out-Old-Cow." ...|$|R
60|$|The King's march, {{through the}} Forest of Reppen, {{was nothing like}} so expeditious as had been expected. There are thickets, intricacies, runlets, boggy oozes; {{indifferent}} to one man well mounted, but vitally important to 30,000 with heavy cannon to bring on. Boggy oozings especially,--there is one dirty stream or floss (HUNERFLIESS, Hen-Floss) which wanders dismally through those recesses, issuing from the far south, with dirty daughters dismally wandering into it, and others that cannot get into it (being of the lake kind): these, in their weary, circling, recircling course towards Oder,--FAULE LAACKE (Foul Lake, LITHER-MERE, as it were), Foul Bridge, Swine's Nook (SCHWEINEBUCKT), and many others,--occasion endless difficulty. Whether Major Linden was shot that day, or what became of him after, I do not know: but it was pity he had not studied {{the ground with a}} soldier's eye instead of a hunter's! Plumping suddenly, at last, upon Hen-Floss itself, Friedrich has to turn angularly; angularly, which occasions great delay: the heavy cannon (wall-guns brought from Custrin) have twelve horses each, and cannot turn among the trees, but have <b>to</b> be <b>unyoked,</b> reyoked, turned round by hand:--in short, it was eight in the morning before Friedrich arrived {{at the edge of the}} wood, on the Klosterberg, Walckberg, and other woody BERGS or knolls, within reach of Muhlberg, and behind the preliminary abatis there (abatis which was rather of service to him than otherwise);--and began privately building his batteries.|$|R
60|$|I did get {{a little}} sleep that night, with one eye open, but before dawn I was up again seeing to the feeding of our {{remaining}} horse with some mealies that we carried, and other matters. The oxen we had been obliged <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> that they might fill themselves with grass and water, since otherwise I feared that we should never get them on to their feet again. As it was, the poor brutes were so tired {{that some of them}} could scarcely eat, and all lay down at the first opportunity.|$|E
60|$|When the waggon had creaked {{to the top}} of the rise, for, of course, {{there was}} no road, and the Kaffirs were {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> the hungry oxen, Rachel, who was riding with her father, sprang from her horse and ran to it to help her mother to descend. She was now a tall young woman, full of health and vigour, strong and straightly shaped. Mrs. Dove, frail, delicate, grey-haired, placed her foot upon the disselboom and hesitated, for to her the ground seemed far off, and the heels of the cattle very near.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} at daybreak the caravan started. The hunters' report {{of the state of}} the roads was fairly borne out, and {{although}} some difficulties were met with it was unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> the oxen, although of course many boulders had to be cleared away to allow them to pass. On emerging at the upper end of the defile they found they were in a valley which opened out to a great width, and rose in gradual slopes at its head to the crest of the hills. As the only egress at the lower end was by the defile, it was clear that the whole rainfall must make its way by this exit, which fully accounted for the tremendous torrent they had witnessed.|$|E
60|$|An hour's riding {{brought them}} to the caravan, where their news created a great sensation. Hitherto the danger from Indians had {{appeared}} a remote trouble, which might not, after all, befall them. The news that fifty or sixty of these dreaded foes were marching along, almost within sight, and might at any moment attack them, brought the danger close indeed. The waggons were driven in even closer order; the women and children were told to keep between the lines; the men distributed themselves among the teams, ready <b>to</b> <b>unyoke</b> the oxen at the shortest notice, and to form the waggons in order of defence. Abe and his companions had not yet returned; but {{a quarter of an hour}} later they were seen galloping towards the camp.|$|E
