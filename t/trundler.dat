2500|$|He had two {{outstanding}} matches {{to start}} the 1927-28 Sheffield Shield season. In Adelaide he took 5 for 53 off 29.2 overs as South Australia made 189 for 9 to win the match. A week later, after Bill Ponsford and Bill Woodfull had put on 227 for the first wicket for Victoria in Melbourne, he took 7 for 77 and Victoria were dismissed for 355. The Argus noted that on a perfect pitch, McNamee bowled with both [...] "an out swing and an in turn" [...] and that his performance [...] "marks him as the most promising bowler in Australia, and the importance to Australian cricket is very great". Ponsford thought [...] "it may be that he {{will prove to be}} the man for whom Australia is looking. He more than most bowlers today resembles the old type of medium paced <b>trundler,</b> who gained their successes by accuracy of length, spin, and a direct attack on the batsmen's defences." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{boundary}} Sarfraz {{looked like a}} medium paced <b>trundler,</b> but the six-foot-six tall cricketer [...] was [...] "as strong as a cart-horse" [...] and his powerful upper body and good action allowed him to bowl at a fast-medium pace. He could seam the ball in either direction and despite the convention he repeatedly bounced other fast bowlers such as Jeff Thomson and Joel Garner. The flat wickets found in Pakistan were not ideal for a bowler of his pace, but could sometimes surprise batsmen with his ability to make to ball seam, swing or bounce awkwardly. [...] More importantly with Sikander Bakht Sarfraz developed reverse swing. Commentators did not realise this was reverse swing at the time, though they realised {{that he had an}} uncanny ability to move the old ball in the air. He passed on his knowledge to Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who made this new type of bowling famous in the late 1980s and 1990s. As a batsman he was a good lower-order striker of the ball particularly when driving and averaged over 40 in a series on three occasions.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{it is due}} to {{the pure}} air of the country or to daily manual toil is not known, {{but the fact remains that}} bowlers in village matches, {{whatever}} their other shortcomings, seldom fall short in the matter of speed. The present <b>trundler,</b> having swung his arm round like a flail, bounded to the crease and sent down a ball which hummed in the air. It pitched halfway between the wickets in a slight hollow caused by the foot of a cow and shot. Dick reached blindly forward, and the next moment his off-stump was out of the ground.|$|E
60|$|The bowling was collared. The demon {{had long}} since retired grumbling to the deep field. Weird <b>trundlers,</b> with actions like nothing else on earth, had been tried, had fired their ringing shot, and passed. One {{individual}} had gone on with lobs, to the acute delight of everybody except the fieldsmen who had to retrieve the balls and the above-mentioned cow. And still Tom and Dick stayed in and smote, while in the west the sun slowly sank.|$|R
60|$|I had to {{wait for}} the latter at the parting of the ways; for the tram had a brand-new {{serpentine}} track laid out for it, while the old trail at this point struck up to the right, coming out eventually at a shrine that crowned the summit of the pass. Horse-railroads not being as new to me as to the Japanese, I piously chose the narrow way leading to the temple, to the lingering regret of the baggage <b>trundlers,</b> who turned sorry eyes down upon the easier secular road at every bend in our own.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{after some}} painful groping in the dark, and {{repeated}} resolves to proceed on {{foot to the}} town and summon help, I chanced to stumble upon a stray kuruma, which had incautiously returned, under cover of the darkness, {{to the scene of}} its earlier exploits. I secured it on the spot, and by it was trundled across a bit of the plain and up the long hill crowned by the town, to the pleasing jingle of a chime of rings hung somewhere out of sight beneath the body of the vehicle. When the <b>trundler</b> asked where to drop me, I gave at a venture the name that sounded the best, only to be sure of having guessed awry when he drew up before the inn it designated. The existence of a better was legible on the face of it. We pushed on.|$|E
50|$|A hand truck, {{also known}} as a dolly, two wheeler, stack truck, trolley, <b>trundler,</b> box cart, trolley truck, sack barrow, sack truck, or bag barrow, is an L-shaped box-moving {{handcart}} with handles at one end, wheels at the base, with a small ledge to set objects on, flat against the floor when the hand-truck is upright. The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and object are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the large wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a first-class lever.|$|E
