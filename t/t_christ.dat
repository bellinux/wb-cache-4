Dirks said he would step down upon the selection of a successor, who will be picked by a search committee of a dozen university leaders.

5000|$|Sheldon was a {{graduate}} of Phillips Academy, Andover (Class of 1879). He became an advocate of the late nineteenth century school of thought known as Christian Socialism. His theological outlook focused on the practicalities of the moral life, with much less emphasis on the doctrinal traditions of personal redemption from sin in Christ. In the winter of 1896 Sheldon developed a sermon story that he read as a weekly series from the pulpit of Central Congregational Church in Topeka, Kansas. The unifying theme of these sermons was based on posing the question, [...] "what would Jesus do?" [...] when facing moral decisions. He viewed this question as traditional within Christianity and likely drew some inspiration from William <b>T.</b> Stead's If <b>Christ</b> came to Chicago! (1893) and other earlier sources.|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the new covenant to the church today requires a careful look into both the OT and the NT. When Jesus mentioned the new covenant as he was instituting the bread and the cup. he clearly indicated its sigmficance for the church. When the OT is examined to discover what this new covenant involved. and when the NT is investigated for further clarification. {{it becomes clear that}} only one new covenant is in view. even though different groups may derive somewhat varying benefits from it. The essence of the new covenant is spiritual regeneration. enjoyed now by Christian believers and prophesied for national Israel at the second coming of <b>Christ.</b> <b>T</b> HE concept of "covenant " is a pivotal one in biblical studies. Both the OT and NT utilize words denoting this idea, and their contexts reveal how crucial certain covenants were in explaining the actions which followed. Gleason Archer's definition of the term may serve as a working guide: A compact or agreement between two parties binding them mutually to undertakings on each other's behalf. Theologically (used of relations between God and man) it denotes a gracious undertaking entered into by God for the benefit and blessing of man, and specifically of those men who by faith receive the promises and commit themselves to the obligations which this undertaking involves. I Students of Scripture are particularly concerned with the cov-enants which God has announced for man. Inasmuch as these are expressions of his will, his promises, and his demands, they are supremely important to the Christian who has committed his trust and allegiance to God and the doing of his will...|$|R
40|$|The  1 AR has two binding sites {{which can}} be {{activated}} to cause cardiostimulation. The first, termed,  1 HAR (high affinity site of  1 AR) is activated by noradrenaline and adrenaline and is blocked by relatively low concentrations of β-blockers including carvedilol (Kaumann and Molenaar, 2008). The other, termed,  1 LAR (low affinity site of  1 AR) has lower affinity for noradrenaline and adrenaline and is activated by some β-blockers including CGP 12177 and pindolol, at higher concentrations than those required to block the receptor (Kaumann and Molenaar, 2008). (-) -CGP 12177 is a non-conventional partial agonist that causes modest and transient increases of contractile force in human atrial trabeculae (Kaumann and Molenaar, 2008). These effects are markedly increased and maintained by inhibition of phosphodiesterase PDE 3. The stimulant effects of (-) -CGP 12177 at human β 1 ARs was verified with recombinant receptors (Kaumann and Molenaar, 2008). However, {{in a recent report}} it was proposed that the positive inotropic effects of CGP 12177 are mediated through  3 ARs in human right atrium (Skeberdis et al 2008). This proposal was not consistent with the lack of blockade of (-) -CGP 12177 inotropic effects or increases in L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa-L) by the β 3 AR blocker 1 μM LY 748, 337 (Christ et al, 2010). On the otherhand, (-) -CGP 12177 increases in inotropic effects and ICa-L were blocked by (-) -bupranolol 1 - 10 μM (Christ et al, 2010). Chronic infusion of (-) -CGP 12177 (10 mg/Kg/ 24 hours) for four weeks in an aortic constriction mouse model of heart failure caused an increase in left ventricular wall thickness, fibrosis and inflammation-related left ventricular gene expression levels. <b>Christ</b> <b>T</b> et al (2010) Br J Pharmacol, In press Kaumann A and Molenaar P (2008) Pharmacol Ther 118, 303 - 336 Skeberdis VA et al (2008) J Clin Invest, 118, 3219 - 3227...|$|R
