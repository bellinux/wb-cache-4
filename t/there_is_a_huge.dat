5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E

25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} three floors beneath the statue: {{the halls of}} the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned {{features}} inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha, consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains. Only visitors who purchase an offering for the Buddha are allowed to see the relic, entering to leave it there. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> carved bell inscribed with images of Buddhas in the show room.

25|$|Balamurugan Temple, Pachaimalai {{is one of}} the two old hill temples {{dedicated}} to Lord Murugan while the other being Muthukumaraswamy Temple, Pavalamalai.

All Saivite, Koumaram and other Hindu festivals are celebrated at the temples, especially Thai Poosam, Panguni Uthiram and Skanda Sashti. At Pachaimalai, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> statue of Lord Senthilandavar, which can be seen miles away from the temple.

25|$|At a site just to {{the east}} of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council has been pushing for a station at North Kensington / Kensal off Ladbroke Grove & Canal Way, as a {{turn-back}} facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> amount of support for the project and Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough. TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station and the project is backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury's and Cath Kidston, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly).|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{population}} of NRIs in West Asia, most coming from Kerala and Hyderabad. They work as engineers, doctors, lawyers, labourers and in clerical jobs. Unlike in Europe and America, {{most of the}} countries in West Asia do not grant citizenship or permanent residency to these Indians, however long they might live there. The Persian Gulf region has provided incomes many times over for the same type of job in India and has geographical proximity to India, and these incomes are free of taxation. The NRIs make up a good proportion of the working class in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). NRI population in these GCC countries is estimated to be around 20 million, of which a quarter is resident in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 2005, about 75% of the population in the UAE was of Indian descent. The majority originate from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, and Goa. Similarly, Indians are the single largest nationality in Qatar, representing around 85% of the total population as of 2014. They also form majorities in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman. The have a minority in Saudi Arabia. The NRI population tends to save and remit considerable amounts to their dependents in India. It is estimated such remittances may be over USD 10 billion per annum (including remittances by formal and informal channels in 2007-2008). Since these people travel to their homes often twice or thrice a year, they are very close to the Indian culture. There are TV soaps aimed at them, especially Tiarts for Goans living in UAE. There are shows that happen quite often through community groups in the UAE. Many NRIs live {{for a couple of months}} a year in India, often during the holiday periods. They often continue their banking relationships and telecom relationships in India.|$|E
500|$|A social unit is a {{group of}} sperm whales who live and travel {{together}} over a period of years. [...] Individuals rarely, if ever, join or leave a social unit. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> variance in the size of social units. They are most commonly between six and nine individuals in size but can have more than twenty. Unlike orcas, sperm whales within a social unit show no significant tendency to associate with their genetic relatives. [...] Females and calves spend about three quarters of their time foraging and a quarter of their time socializing. Socializing usually takes place in the afternoon.|$|E
