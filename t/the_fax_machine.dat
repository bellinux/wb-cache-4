500|$|The episode {{started a}} new mythology for the series {{questioning}} the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed {{to be interested in}} the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man {{who was one of the}} people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials persuaded the writers to help Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes [...] "Two Fathers" [...] and [...] "One Son". Carter developed the script in Vancouver, Canada while working on the pilot for his series Harsh Realm, providing pages to the production crew via <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{have claimed}} that {{technological}} innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery, predicting that <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine,</b> and then the internet, would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for fast courier services but there is certainly some truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the U.S. Department of Labor statistics does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include [...] "independent contractors" [...] in statistics referenced for this industry occupation, but reports indicate the business is shrinking.|$|E

5000|$|An example {{put forth}} by Rogers in Diffusion of Innovations was that of <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine,</b> which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the {{technology}} of faxes, {{including the use of}} existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> reached a critical mass in 1987, when [...] "Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine".|$|E

5000|$|Prosecutors {{obtained}} {{evidence that}} Spano had forged numerous letters from bank officials {{in his business}} dealings from 1995 onward.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of receiving <b>faxes</b> through <b>the</b> computer {{is that the}} computer has to be turned on and running <b>the</b> <b>fax</b> software to receive any faxes.
