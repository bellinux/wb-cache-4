5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana toll plaza using an open <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system. As of October 2010, Bregana toll plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to semi-trailer trucks. The toll charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the distance travelled and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENCan electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks.

5|$|The A6 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A1 motorway. The two roads connect at the Bosiljevo2 interchange, forming a unified toll system. Since the A1 motorway is operated jointly by Autocesta RijekaZagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system is operated jointly by the two operators. As of October 2010, the toll charged along the A6 route between Bosiljevo2 interchange (A1 Bosiljevo exit) and the Kikovica mainline toll plaza varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled and ranges from 6.00 kuna (0.82 euros) to 33.00 kuna (4.52 euros) for passenger cars and 25.00 kuna (3.42 euro) to 139.00 kuna (19.04 euro) for semi-trailer trucks.

5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass <b>toll</b> <b>collection,</b> which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system is also used. The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
5|$|The A4 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. As of October 2010, toll charged along the A4 route between the Sveta Helena and Goričan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled and ranges from 7.00 kuna (€0.96) to 36.00 kuna (€4.93) for passenger cars and 22.00 kuna (€3.01) to 120.00 kuna (€16.44) for semi-trailer trucks.

The northernmost section of the motorway, between the border and Goričan interchange (inclusive) is not tolled. Similarly, the southernmost part of the A4 motorway route, located between Sveta Helena and Ivanja Reka interchanges (inclusive) is also toll-free, as it {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, which services a significant volume of traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the East-West Link Expressway started in 1993 and was completed in 1995. The expressway was opened on 17 August 1995. On 17 May 2011, the <b>toll</b> <b>collections</b> of the expressway from Salak Interchange to Taman Connaught Interchange were abolished.|$|R

5000|$|J. Turner Butler Boulevard, the Fuller Warren Bridge, Mathews Bridge, Hart Bridge and Trout River Bridge were tolled by JTA until 1988, when Jacksonville voters {{approved}} a ½¢ sales tax increase {{to pay off}} the toll bonds, fund future road construction, and abolish <b>toll</b> <b>collections.</b>|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{under the}} <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> regime of the HRBC, daily traffic was {{recorded}} to be {{a minimum of}} 28,000 vehicles and a maximum of 39,000 vehicles in 2000, but fell {{to a maximum of}} around 30,000 vehicles by December 2002, when the management of the toll plaza was handed over to a private firm. Subsequently, the daily traffic reached a minimum of 45,000 vehicles and a maximum of 61,000 vehicles by early 2008, against a maximum capacity of 85,000 vehicles per day. The original management of the toll revenue collection by HRBC was consequently criticized for corruption and significant loss of revenue.|$|E
5|$|On November24, 2004, the {{day before}} Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union {{employees}} went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike {{in the history of}} the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> resumed December1.|$|E
5|$|The E751 mostly {{consists}} of motorways, but considerable sections are either expressways or two-lane roads with at-grade intersections. All motorway {{sections of the}} E751 are tolled, using the electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) and ticket systems. Since the 1980s, the E751 has gradually been upgraded from a regular two-lane road to motorway standards, and further upgrades are still being carried out or planned in some areas, particularly in the Rijeka–Kanfanar section and in the section located in Slovenia. The bulk of the E751 {{consists of}} the Istrian Y roads operated by BINA Istra. The part of the route in Slovenia is managed by the Slovenian Roads Agency, part of the Government of Slovenia.|$|E
50|$|On November 14, 2007, {{the board}} decided toll booths {{would not be}} used, and on June 5, 2008, the State House voted to approve $25 {{million a year for}} 39 years for the project. This would cover the {{difference}} between expected <b>toll</b> <b>collections</b> and actual costs.|$|R
50|$|On February 19, 2011, the HEFT ceased cash <b>toll</b> <b>collections,</b> {{becoming}} an exclusively electronic toll road, {{a move that}} was announced in November 2009.

5|$|The {{application}} {{on urban}} roads is currently {{limited to a}} few cities, including London, Stockholm, Singapore, Milan, and Gothenburg, {{as well as a}} few smaller towns, such as Durham, England; Znojmo, Czech Republic; Riga (the scheme ended in 2008), Latvia; and Valletta, Malta. Four general types of systems are in use; a cordon area around a city center, with charges for passing the cordon line; area wide congestion pricing, which charges for being inside an area; a city center toll ring, with <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> surrounding the city; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing, where access to a lane or a facility is priced.|$|E
5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic <b>toll</b> <b>collection.</b> It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E

25|$|The tolls {{collected}} on the Crescent City Connection were defined in Louisiana state law R.S. 47:820.5(B). This law said that from October 1, 1994 through December 31, 2012, tolls were to be collected {{at a rate of}} $0.20 per axle for toll tag users, and $0.50 per axle for cash users. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, annual <b>toll</b> <b>collections</b> averaged $20 million.|$|R
50|$|The tollbooths on the Maine Turnpike {{were not}} {{supposed}} to be permanent. <b>Toll</b> <b>collections</b> were to stop once the Maine Turnpike Authority paid off the debt from the road's construction. In the 1980s the bonds were going to be paid off but the Maine Legislature authorized the Maine Turnpike Authority in 1982 to continue as a quasi-governmental agency and to continue to collect tolls in order to fund the maintenance of the section of highway controlled by the MTA.|$|R
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the report, Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. Pål Kårbø was elected new chairman. At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The toll changed the operator of the toll plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the toll plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue. The <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> was scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection,</b> electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} tolled parkways in Kentucky, the Audubon {{and the nearby}} William H. Natcher Parkway, which opened in 1972, had their tolls removed on Tuesday, November 21, 2006.

40|$|Tolling is an age long revenue {{collection}} system institutionalised by public authorities for accumulating funds required for {{roads and bridges}} construction, maintenance and management. In spite of the merits of tolling as {{a major source of}} revenue in Nigeria, it was abruptly abrogated by the government few years ago because of reasons linked to ineffective governance, endemic corruption and lack of probity. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make a case for responsible investment as an alternative funding mechanism for roads-bridges management (RBM) in Nigeria under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework. The paper adopts a discursive approach, relying on government policy documents, journal articles, online resources, working papers and reports on tolling best practices. The numerical and non-numerical data were critically analysed using content analysis enriched by tables and figures. The first finding indicates there are enormous potentials in <b>tolls</b> <b>collection</b> from privately funded roads and bridges for responsible investors in Nigeria under the PPP framework. The second finding identifies eight (8) PPP typologies that could be explored by investors under government’s new tolling policy. The paper concludes that the success of any <b>tolls</b> <b>collection</b> systems depend largely on effectiveness of governance, probity and accountability, which are core elements of responsible investment in the contemporary time...|$|R
