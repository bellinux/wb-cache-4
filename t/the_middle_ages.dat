5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E

The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches.

5|$|For much of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> England's climate {{differed}} {{from that in}} the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of warmer temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier. These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the Little Ice Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This cold end to <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} explore how to provide death {{education}} according to age groups, we examined {{the differences in the}} awareness of death between the adolescent and <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> groups. A questionnaire survey was conducted using the Death Concern Scale. The subjects were students (n= 627) aged between 19 and 29 (i. e. the adolescent group), company workers (n= 149) and visiting nurses (n= 94) aged between 30 and 64 (i. e. <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group). First, <b>the</b> question items were analyzed by content analysis and confirmed by factor analysis. Two factors were extracted from the Death Concern Scale:”thinking about death ” and ”anxiety and fear of death”. Secondly, the data from both age groups were analyzed and compared by using the Mean Structure Model. The factor ”thinking about death” had a greater value for the adolescent group than for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in terms of the factor ”anxiety and fear of death”. These results imply that death education carries more importance for the adolescent group than for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group...|$|R
