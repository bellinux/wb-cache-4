The auction format of 91-day treasury bill has changed from uniform price to multiple price to encourage more responsible bidding from the market players.The bills are of two kinds- Adhoc and regular. The adhoc bills are issued for investment by the state governments, semi government departments and foreign central banks for <b>temporary</b> <b>investment.</b> They are not sold to banks and general public. The treasury bills sold to the public and banks are called regular treasury bills. They are freely marketable and commercial banks buy entire quantities of such bills, issued on tender. They are bought and sold on discount basis. Ad-hoc bills were abolished in April 1997.|$|E

A panel model for the years 1993 - 98 is estimated confirming the explanatory power of the tax variable. The estimation also shows that firms reduced leverage {{in the last three}} years (1996 - 98) as a reaction to important tax changes; the reduction in 1996 was the effect of the <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax credit of the previous year, while the one in 1997 - 98 was the result of the business tax reform started in 1997. The reform, by modifying the system for taxing profits, termed Dual income Tax (DIT), and introducing a new regional tax on business activity (IRAP), reduced the bias against equity finance that was present in the previous tax system. Focusing on the reform, a Logit model is estimated to highlight the characteristics of firms that used the DIT tax system in the first two years. The probability of using the DIT increases with profitability, productivity and investment. The significance of the latter variable suggests that the DIT system was used by firms to reduce the cost of financing new investments after the <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax credit of 1995. corporate taxation, corporate financial policy, tax reform...|$|E

40|$|Even modest {{reductions}} in the after-tax cost of capital purchases provide strong incentives for increased investment. Indeed, for tax subsidies that are temporary, and for capital goods that are very long-lived, the incentive to invest when the after-tax price is temporarily low is essentially infinite. Firms that would have purchased new capital equipment in the future, instead make their purchases {{during the period of}} the subsidy. For tax increases, the effects are the opposite. Firms, that would have normally invested now, delay until the tax rate returns to normal. We present a model of the equilibrium effects of <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax incentives. The model reveals a simple relationship between the shadow price of investment goods and the size of a <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax incentive. Specifically, for sufficiently long-lived capital goods (goods with very low rates of economic depreciation) and for sufficiently short-lived investment tax subsidies, the shadow value of capital should be nearly unchanged, and thus the pre-tax shadow price of capital goods should fully reflect the magnitude of the tax subsidy. This result holds regardless of the elasticity of investment supply and regardless of the underlying demand for capital. Instead, it relies only on the firm’s ability to arbitrage predictable movements in the after-tax price of long-lived capital over time. Two conclusions immediately follow. First, observ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the economy’s {{reaction to a}} <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax subsidy. Because the eventual payoff from acquiring a long-lived capital good is unrelated to the date of purchase or installation, there are powerful incentives to delay or accelerate investment {{to take advantage of}} predictable intertemporal variations in cost.

Consequently, for a temporary tax change, the shadow price of long-lived capital goods fully reflects the tax subsidy regardless of the elasticity of investment supply. While price data provide no information on the elasticity of supply, they reveal the extent to which adjustment costs are internal or external to the firm. The elasticity of investment supply can be inferred from quantity data alone. The bonus depreciation allowance passed in 2002 and increased in 2003 provides a sharp test of the theory. In the law, certain types of long-lived capital goods qualify for substantial tax subsides while others do not.

To achieve the above objective research questions were raised, hypotheses were formulated, and a review of related literature was made. In order to generate the necessary data for this study, data were sourced from the financial statements of banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin for a period of 15 years, i. e. 1995 – 2009. The data generated for the study were analyzed with the multiple regression analysis.

40|$|Theory with Evidence from Bonus Depreciation This paper {{considers}} the economy’s {{reaction to a}} <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax subsidy. Because the eventual payoff from acquiring a long-lived capital good is unrelated to the date of purchase or installation, there are powerful incentives to delay or accelerate investment {{to take advantage of}} predictable intertemporal variations in cost. For these goods, the elasticity of investment demand is nearly infinite. Consequently, for a temporary tax change, the price of long-lived capital goods fully reflects the tax subsidy regardless of the elasticity of investment supply. This result is very general and relies only on an arbitrage argument. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, price data provide no information on the elasticity of supply. Instead, because the price of investment goods shifts by exactly the amount of the subsidy, the elasticity of investment supply can be inferred from quantity data alone. The bonus depreciation allowance passed in 2002 and increased in 2003 provides a sharp test of the theory. In the law, certain types of long-lived capital goods qualify for substantial tax subsides while others do not. The data show that investment in capital that qualified for the subsidy was substantially higher than capital that did not. The adjustment cost parameters implied by the data are in line with estimates from earlier studies. Market prices do not react to the subsidy, which suggests that internal adjustment costs not reflected in market prices are important for investment decisions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper sees {{into the}} problem of {{bringing}} a certain macroeconomic system to the turnpike line of development along the trajectory, which, in terms of some quadratic quality criterion, approximates the proportions of gross output to optimal ones. Moreover, optimal proportions of gross output {{are considered to be}} the proportions of the turnpike economic system. A turnpike system is formed due to a selective control of the final demand vector, thanks to which the final demand vector becomes balanced. Optimal control of a developing microeconomic system allows achieving turnpike growth rates of a master system in the fastest way possible. The basis is an input–output dynamic model between the branches that was developed by Wassily Leontief. Selective control is based on interrelation of dynamic module secular equation roots and variable parameters, which are, in these terms, elements of the final demand vector. An objective of optimal control in this paper is formation of a linear-quadratic regulator, which can help to bring a certain microeconomic system on the trajectory of the already existing turnpike system. The use of qualitatively new principles of selective control in order to analyze and manage the balanced growth of gross output makes it possible to influence the specified movement components of dynamic macro-systems. Such inclusion of economic and mathematical methods in the objectives of state regulation of microeconomics is worth being considered as the most prospective. When applying methods of selective and optimal control of final demand and external investment effects on microeconomic systems it is possible to create and maintain turnpike growth rates of these systems, analyze and optimize <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> processes in the phase space of industries and provide financial and economic information about costs and investments for decision-makers in terms of optimal economic development...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 {{highlights}} {{a source}} of financial frictions associated with intangible assets. I construct new measures of firm-level intangible and physical assets using accounting information on U. S. public firms. I find that firms with a higher initial share of intangible assets (i) start smaller, (ii) grow faster, and (iii) have higher market value per unit of total assets. Intangible share predicts firm dynamics for up to 40 years but its predictive power diminishes over time. I develop a model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions in which firm size and growth are limited by the enforceability of financial contracts. The share of intangible assets matters because physical and intangible assets differ in their residual value for the firm when the financial contract is repudiated. In the model, firms whose production technology depends more heavily on intangible assets face tighter borrowing limits and take a longer time to mature. The model can quantitatively reproduce key empirical facts on firm dynamics and quantify financial frictions associated with physical and intangible assets. Chapter 2 provides a framework to disentangle embodied and disembodied progresses. Intuitively, a faster rate of embodied progress reduces the service life of capital goods and discourages continued investment in old vintages. I propose to use data on capital service life and investment allocation to indirectly inform the rate of investment-specific technological change. The model features a nontrivial allocation of investment across capital vintages and endogenous capital service lives. Aggregate demand growth provides an incentive to expand production with old capital, yet modern sectors drive up labor costs and induce old-fashioned firms to exit. The endogenous exit decision determines the economic service life of capital. In Chapter 3, we propose a model with physical and intangible assets and estimate it with a self-collected comprehensive database. Under standard assumptions, physical investment depends on its after-tax cost and the tax-adjusted q. Conventional models provide biased estimates because they ignore intangibles. We estimate our model using several episodes of <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> tax incentives in the early 2000 s.

Using a tax policy of bonus depreciation as external shock, House and Shapiro estimate the investment supply elasticity, and find that with a <b>temporary</b> ITC, <b>investment</b> in qualified capital increases sharply. Altug et al. (2009)’s conclusion is quite distinctive. They find that a temporary or low policy-persistence ITC generally increases variability of investment both in the short run and in the long run, which means that a temporary ITC is not always related to higher level of investment but always leads to more volatile investment.|$|R

40|$|The global {{slowdown}} {{appears to}} have {{come to an end}} during the summer of 2009. Most countries saw a smaller decline in economic activity in the second quarter, with some economies even recording positive growth rates once again. In the U. S. A., the economic contraction moderated {{in the second quarter of}} 2009, with the government’s economic stimulus packages and net exports making positive contributions to GDP growth, and the negative contribution from investment decreasing significantly vis-à-vis the previous quarter. With the household saving rate rising sharply, private consumption is making a negative contribution to growth. Although this development may help to reduce global imbalances, it could dampen the recovery in the U. S. A. In the euro area, too, there are signs of a gradual improvement, with GDP declining by a mere 0. 1 % quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2009. This growth was underpinned not only by a strong positive contribution from net exports, but also consumption. The likelihood of a further increase in consumption, however, is uncertain, as the labor market situation is set to deteriorate and because consumer demand has recently been bolstered by fiscal stimulus packages that were only <b>temporary.</b> <b>Investment</b> remained weak, as capacity utilization was extremely low. Current forecasts predict a gradual recovery in the euro area economy. In the summer of 2009, euro area inflation bottomed out, with the HICP falling by 0. 7 % in July. This was due primarily to base effects stemming from commodity prices. The latest forecasts predict that there will be no risks to price stability until the end of 2010. The Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries also recorded considerable declines in GDP growth in the first half of 2009. However, the stabilization of the financial markets, as well as leading indicators, suggest that there will be an improvement over the rest of the year. In many countries, the recession brought about reductions in current account deficits. After posting negative growth rates for four consecutive quarters, the Austrian economy is set to pick up again in the second half of 2009, mainly on the back of improved external conditions, fiscal stimulus packages and inventory cycle developments. The OeNB’s latest short-term indicator results show real GDP growth at 0. 4 % in both the third and fourth quarters of 2009 (seasonally and working day-adjusted, on a quarterly basis).

40|$|Excerpt] According to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U. S. {{economy has}} been in {{recession}} since December 2007. Congress passed and the President signed an economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 5), in February 2009. The $ 787 billion package included $ 286 billion in tax cuts to help stimulate the economy. Among the tax reductions, many were tax incentives directed to business. The preliminary estimate of third quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is 2. 8 %; the unemployment rate, a lagging indicator, averaged 9. 6 % {{in the third quarter}} and 10. 0 % {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2009. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expects the economy to continue growing at a modest pace, but predicts that bank lending will remain constrained and the job market will remain weak into at least 2010. To further assist unemployed workers, help business, and stimulate housing markets, Congress passed the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 92). The Obama Administration has advocated further business tax incentives to spur investment and employment, especially for small business. The two most common measures to provide business tax incentives for new investment are investment tax credits and accelerated deductions for depreciation. The evidence, however, suggests that a business tax subsidy may not necessarily be the best choice for fiscal stimulus, largely because of the uncertainty of its success in stimulating aggregate demand. If such subsidies are used, however, the most effective short-run policy is probably a <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> subsidy. Permanent investment subsidies may distort the allocation of investment in the long run. Employment and wage subsidies are designed to increase employment directly by reducing a firm’s wage bill. The tax system is a frequently used means for providing employment subsidies. Most of the business tax incentives for hiring currently under discussion are modeled partially on the New Jobs Tax Credit (NJTC) from 1977 and 1978. Evidence provided in various studies suggests that incremental tax credits have the potential of increasing employment, but in practice may not be as effective in increasing employment as desired. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, jobs tax credits are often complex and many employers, especially small businesses, may not want to incur the necessary record-keeping costs. Second, since eligibility for the tax credit is determined when the firm files the annual tax return, firms do not know if they are eligible for the credit at the time hiring decisions are made. Third, many firms may not even be aware of the availability of the tax credit until it is time to file a tax return. Lastly, product demand appears to be the primary determinant of hiring...|$|E
40|$|Objective – Islamic Banking {{is closely}} related to the real sector. Then, its {{operation}} should reflect the real sector which is expected to contribute to the sustainable economic growth. Nevertheless, Islamic banks are still benchmarking the price of their products (profit sharing and sales) on interest rate. This is as an implication of the implementation of the dual banking system. Moreover, the small portion of Islamic banking compared to the total national banks causes the competitiveness of Islamic banking product in terms of pricing has a high correlation with the interest rate of conventional counterpart. This phenomenon indicates the need to find. Method – This research employed library research method since this paper relies on secondary data by thoroughly reviewing the most relevant literature. The paper attempt to propose a pricing indicator which is based on the real sector activities as the root of Islamic banking operations. Result – Theoretically, this indicator can reflect the real rate of return of every industry sector. In addition, it can help Bank Indonesia to monitor the real sector performance and analyze the possible gap between real sector activities and financial sector. Furthermore, when the benchmark of real rate of real sector return is available, the return index of Islamic banking reflecting the profit sharing performance of the whole Islamic banking industry can be formulated. This concept is different with other indexes which are corresponding to the price of financial assets. Conclusion – In general, return index of real sector as a reference for Islamic banking product pricing is expected to define the way of non-interest return analysis, to calculate the non-interest return of selected sectors that becomes the focus of analysis using Cash Recovery Rates (CRR), forming an index of industry by sector in the second stage, by doing a certain weighting of those companies, to analyze the relationship between macro factors and CRR by sector and to forecast.   Modeling the Demand for Family and General Takaful in Malaysia (A Comparative Study) : ARDL Approach to Cointegration Objective- Nowadays, numerous studies focus on the determinant of the demand for takaful, either family or general takaful in Malaysia. In this respect, these studies employ economic and socio-demographic variables to examine the determinants of takaful. They found that income, interest rates, financial development, pensions, stocks, price of insurance, life expectancy, dependency ratio, education, and age have positive on determinants of takaful. However, previous tudies have found that inflation, savings, and unemployment rate have negative relationship with the determinant of takaful in Malaysia. This study attempts to examine the determinants of the demand for family takaful and general takaful for comparative study in Malaysia for the period of 1988 to 2010. It employs economic and socio-demographic variables to measure these determinants. Methods- Using time series data, this study applies the Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration to examine the determinants of the demand for family takaful and general takaful in the short and long run. Result- The findings indicate that the economic and socio-demographic variables such as income, and education have positive relationship with the demand for family takaful in the short run, but not in the long run. Conclusion- Meanwhile, it also indicates that income and education have no relationship with demand for general takaful in Malaysia in the short run and long run. It indicates that if there is an increase in income, people tend to buy more family takaful of STMB. At the same time, the educated people already aware of the takaful products, they may necessarily purchase family takaful than life insurance.   Objective – The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the profit distribution method applied in Islamic banks in Indonesia and to propose better method in order to improve sharia risk compliance. Methods – Employing a descriptive quantitative method and literature review. This paper evaluate weaknesses of the current profit distribution method and proposes daily revenue index to solve the problems arising from using current method which is unfairness between bank and customers. Results – By the two current profit distribution methods which use monthly revenue index calculated only at the end of the month, there are potential injustices occur. Therefore, instead of using monthly index, daily index is proposed. There are two steps in calculating profit distribution by using daily revenue index: (1) Accumulating Source of Fund (SoF), Reserve Requirement (RR), and Source of Fund after Reserve Requirement (SoFaRR), and (2) Determining Average Financing (AF), Revenue Index (RI), Cost Index (CI), Revenue Sharing Index (RSI), and Profit Sharing Index (PSI). Conclusion - Daily revenue index will solve the unfairness problems arise from current profit distribution method applied in Islamic banks. Daily revenue index is also applicable if Islamic banks apply profit and loss sharing instead of revenue sharing.   Objective – This study will try to describe inclusive asset building (further abbreviated as IAB) concept which proposed by Michael Sherreden and it’s implementation as the main agenda of ZIS institutions activities. Anti-poverty proposals from various parties include government agencies, private and public, generally focusing on income subsidy policy to encourage public demand over the minimum edge (borderline poverty) of live well. Method - Library research is applied since this paper relies on secondary data by thoroughly reviewing the most relevant literature. This will be elaborated starting from the introduction of mechanisms and IAB programs in the main activities of ZIS institutions. In addition, several prerequisites adjustments and strengthening either in terms of institutional, organizational capacity and management needs to be conducted by the ZIS institutions so that this study will achieve as expected. Results -. Combination of income support with the asset accumulation such as subsidise saving for the poor will be more long-term. Which is expected to help out the poor from socio-economic alienation. Through the implementation of this concept, ZIS institutions have a chance to heighten the leverage of their role in poverty alleviation. Conclution – All resources, either internal and external that have been built by LAZ during these days, is a valuable capital to initiate the paradigm shift. Also, the benefits of institutional characteristics and closely relationship with the clients (mustahik) could be additional notes.   Objective – Islamic finance has been established as an alternative to the conventional banking system which is made up component not permitted under Shariah. Tawarruq is one of the Islamic finance products which commonly used in Islamic banks. This research assesses two important areas which include the principle of Tawarruq in Fiqh perspective and the practical aspect of such principle in Islamic banks in Malaysia. Method – The method used for this research is comparative analysis. Result – This research begins to explore the different views of the proponent and opponents toward the legality of Tawarruq in Fiqh. Instead of considering the basic condition of the valid sale, the other aspect has to be pondered by the contemporary scholars to render Tawarruq is valid sale according to Shariah. The legality of Tawarruq has been debate by some scholars. Due to that, there are different resolution and rulings from Islamic countries on legality of of Tawarruq. In the practical aspect, Tawarruq has been used in Malaysia by Bursa Malaysia Suq Al Sila' as a trading platform and it uses Crude Palm Oil (CPO) as the commodity in Tawarruq transaction. While, in the Middle East, it uses London Metal Exchange (LME) in dealing with commodity transaction through Tawarruq principle. Conclusion – Based on the legal argument on the permissibility of Tawarruq, it can be summarized that Tawarruq is permissible but subject to certain condition. Provided that genuine Tawarruq is permissible than organized Tawarruq in Tawarruq transaction. Keywords: Tawarruq, Murabahah   Objective – This research aimed to analyze zakat calculation practices from online providers. There are some differences in the calculation method, for example different treatment in zakatable deduction, types of income and zakat for business. Methods - Twenty-three zakat online calculators are analyzed and then grouped into a main category. A simulation model is employed by inputting several common assumptions. Results - The results showed that generally three zakat calculator become main providers and differences are still occur. Conclusion – This research showed that the calculation of zakat should be simpler, standardized, and may not cause double zakat counting for profession-zakat. Government should intervene to provide a single zakat calculation method that must be refereed by all zakat institutions and link it to tax system. Keywords: Zakat, accounting, calculation, online   Objective – The objective of this paper is to provide a discussion whether Islamic securities enjoy larger demands than conventional securities. This paper also investigate whether regulator could effectively take a role in materializing demands for Islamic securities and whether regulator declaration is more convincing than sharia compliance declaration by another institution. Methods - We employ differences in differences (DID) regression to see the immediate, medium, and long term market response to this announcement. We also estimate cumulative abnormal returns by employing the standard market model for the robustness test. Results - We find that market reacts to sharia compliance declaration by regulator in the long-run, hence potential demands are realized and the Islamic securities will enjoy greater market power. We also provide evidence that Islamic investors are not too strict in screening Islamic securities and are willing to accept different opinions regarding sharia compliance. Conclusion - This finding could explain why Islamic finance is still growing rapidly even though there are critiques in the genuineness of sharia compliance of the current Islamic financial products/services. Keywords: Regulator, Islamic securities, sharia compliance, demand, investor confidence   7 - 2 - 2012 Objective - The main objective of this study is to estimate the Willingness to Pay of the Muslim households to contribute cash waqf as a strategy towards wealth management in Sri Lanka.

According to the accounting standard in Indonesia, Islamic banks are legally required to report on social aspects. Social reporting is regulated in Indonesia under the accounting standard for Islamic Financial Institutions No. 1. Islamic banks must present social reporting in a standardized format. Methods- The present research methodology analyzes financial reports from Islamic banks between 2006 and 2011. It also analyzes correlated factors based on supporting variables. Results- This research reveals that asset, debt, net income and <b>temporary</b> <b>investment</b> have the highest correlation to social reports by Islamic banks in Indonesia. In addition, older, full-fledged Islamic banks have different characteristics compared to new, full-fledged banks in terms of charity, fines, non-halal funds, and other fund correlations. Conclusion- This research shows that the bigger the bank the bigger social reporting given. In addition, better zakat management is shown by new Islamic bank full fledged group as adaptations in the standard. Keywords: social, report, accounting, Islamic bank</p...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that parents {{with higher levels of}} education generally also attach a higher importance to the education of their children. This implies an intergenerational chain transmitting the attitude towards the formation of human capital {{from one generation to the}} next. We incorporate this intergenerational chain into an OLG-model with endogenous human capital formation. In absence of any state intervention such an economy might be characterized by multiple steady states. A <b>temporary</b> public <b>investment</b> into human capital formation is then needed for a transition from a steady state with low human capital levels to one with a higher human capital level. Furthermore, it can be shown that even the best steady state is suboptimal when the human capital is privately provided. This inefficiency can be overcome by a permanent public subsidy for education. education subsidy; human capital formation; indirect reciprocity...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} model to study {{the impact of the}} 2003 dividend and capital gains tax cuts. In the model, firms are heterogeneous in productivity and make investment and financing decisions subject to capital adjustment costs, equity issuance costs, and collateral constraints. We show that when the dividend and capital gains tax cuts are unexpected and permanent, dividend payments, equity issuance, and aggregate investment rise immediately. By contrast, when these tax cuts are unexpected and <b>temporary,</b> aggregate <b>investment</b> falls in the short run. This fall allows firms to distribute large dividends initially in response to the temporary dividend tax cut. We also find that the effects of a temporary dividend tax cut are very different from those of a temporary capital gains tax cut.

40|$|Long-term {{volcanic}} activity at Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat (1995 –ongoing) has created challenges for {{society and the}} resilience of the essential services (infrastructure) that support it. This paper explores the consequences, adaptations and resilience of essential services through interviews with their staff. We find that quick fixes for essential service reinstatement {{in the north of}} Montserrat have prevailed. Yet, the legacy of this approach inhibits functionality through inadequate facilities and the perception of sites as <b>temporary,</b> stalling <b>investment.</b> Emigration resulted in staff shortages, retraining requirements and challenges for the viability of specialist services. Low-impact hazards exacerbate shortcomings in essential services, causing power cuts, corrosion, and temporary closures of schools, clinics and the airport. Adaptations developed over time include changes to roofing materials, the addition of back-up systems, collaborative working and the development of contingency plans. Resilience of essential services has improved through decentralization, adaptations, and via strong community networks and tolerance of disruptions. Barriers to increasing resilience include the expense of some adaptations and the current reluctance to invest in essential services, hindering development. We offer some lessons for policy and practice to guide post-crisis redevelopment, through engagement with the community and by complementing community-level adaptations with investment to address long-term needs...|$|R
