During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album. She explained how plans for a ballad to be released were put on hold, because a new song she had written [...] "needed to be heard". On June 9, 2009, she wrote on her official Twitter account: [...] "Seriously, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite songs ever. I love the whole album. I'm completely immersed in it. I can't wait for you to hear it", and announced its title as [...] "Obsessed". Later that week, The-Dream, who co-wrote the song with Carey, claimed that the song was definitely aimed at someone in particular, and that it would upset them greatly. The song was transmitted digitally to radio stations on June 16, 2009 for immediate airplay and made its debut on Chicago radio station B96 at 2:00 pm. An official remix of the song, featuring rapper Gucci Mane, premiered on the same day.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good. To get a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} despite [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope" [...] not being [...] "strong" [...] {{as the last}} episode it had [...] "many funny moments scattered throughout" [...] that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E

In Canada, the video premiered on MuchMusic during MuchOnDemand on October 6, 2005, and was added to medium rotation {{a couple of days}} later. Jared Leto told MTV News that [...] "It's the first bestiality footage that you're ever going to see, but it's tastefully done. We're breaking new ground with this one." [...] The music video for the song was filmed during July and August 2005 in an abandoned hotel in Hollywood where the crew encountered prostitutes and drug addicts squatting prior to filming. The crew ended up doing 70 effects shots in 7 days. Throughout the video, effects are greatly used for visual enhancement over bandmembers and around the women depicted. Each frame of the video hides some messages. Fedor explained that was difficult to shoot the video, and commented [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best videos. Every shot in this one is perfect... Look for hidden messages in this one." [...] The video found success on Fuse, mtvU, MTV2 and MuchMusic.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the novel, Richard both pontificates on {{and must}} {{actively}} deal with morality. His first {{reaction to the}} job offer that starts off the plot is objection to its dubious moral standpoint - Zapparoni wants someone to do his dirty work for him in dealing with deserting engineers. His decision to work for Zapparoni, an incredibly powerful man, {{calls into question the}} relationship between power and morality: according to one interpretation, “We come to discover a world where the desperate struggle for survival and success leaves power unmitigated by any recognizable form of morality.” Richard himself suffers insecurity about his morals, wondering if he is being silly for sticking by them in such a world. Late in the novel, Richard proclaims “The moment has now come when I ought to speak of morality. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> weak points: therefore I shall be brief. My unlucky star had destined me to be born when there was much talk about morality and, at the same time, more murders than in any other period...” [...] While the novel doesn’t come to any grand conclusion about morality, it raises questions about whether individual morality is possible within a world determined by power and success, in which the meaning of conventional moral precepts has become as ambiguous as the distinction between natural and artificial.|$|E

"Yes," [...] I retorted, in protest, [...] "but {{this action}} of a closed piano {{happened}} in my presence, under my hand, and there is always so much more convincing quality in the miracle which happens in one's own house.

It happened in the study {{of one of the most}} respected women in the city, a student who did not believe in psychic phenomena. Furthermore, my own hand was on the lid of the piano. I was so convinced of Mrs. Smiley's possession of some occult force that I at once wrote to the society, telling them that a study of her phases would, in my judgment, be the most important work its directors could engage upon. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> crack stories, and I wouldn't believe it as related by any one else.

60|$|With {{the women}} this {{surprised}} me less, as I had already experimented on the sex by going abroad through a suburban part of London simply attired in a sleeve-waistcoat. The result was curious. I then learned {{for the first}} time, and by the exhaustive process, how much attention ladies are accustomed to bestow on all male creatures of their own station; for, in my humble rig, each one who went by me caused me a certain shock of surprise {{and a sense of}} something wanting. In my normal circumstances, it appeared every young lady must have paid me some tribute of a glance; and though I had often not detected it when it was given, I was well aware of its absence when it was withheld. My height seemed to decrease with every woman who passed me, for she passed me like a dog. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grounds for supposing that what are called the upper classes may sometimes produce a disagreeable impression in what are called the lower; and I wish some one would continue my experiment, and find out exactly at what stage of toilette a man becomes invisible to the well-regulated female eye.|$|E

Except in this ignoble and material nineteenth century, men have always worn precious stuffs and beautiful colors as well as women. A hundred years ago a gentleman in pink silk was a gentleman properly dressed. Fifteen hundred years ago the patricians of the classic times wore bracelets exactly like mine. I despise the brutish contempt for beauty and the mean dread of expense which degrade a gentleman's costume to black cloth, and limit a gentleman's ornaments to a finger-ring, in the age I live in. I like to be bright and I beautiful, especially when brightness and beauty come to see me. You don't know how precious your society is to me. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> melancholy days. Tears rise unbidden to my eyes. I sigh and sorrow over myself; I languish for pity. Just think of what I am! A poor solitary creature, cursed with a frightful deformity. How pitiable! how dreadful! My affectionate heart--wasted.

But you're wrong about me, boys. You can't draw me in any game to-night. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> nights off, which I devote exclusively to contemplation and song.
