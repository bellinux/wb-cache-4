5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour for}} Night in the Ruts {{commenced}} shortly thereafter but the band found themselves playing in {{smaller and smaller}} venues <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached bottom when he collapsed on stage during a show in Portland, Maine in 1980 and did not get up {{for the remainder of}} the set. Also in 1980, Aerosmith released its Greatest Hits album. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later and has gone on to become the band's bestselling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies. In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{fashion in}} the mid-1980s became more {{colorful}} around 1984. This included long wool coats, long flared skirts, slim miniskirts, slightly tapered pants and stirrup ones, designer jeans, spandex cycling shorts, extremely long and bulky sweaters, jumpsuits, pastel colors, leather trenchcoats, fur coats, extremely large scarves, beanies, leather gloves, and dresses worn with wide or thin belts. The aerobics craze of the early 1980s continued into the mid 1980s, but the clothes became more colorful <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{their time}} on the island, Babe and Josh become closer <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> They sit by the fire, talk, share a kiss, and later snuggle {{together}} for warmth. Josh reveals to Babe that he loves her and {{wants to be with}} her. But Babe continues to insist that she wants to be with JR; if Josh cannot accept only her friendship, they will have to end their relationship. Josh reluctantly agrees. They are rescued by JR, Jamie, and Julia Santos.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the end for the charity haunts can be traced to a singular event: the Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure) caught fire on the evening of May 11, 1984, in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Eight teenagers lost their lives in the fire. There were criminal charges filed, civil lawsuits, numerous investigations, and the inevitable result that fire safety laws, building codes, and inspections were tightened up considerably nationwide. The net effect was to make charity attractions less economically viable <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> Better construction materials were required, and fire safety equipment was required, making a temporary venue too expensive for many charities to afford. As a result, the larger, better funded for-profit operators moved in as the charities moved out. The fire caused wide-ranging changes for all amusement buildings. Previously, operators were able to avoid fire codes because such attractions were used temporarily. The Haunted Castle fire pointed to an unattractive reality that forced tighter regulation.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night {{was one of the}} focal points of the show, the finals of the 16 team Gran Alternativa tournament. Rey Escorpión showed that he had taken the young rudo Boby Zavala under his wing from the moment they entered the arena, Zavala wore a Rey Escorpión T-shirt and was give his own Los Revolucionarios del Terror (Escorpión's team) Sombrero with his name on the brim of it. The match focuses mainly on the two Novatos Hombre Bala, Jr. and Zavala as they worked hard to show that they had the wrestling skills to work at a higher level <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the tournament. The match went the full three falls. In the closing moments of the match Rey Escorpión {{eliminated}} Hombre Bala, Jr. after he used his signature Aguijón Venenoso ("The Poisoned Stinger") finishing move, also known as a Package piledriver on Bala, Jr. Moments later Boby Zavala landed a splash off the ropes and pinned Atlantis to win the tournament. Following the match the rudo team were presented with trophies as a visual representation of their victory. Afterwards Escorpión touted the values of the Sonora wrestling school that he and Zavala both had trained {{at the beginning of their}} careers.|$|E

25|$|Each Senate {{committee}} and subcommittee {{is led by}} a chair (usually {{a member of the}} majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility. Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage {{on the floor of the}} full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> reform. The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member. In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.|$|E
500|$|Griffiths first {{recorded}} {{small groups of}} pupils and then invited more in, telling them to affect a Cockney accent and shout rather than sing. He multitracked the voices, making the groups sound much larger <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>before</b> sending his recordings back to Los Angeles. The result was that Waters was [...] "beaming", and the song was released, becoming a Christmas number one hit. There was some controversy when the British press reported that the children had not been paid for their efforts; they were eventually given copies of the album, and the school received a £1,000 donation (£ in contemporary value).|$|E
500|$|Two film {{industry}} trade journals gave the film positive reviews. Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Adamson's direction had a [...] "surer sense of cinematic values" [...] and praised the improved special effects, the [...] "timeless" [...] locations and production design. On the performances, he felt [...] "the four kids overall have more character {{and are therefore}} more interesting to watch <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before,</b> and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that's implacable but not overplayed." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted the film was darker than its predecessor, with [...] "the loss of innocence theme ... significantly deepened". He highlighted Peter Dinklage's performance, which [...] "outmaneuver the title character as Narnia's most colorful new inhabitant";.|$|E

500|$|For a {{few months}} {{following}} Peterloo it seemed to the authorities {{that the country was}} heading towards an armed rebellion. Encouraging them in that belief were two abortive uprisings, in Huddersfield and Burnley, during the autumn of 1819, and the discovery and foiling of the Cato Street conspiracy to blow up the cabinet that winter. By the end of the year, the government had introduced legislation, later known as the Six Acts, to suppress radical meetings and publications, {{and by the end of}} 1820 every significant working-class radical reformer was in jail; civil liberties had declined to an even lower level <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> Peterloo. Historian Robert Reid has written that [...] "it is not fanciful to compare the restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Peterloo period in the early nineteenth century with those of the black South African in the post-Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century".|$|E

[...] In an experiment by Fischhoff in 1975, adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard information on actual outcome. Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others' thinking, adults can be unable to disregard certain information {{that they have been}} given.|$|E
50|$|A {{price floor}} set above the market {{equilibrium}} price has several side-effects. Consumers find they must now pay {{a higher price}} for the same product.

40|$|Vowel {{duration}} {{measurements were}} made from the sound spectrographic patterns of normal and whispered consonant-vowel-consonant syllables produced by three male speakers. It {{was found that the}} average duration of whispered vowels was longer than that of normal vowels. Like normal vowels, whispered vowels can be grouped according to four degrees of length: Iong-/le, a, J/, relatively long-/e, 3, o /, relatively short-/i, u/, and short-/r, E, A, u/.
