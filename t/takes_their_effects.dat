40|$|AbstractThe {{musculoskeletal}} system of vertebrates {{is derived from}} the embryonic mesoderm. Its structures are categorized as epaxial or hypaxial based on their adult position and innervation. The epaxial/hypaxial terminology is also used to describe regions of the embryonic somites based on fate mapping of somitic derivatives. However, the adult, functional distinctions are not fully consistent with the changing embryonic environments of mesodermal populations during morphogenesis, and the traditional terminology loses accuracy when used to describe certain mutant phenotypes. Here we describe a new terminology naming two mesodermal environments defined by the lineage of the included cells. We discuss how mutant phenotypes may be better explained by consideration of the embryonic context in which genes <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> and argue that the recognition of these embryonic territories clarifies description and discussion of the morphogenesis and patterning of the {{musculoskeletal system}}...|$|R

The complex electromagnetic behaviors of these often complicated structures must be characterized in order to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> into account. Broadband macromodeling deals with the generation of network models of these devices in order to accurately predict their behaviors in circuit simulators. This often involves the generation of passive rational function representations of the system from the measured port responses. In this thesis, we will employ the vector fitting algorithm to generate a rational function representation of the system along with its state space model. Various issues on the subject will be discussed, including the recently developed fast fitting method for multiport devices. Passivity of the model, {{which is one of}} the most prominent issues on the subject, will be addressed. A robust algorithm, via residue perturbation, to enforce passivity in nonpassive models will be presented. Finally, numerical results will be presented to demonstrate the performance of the overall process...|$|R

50|$|During {{the period}} of the 'Great War', the Mennonites in Russia were well {{advanced}} socially and economically. Many large agricultural estates and business entities were controlled by Mennonite interests. They had a reputation for outstanding efficiency and quality and were noted across Russia for their agricultural and organizational abilities. The precedent of non-resistant national service had been established years before and the Mennonites therefore had a system to handle military service requests at the outbreak of war. During World War I, 5000 Mennonite men served in both forestry and hospital units and transported wounded from the battlefield to Moscow and Ekaterinoslav hospitals. The Mennonite congregations were responsible for funding these forms of alternative service, as well as supporting the men's families during their absence, a burden of 3.5 million rubles annually. During this time there was a progressive breakdown in the autonomy of the Mennonite colonies and social and financial pressure began to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> on the Mennonite people and their institutions. Property and possessions began to be confiscated for the war effort and certain industrial complexes turned to military production (some voluntary). Much of the Mennonite hope at that time was based on the preservation of the existing Russian Provisional Government. However, as the war progressed, the social tide turned against the existing power structure and Russia began a march toward structural discord.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practices}} and discourses of groups and networks supporting migrants {{in the context}} of the construction of the European Union (EU) and the Europeanisation of immigration and border controls. Its main objectives are: (1) to engage in critical examination of the European political project and the discourse of European belonging that has sustained its construction and consolidation; (2) to observe whether novel contentious practices have emerged to respond to multi-scalar developments associated with harmonisation of immigration-related policies; and (3) to investigate narratives of pro-migrant groups and networks. The project mobilises ethnographic research focused on pro-migrant organisations and networks in three European Union member states: France, Italy and the United Kingdom. It analyses testimony from participants involved in solidarity initiatives and assesses their perspectives on Europe and European belonging. This study draws on insights from a range of disciplines including Political Science, International Relations, Security Studies, Historical Sociology and Migration Studies. It embraces an historical approach to European construction and an analysis of global influences upon the development of the EU. It addresses the tensions and conflicts that arise when national, supranational and global processes <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> upon the European project, and the specific impacts in the area of migration and bordering. This project concludes that a transnational pro-migrant movement is in formation in the EU. It is characterised by intensified cooperation and communication across borders, the development of new crossborder activist tools and tactics, increasingly complex transnational networks and the formulation of a mutually comprehensible analysis of the EU border regime. Yet this movement-in-formation has not been articulated and integrated around alternative visions of Europe and European identity. I argue that this is due to tensions and contradictions generated by the European project and I develop a critical reflection about processes of European construction and the production of ideas about Europ...|$|R
