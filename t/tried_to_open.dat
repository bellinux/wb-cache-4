5|$|A 800–1,000-strong Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of Tampere and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand's opponents, under Piccinino's main command, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> {{battle with}} Skanderbeg, {{but due to}} the {{combined}} strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces, they withdrew from the Andrian fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti. News of Piccinino's retreat reached Venice who {{sent a message to}} Francisco Sforza. Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto, where Giovanni Orsini was prince. Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him, but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini's faithfulness, so Skanderbeg continued raiding Orsini's territory. He split his army into three parts, one under Moisi Arianit Golemi, the other under Vladan Gjurica, and the last under his command. He led attacks against Ferdinand's enemies in three directions without halt, thoroughly exhausting them. During the month of October, Skanderbeg continued to pillage Orisini's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in Calabria, where he recaptured Cosenza and Castrovillari. At this point, Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected. On 27 October, Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of Gisualdo. Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted, believing that peace was near.|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
25|$|After a quiet Fourth of July the employers' organization, the Industrial Association, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> {{the port}} even further on Thursday, July 5. As spectators watched from Rincon Hill, the police shot tear gas {{canisters}} into the crowd, then {{followed with a}} charge by mounted police. Picketers threw the canisters and rocks back at the police, who charged again, sending the picketers into retreat. Each side then refortified and took stock.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the present}} form of the tale (dating to the Edo period), Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach which was found {{floating}} down a river, by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the peach to eat it. The child explained {{that he had been}} sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from momo (peach) and tarō (eldest son in the family).|$|E
25|$|A force shaped {{around the}} tanks of Company C {{led the way}} toward Sinch'on. But after seven miles (11km), as Bowen's column moved through a system of ridges, {{landslides}} twice trapped the leading tanks, {{and in the second}} instance no bypass could be found. As engineers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the road, rain began to fall and became steadily heavier. With the rain making a poor road even worse, Bowen ordered the tanks back to Munsan-ni. After the engineers had cleared the road sufficiently, his remaining forces proceeded to Sinch'on, arriving about 06:00 on March 25.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of HMS Thetis, 4 members of the ship’s company, three RN {{personnel}} (Lieutenant Woods, Captain Oram and Leading Stoker Arnold) and one Cammell Laird’s employee (Fitter Shaw) successfully used the escape chamber. During the 5th attempt to escape the occupant of the chamber panicked and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the outer escape hatch before the chamber had completely flooded. As a result, the increased pressure outside the submarine caused an in-rush of sea water, thus drowning the escapee. Because the outer escape hatch remained partially open it rendered the escape chamber inoperative, preventing the escape of any other crew members.|$|E

25|$|The Kirkuk {{production}} averaged 4 {{million tons}} per year until World War II, when restricted shipping in the Mediterranean forced down the production sharply. Although the Iraq Government <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up the country to competition, the company taking up the new concession was bought out by IPC and, {{under the name of}} the Mosul Petroleum Company, was duly gathered into the IPC 'family' of associated companies (see below). The company also got the concession rights to southern Iraq in 1938, and founded the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC) as their wholly owned subsidiary to develop the southern region of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} Ljubljana, he became {{involved}} {{with a group of}} young intellectuals, known as the Critical generation, which <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the Titoist regime in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Among Pučnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian Taras Kermauner, sociologist Veljko Rus, and poet Veno Taufer. Pučnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the Communist Party of Slovenia. At the same time, he published several articles in the Revija 57 magazine, in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the Communist regime.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E

25|$|Kuber and {{his people}} moved {{as far as the}} region of Thessaloniki. He decided to settle {{together}} with the Sermesianoi in a plain and sent his envoy to the Byzantine Emperor, whom the Miracles of Saint Demetrios did not name, to request his permission. The emperor gave his consent and ordered the nearby Slavic tribe of the Dragovites to supply Kuber {{and his people}} with food. However, Kuber's people still {{wanted to go back to}} their ancestral homes and started to disperse. Fearing of the decline of his power base, Kuber asked the emperor to forbid the Sermesianoi to leave the plain and to confirm Kuber's position as their ruler. His request seems to have been rejected, because he attempted to seize Thessaloniki, taking advantage of a civil war in the city. However, Saint Demetrius unmasked Kuber's agents who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the gates of Thessaloniki, hindering him from entering the city, according to the saint's hagiography.|$|E
25|$|Ponting {{was in a}} rich vein of form {{against the}} South Africans. After scoring 71 and 53 in the drawn First Test in Perth, Ponting scored 117 on Boxing Day in the Second Test at the MCG. Australia won the match and Ponting scored 120 and 143 not out to end the series and start the New Year with a {{dramatic}} win in the Third Test at the SCG. South African captain Graeme Smith declared on the final morning of a rain-curtailed match and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up the game {{in a bid to}} equal the series. He left Australia a target of 287 runs in 76 overs, and Ponting made 143 not out in only 159 balls to secure an eight-wicket win. It was the first time anyone had scored two centuries in their 100th Test and Ponting was named man of the match and man of the series. He had scored 515 runs at 103.00.|$|E
25|$|The city's fortifications were strong, {{with a wide}} moat and a {{thick wall}} {{protected}} by 44 towers, according to the contemporary geographer Ibn Khordadbeh, and the caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls. Both besiegers and besieged had many siege engines, and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls. According to Arab accounts, an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph, and informed him about {{a place in the}} wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander's negligence. As a result, the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section. The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock, but they splintered, and after two days a breach was made. The Arabs now launched repeated attacks on the breach, with Afshin, Ashinas, and Itakh taking turns in leading their men in attack, but the defenders held firm. In the event, the city fell by treachery in mid-August, when the Byzantine officer commanding the breach <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up separate negotiations with al-Mu'tasim, and the Abbasids used the lull in order to launch a surprise attack.|$|E

500|$|When Werbin {{finished}} graduate school, {{he looked}} for business opportunities and decided to use his knowledge of used guitars. He searched for vintage instruments to buy at low prices, particularly those made before World War II; Werbin then sold the instruments after repairing and restoring them. Although he initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> his business in Ann Arbor, Werbin eventually decided to avoid operating there due to {{the high number of}} other musical instrument dealers. In 1972, Werbin and Sharon McInturff, his college friend and business partner, leased retail space in East Lansing, Michigan for $60 a month in a building that also housed the Michigan Youth Politics Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging young adults to vote. With $500 of capital, the two began advertising locally.
