40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{evaluated}} the antioxidant activities of <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> in scavenging 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydroxyl radical (DPPH) and in suppressing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation, {{as a marker}} of lipid oxidation, in African breadfruit seed dhal and flour. Water and ethanol extracts of <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> at different concentrations were used to scavenge DPPH radical. Parboiled (100 °C; 15 min) breadfruit seeds were dehulled to seed dhal, oven-dried (50 °C; 72 h), {{and half of the}} dhal milled into flour. Samples (100 g each) of the seed dhal and flour added and mixed together with aqueous suspensions (0, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 or 5. 0 g per 5 ml water) of <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> were analysed for TBA values within 4 months of storage at 26 ± 2 °C. The water and ethanol extracts scavenged DPPH in a dose-dependent manner. The ethanol extract had IC 50 of 38. 17 while the water extract had IC 50 of 7. 32, indicating much higher antioxidant activity of water extract. <b>Tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> inhibited lipid oxidation in breadfruit seed dhal and flour as evident from the mean thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value which decreased with increasing concentrations of the fruit pulp. Antioxidant activity of the fruit pulp was higher in the flour than in the dhal within 4 months of storage. Both seed dhal and flour treated with <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> had lower mean TBA values ranging from 2. 80 to 4. 12 ppm Malonaldehyde as against 4. 55 to 4. 91 ppm for untreated samples. Tamarind fruit can thus be further studied for possible exploitation as a natural antioxidant for use in food, drug and cosmetic products...|$|R

Total phenolic, anthocyanins, yellow flavonoids, β-carotene and lycopene levels were also determined. Resveratrol was identified in guava and surinam cherry by-products and coumarin in passion fruit, guava and surinam cherry by-products and mango pulp. These fruit pulp and by-products could be considered a new natural source of both compounds. Overall, fruit by-products presented higher (P< 0. 05) bioactive content than their respective fruit pulps.

40|$|Tamarind (Tamarindus indica, Fabaceae), a {{tropical}} fruit found in Africa and Asia is highly valued for its <b>pulp.</b> <b>Tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> has a sweet acidic taste {{due to a}} combination of high contents of tartaric acid and reducing sugars. The pulp is used for seasoning, in prepared foods, to flavour confections, curries and sauces, and as a major ingredient in juices and other beverages. Commercial tamarind-based drinks are available from many countries. Vitamin B content is quite high; carotene and vitamin C contents are low. Presence of tannins and other dyeing matters in the seed testa make the whole seed unsuitable for consumption, but they become edible after soaking and boiling in water. Tamarind kernel powder is an important sizing material in textile, paper and juteindustries. Seeds are gaining importance as an alternative source of proteins, and are besides rich in some essential minerals. Seed pectin can form gels over a wide pH range. Leaves and flowers can be eaten as vegetables, and are prepared in a variety of dishes. They are used to make curries, salads, stews and soups. Tamarind leaves are a fair source of vitamin C and α-carotene; mineral content is high, particularly P, K, Ca and Mg. Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-fungal activity has been documented from several plant parts. Tamarind is also extensively used in traditional medicine.

40|$|The {{tamarind}} (Tamarindus indica L) is {{indigenous to}} Asian countries and widely cultivated in the American continents. The <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> extract (ExT), traditionally used in spices, food components and juices, {{is rich in}} polyphenols that have demonstrated anti-atherosclerotic, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. This study evaluated the modulator effect of a crude hydroalcoholic ExT on some peripheral human neutrophil functions. The neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation, triggered by opsonized zymosan (OZ), n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and assessed by luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (LumCL and LucCL, respectively), was inhibited by ExT in a concentration-dependent manner. ExT was a more effective inhibitor of the PMA-stimulated neutrophil function [IC(50) (in mu g/ 10 (6) cells) = 115. 7 +/- 9. 7 (LumCL) and 174. 5 +/- 25. 9 (LucCL) ], than the OZ- [IC(50) = 248. 5 +/- 23. 1 (LumCL) and 324. 1 +/- 34. 6 (LucCL) ] or fMLP-stimulated cells [IC(50) = 178. 5 +/- 12. 2 (LumCL) ]. The ExT also inhibited neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity (evaluated by O(2) consumption), degranulation and elastase activity (evaluated by spectrophotometric methods) at concentrations higher than 200 mu g/ 10 (6) cells, without being toxic to the cells, under the conditions assessed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tamarindus indica (T. indica) is a {{medicinal}} plant with many biological activities including anti-diabetic, hypolipidaemic and anti-bacterial activities. A recent study demonstrated the hypolipidaemic effect of T. indica fruit pulp in hamsters. However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms {{responsible for these}} effects have not been fully elucidated. Hence, the aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the antioxidant activities and potential hypocholesterolaemic properties of T. indica, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The in vitro study demonstrated that T. indica fruit pulp had significant amount of phenolic (244. 9 ± 10. 1 mg GAE/extract) and flavonoid (93. 9 ± 2. 6 mg RE/g extract) content and possessed antioxidant activities. In the in vivo study, hamsters fed with high-cholesterol diet for ten weeks showed elevated serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C levels. Administration of T. indica fruit pulp to hypercholesterolaemic hamsters significantly lowered serum triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels but had no effect on the HDL-C level. The lipid-lowering effect was accompanied with significant increase in the expression of Apo A 1, Abcg 5 and LDL receptor genes and significant decrease in the expression of HMG-CoA reductase and Mtp genes. Administration of T. indica fruit pulp to hypercholesterolaemic hamsters also protected against oxidative damage by increasing hepatic antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant activities and preventing hepatic lipid peroxidation. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: It is postulated that <b>tamarind</b> fruit <b>pulp</b> exerts its hypocholesterolaemic effect by increasing cholesterol efflux, enhancing LDL-C uptake and clearance, suppressing triglyceride accumulation and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. T. indica fruit pulp has potential antioxidative effects and is potentially protective against diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia...|$|R

To determine the in vitro digestibility (IV D) of nutrients, two sheep, weighing 40. 38 ± 2. 10 kg, were used as inoculum donors. To determine the in vivo digestibility of nutrients, we used four sheep and a 3 × 2 factorial experimental design, with three methods of digestion of nutrients and two experimental rations (0 % and 15 % RETP). The variables were subjected to analysis of variance and the variables that showed differences at 5 % probability were further analyzed using the Tukey test at 5 % significance. The IV D using different inocula did not significantly differ (p> 0. 05) from the in vivo digestibility in sheep for dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The different methods for determining nutrient digestibility did not affect (p> 0. 05) the digestibility of DM, OM, crude protein (CP), NDF, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in rations with 0 % and 15 % RETP. However, the IV D of CP for rations containing 0 % and 15 % RETP incubated with both inocula was lower (p 0. 05) for the rations containing 0 % and 15 % RETP, but the pH and NH 3 -N of both fermented and rumen contents differed (p< 0. 05) depending on the inocula used and the in vivo assay. In summary, the digestibility of DM, OM, and NDF can be determined by the in vitro fermentation method using the ruminal fluid or feces of sheep as inocula in rations containing 0 % or 15 % RETP. However, in vitro fermentation is not a suitable method for the determination of pH and NH 3 -N concentration. </p...|$|E
