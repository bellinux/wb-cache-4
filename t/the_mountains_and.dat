At their meeting, Boricius and his subjects were baptized and acknowledged Béla's suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.|$|E

Thoros fled into <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> <b>and</b> Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E

The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna Canyon and the San Diego Creek watershed is very small, allowing for the canyon's modern use as a transportation route.|$|E

The next stage was marked {{by the appearance of}} the major mountains and by Pondenzana conceding the maglia rosa to Franco Chioccioli. The ensuing stages saw the general classification shift more frequently due to the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>and</b> fatigue.|$|E
