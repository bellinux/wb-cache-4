50|$|Shortly after ignition, {{at about}} 60,000 feet (18 km), the craft {{unexpectedly}} rolled 90 {{degrees to the}} left, due to wind shear. When the pilot attempted to correct it, it rolled 90 degrees to the right. The pilot levelled the craft out, and proceeded with the climb. The correction of the roll excursion, using full trim, caused a pitch trim tab to run up against a stop. This caused the <b>trim</b> <b>actuator,</b> as designed, to stop operating for a 3 s timeout. Not realising what had happened, the pilot and controllers interpreted this as failure of the <b>trim</b> <b>actuator,</b> and they switched to a backup system. Spacecraft attitude was problematic during the entire climb, and not corrected until the start of re-entry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{results of}} the {{certification}} review, released on 12 September 2008, indicated that the certification process was valid, but that the FAA and Eclipse Aviation [...] "should conduct a root cause analysis" [...] of the owner-reported problems with the aircraft's trim, <b>trim</b> <b>actuator</b> and fire-extinguisher systems. Further report recommendations addressed internal FAA processes that were not optimally handled.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight control}} system {{operates}} a set of conventional flight control surfaces with a rigid push-rod transmission system, which itself is electrically or hydraulically operated. The aileron control system, of irreversible servo-control type, is composed of a hydraulic booster, an artificial-feel device, a feel <b>trim</b> <b>actuator</b> and a rigid push-rod transmission mechanism. The elevator and rudder control systems are of reversible push-rod type.|$|E
40|$|The present work applies a {{recently}} developed method 1 to compute, {{by means of}} coupled CFD/CSD simulations, the shaft angle corrections for closed section wind tunnel tests on trimmed isolated rotor configurations. A complete simulation of the rotor flow field in free-flight is performed, and the power coefficient C P is extracted. Then a set of simulations of the same rotor at the same trim state is performed in the closed section of Politecnico di Milano large wind tunnel at different shaft angles. The power coefficient is extracted from each simulation in order to evaluate the shaft angle which matches the C P value obtained in free-flight. The computations are performed using a <b>trimmed</b> <b>actuator</b> disc model with non uniform source distribution, coupling the CFD code ROSITA with the CSD code MBDyn. The methodology is applied spanning the available tunnel velocity range. Two different rotor trim conditions are evaluated: zero flapping angle trim and shaft, moment trim. The achieved corrections for the two trimming options are compared and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The control {{loading system}} must take in inputs from the {{simulator}} and pilot and provide outputs {{for the pilot}} and simulator. Inputs are application of force and aircraft states and outputs are flight control position and forces.An aircraft with reversible controls needs {{to have all of}} the complex components modeled within the control loading system. These include cables, rods, aero forces from the control surface, centering springs and <b>trim</b> <b>actuators.</b> As the control system gets more complicated they have to simulate effects such as bob-weights and feel units. Fly-by-wire systems are disconnected from the control surfaces and so do not need the complex features but add other functionality which is simulated.The high fidelity architecture has centralized control, individual analog signals to the control module, a brushless DC motor with low gear ratio and linkages to the pilot controls.The modular designs have localized control and digital reporting over a field bus to the central control module. The control loading systems are designed to allow situating the actuators closer to the pilot. This is necessary for mission training systems that can be easily deployed and moved around the world.|$|R
5000|$|November 1963: Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 831 - All 118 {{on board}} a Trans-Canada Airlines DC-8-54F were killed, when the plane crashed 5 minutes after takeoff near Montreal, leaving a crater in the ground. Impact speed was over 500 mph. They found the pitch <b>trim</b> {{compensator}} <b>actuator</b> was in the extended position and the horizontal stabilizer trim setting was at 1.65 to 2 degrees nosedown (both were improper positions, for that stage of flight). [...] "The probable cause of this accident could not be determined with certainty. Certain possible causes which were put forward could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the Pitot system; 2) Failure of the vertical gyro; 3) An unprogrammed and unnoticed extension of the pitch trim compensator." ...|$|R

Get in TrimThis episode {{sees the}} {{building}} gathering pace as Mark installs the cockpit module and seats into the aeroplane {{as well as}} the <b>trim</b> tabs and <b>actuator</b> into the tail plane. In our regular look at the world of kit aircraft, we meet Steve Pike and Kevin Fagan who have just finished an Australian aircraft - The Jabiru. Back at Staverton Airport, it's a milestone in Mark's Flying progress - with his first solo flight.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in solar sails as an alternative means of space propulsion. Many different attitude control systems have been designed for Solar Sails {{taking advantage of the}} centre-of-mass(cm) /centre-of- pressure(cp) offset. Most of these proposed systems are at best theoretical and have not been demonstrated. In this paper we build upon a previous proposed scalable bus-based attitude control system for solar sails, which utilised a <b>trim</b> control mass <b>actuator</b> to change the centre of mass and highly reective panels to create a windmill torque, achieving 3 -axis control. As part of testing the proposed system, we have built and demonstrated a trim control mass actuation mechanism for solar sails, taking advantage of an air-bearing table to achieve a virtually frictionless attitude test environment. This is the first known attempt at construction and demonstration of a solar sail attitude control system based on the change in the cm with respect to the cp. In this paper we seek to investigate the control algorithms involved and the obstacles concerned in building a <b>trim</b> control mass <b>actuator</b> for a solar sail.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel scheme capable of controlling deflection shapes of laminated beam plates without relying on information of external loads and boundary conditions. Layers of piezoelectric sensors and <b>actuators</b> <b>trimmed</b> to sine shapes {{are embedded in}} the laminated beam plate. An adaptive control algorithm is used for achieving expected control effects. Theoretical simulation is formulated and performed to demonstrate its feasibility. Fourier sine series incorporated with Stokes transformation is employed for the simulation of beam-plate deflections. Clamped-clamped and simply supported beam plates are used for illustrative purposes. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} scheme is effective...|$|R
