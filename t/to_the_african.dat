40|$|A ZBTE journal article. There is {{disagreement}} between colonial and post-colonial Africanist historiographies on Africa {{over the role}} of missionaries in Africa especially their provision of education <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> prior and during colonization.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} explored ethnic stereotypes, {{levels of}} blatant/subtle prejudice toward <b>Africans</b> and <b>the</b> relationships {{between these two}} dimensions in Italian university {{students with and without}} friends belonging to other ethnic groups. The ethnic traits and jobs choice (De Caroli & Sagone, 2007) and the Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale (Pettigrew & Meertens, 1995) were used. Results showed that most of the students attributed positive traits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> and negative traits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italians, and assigned prestigious-intellectual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italians and practical-manual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Africans.</b> University students with both low levels of blatant prejudice and high levels of subtle prejudice (Subtles) assigned more prestigious-intellectual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italians and practical-manual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> than <b>the</b> others (Equalitarians).

5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E
5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of the slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E

5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{occur in}} sub-Saharan Africa. The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius. It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius. P. b. borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, although there are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory, with the martins moving to lower ground or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> mainland outside the breeding season. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Most lions {{now live}} in eastern and {{southern}} Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30–50% decline per 20 years in the late {{half of the twentieth}} century. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004, down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered the most significant threats to the species. The remaining populations are often geographically isolated from one another, which can lead to inbreeding, and consequently, reduced genetic diversity. The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from those of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850–1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. Another population in northwestern Africa is found in Waza National Park, where approximately 14–21 animals persist. Therefore, the lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Asiatic subspecies is endangered. However, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> lion, the Asiatic lion's number has risen over the years.|$|E

The 7th Infantry Division began rigorous amphibious assault training under US Marines from the Fleet Marine Force, before being deployed to fight in the Pacific theater instead of Africa. USMC General Holland Smith oversaw the unit's training.|$|E

5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers.

5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} jackal {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is not closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden wolf, and Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray wolf and the African golden wolf.
