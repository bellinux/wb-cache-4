40|$|Human interleukin- 11 (hIL- 11) is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine {{administered to}} patients with low platelet counts. From a structural point of view hIL- 11 belongs to the long-helix cytokine superfamily, which {{is characterized by a}} conserved core motif consisting of four α-helices. We have investigated the region of hIL- 11 that does not belong to the α-helical bundle motif, and that for the purpose of brevity we have termed “non-core region. ” The primary sequence of the interleukin was altered at various locations within <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> region by introducing glycosylation sites. Functional consequences of these modifications were examined in cell-based as well as biophysical assays. Overall, the data indicated that <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> region modulates <b>the</b> function of hIL- 11 in two ways. First, the majority of muteins displayed enhanced cell-stimulatory properties (superagonist behavior) in a glycosylation-dependent manner, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> region is biologically designed to limit the full potential of hIL- 11. Second, specific modification of a predicted mini α-helix led to cytokine inactivation, demonstrating that this putative structural element belongs to site III engaging a second copy of cell-receptor gp 130. These findings have unveiled new and unexpected elements modulating the biological activity of hIL- 11, which may be exploited to develop more versatile medications based on this important cytokine...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} for modeling prosody patterns of acoustic features of Chinese expressive speech. In a Chinese multi-syllabic prosodic word, a syllable {{is identified as}} the core syllable based on the observation that speaker usually puts more emphasis on such syllable. The variations of the acoustic fea-tures migrating from neutral to expressive speech are then ana-lyzed for both <b>the</b> core and <b>non-core</b> syllables. It is found that the acoustic variations of the core syllable are the most signif-icant; the variations of <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> syllables {{are influenced by the}} core syllable; such influence decreases while <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> syllable moves farther from the core syllable. A double-layer perturbation model is then proposed to model such prosody pat-terns, which is further applied to generate personalized prosody patterns for personalized speech conversion. Experimental re-sults indicate that our model can catch and regenerate the per-sonality of prosodic features in expressive speech.

In mice lacking <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> domain of RAG 2 the ordered rearrangement is disturbed and direct V to D rearrangements are 10 - to 1000 -times increased in tri-partite immune gene loci. Some forms of inter-chromosomal translocations between TCRβ and TCRδ D gene segments are also increased in the core RAG 2 animals as compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In addition, the concise use of proper recombination signal sequences (RSSs) appears to be disturbed in the core RAG 2 mice as compared with WT RAG 2 animals...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{workings}} of internal capital markets in diversified firms that engage in related and unrelated corporate acquisitions. Our evidence indicates that bidders invest outside their core business (diversify) when the cash flows of their core business fall behind those of their non-core lines of business. However, bidders invest inside their core business (i. e., undertake non-diversifying investments) when their core business experiences superior cash flows. We also find that bidders whose core business are in industries with low growth prospects engage in diversifying acquisitions while bidders whose core business are in high growth industries undertake non-diversifying acquisitions. The pre-acquisition evidence, then, suggests that firms tend to diversify when the cash flows and the growth opportunities of their core business are considerably {{lower than those of}} their non-core business. Subsequent to acquisitions we find that diversifying bidders continue to allocate financial resources from less profitable business segments (i. e., core business) to more profitable business <b>segments</b> (i. e., <b>non-core</b> business). Given <b>the</b> low profitability of diversifying bidders' core business, this capital resource allocation suggests that diversification increases do not result in capital allocation inefficiencies. The evidence for non-diversifying bidders, however, supports the existence of "corporate socialism" in the sense that there is transfer of funds from the profitable (core) to <b>the</b> less profitable (<b>non-core)</b> business <b>segments</b> in multi-segment bidders. We find that the capital expenditures of bidders' <b>non-core</b> business <b>segments</b> rely on both core and non-core cash flows. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{whether the}} {{organizational}} structure of firms (i. e., whether a firm is diversified or focused) affects their cash holdings. Using Compustat firm level and segment-level data, {{we find that}} diversified firms hold significantly less cash than their focused counterparts. Our results are robust to industry adjustments at the segment level and to different factors previously found to be important determinants of cash holdings. Using time-series, cross-sectional, and additional robustness tests {{we are able to}} attribute the lower cash holdings among diversified firms to complementary growth opportunities across the different segments of these firms and the availability of active internal capital markets. We find that the other theories that rely on the potentially effective use of asset sales of <b>non-core</b> <b>segments</b> of diversified firms to generate cash, and the increased agency/influence costs in diversified firms do not offer an economically significant explanation for the lower cash holdings among diversified firms.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of the {{monetary}} integration on different types of stock returns in Europe. In order to isolate European factors, {{the impact of}} global equity integration and small cap factors are investigated. European countries are sub-divided according to the process of monetary convergence. Analysis shows that national equity indices are strongly influenced by global market movements, with a European stock factor providing additional explanatory power. The global and European factors explain small cap and real estate stocks much less well –suggesting an increased importance of ‘local’ drivers. For real estate, there are notable differences between core and non-core countries. Core European countries exhibit convergence – a convergence to a European rather than a global factor. <b>The</b> <b>non-core</b> countries do not seem to exhibit common trends or movements. For <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> countries, monetary integration has been associated with increased dispersion of returns, lower correlation and lower explanatory power of a European factor. It is concluded that this may be explained by divergence in underlying macro-economic drivers between core and <b>non-core</b> countries in <b>the</b> post-Euro period. ...|$|R

50|$|The Survey Corps {{was subject}} to many Government and Defence reviews since the 1950s, with seven from the early 1980s. Review {{outcomes}} led to many reorganisations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s efficiency reviews led to an Army direction that <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> strategic mapping functions of the Corps were to be tested {{as part of the}} Defence Commercial Support Program. Army decisions as part of that review were that: the combat support survey force (1st Topographical Survey Squadron) would be increased significantly; <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> work, mainly systematic mapping of Australia would be performed by a new Army agency with civilian personnel; and, that the core strategic mapping would be retained by Army until it could be transferred to Defence Intelligence. This last component was achieved in 2000 when the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (now Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation) was formed. These changes meant that the majority of Survey Corps staff positions would be removed, and so in September 1995 the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) decided that the remaining combat support force and training force functions of the Corps would be once again integrated with the combat force and training force of the Royal Australian Engineers.|$|R
