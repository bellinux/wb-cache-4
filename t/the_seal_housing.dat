40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of reciprocating hydraulic seals radically decreased {{the efficiency and}} immensely reduced <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> volumes and also the overall economy of high pressure hydraulic drives. To reveal tribological behaviour of reciprocating seals {{it is necessary to}} analyse the relationships of seal design, tribological features and the main operating characteristics. For environmental protection leakage control has great importance. Leakage calculation of reciprocating high pressure hydraulic seals is based on the sealing pressure distribution profiles, i. e. diagrams which are playing an important role in research and {{development of}} piston and piston rod seals too. Key words: tribology of seals, reciprocating hydraulic seals, piston and piston rod seals, efficiency of friction seals, seal design. 1...|$|E
40|$|Brush seals are {{comprised}} of fine diameter fibers densely packed between retaining and backing plates. To achieve seal compliance bristles {{are arranged to}} contact rotor with some lay angle. When axial pressure load is applied, bristles interlock and get stuck at the backing plate, and seal stiffness varies under operating conditions. Operating stiffness is critical to determine seal-rotor contact pressure and wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved shoe to brush bore as reported in open literature. Due to the complex nature of pressure-stiffness bristle behavior, static and unpressurized measurements cannot represent actual working seal stiffness. This work presents a brush seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring seal stiffness under working pressure and speed conditions. Rotor speed is achieved by an integrated spindle drive, while contact forces are measured via sensitive load cells. Rotor excursions are applied through lateral motions of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> that is actuated by a motorized linear slide. Stiffness testing methodology and calibration procedure are discussed. Comparative experimental data are presented for both static pressurized and dynamic-pressurized stiffness tests...|$|E

40|$|Vibration dampers {{have been}} invented that are {{incorporated}} as components within the stationary labyrinth seal assembly. These dampers {{are intended to}} supplement other vibration-suppressing features of labyrinth seals {{in order to reduce}} the incidence of high-cycle-fatigue failures, which have been known to occur in the severe vibratory environments of jet engines and turbopumps in which labyrinth seals are typically used. A vibration damper of this type includes several leaf springs and/or a number of metallic particles (shot) all held in an annular seal cavity by a retaining ring. The leaf springs are made of a spring steel alloy chosen, in conjunction with design parameters, to maintain sufficient preload to ensure effectiveness of damping at desired operating temperatures. The cavity is vented via a small radial gap between the retaining ring and seal housing. The damping mechanism is complex. In the case of leaf springs, the mechanism is mainly friction in the slippage between <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> and individual dampers. In the case of a damper that contains shot, the damping mechanism includes contributions from friction between individual particles, friction between particles and cavity walls, and dissipation of kinetic energy of impact. The basic concept of particle/shot vibration dampers has been published previously; what is new here is the use of such dampers to suppress traveling-wave vibrations in labyrinth seals. Damping effectiveness depends on many parameters, including, but not limited to, coefficient of friction, mode shape, and frequency and amplitude of vibrational modes. In tests, preloads of the order of 6 to 15 lb (2. 72 to 6. 8 kilograms) per spring damper were demonstrated to provide adequate damping levels. Effectiveness of shot damping of vibrations having amplitudes from 20 to 200 times normal terrestrial gravitational acceleration (196 to 1, 960 meters per square second) and frequencies up to 12 kHz was demonstrated for shot sizes from 0. 032 to 0. 062 in.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 84 - 86. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experiments to identify stiffness and damping force coefficients of a two bladed teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal and a gas damper seal, both of diverging clearance, are presented. Calibrated impact guns excite a housing holding the test seal, and the seal displacement and acceleration time responses in two orthogonal directions are measured. A frequency domain parameter identification procedure allows the determination of the seals' dynamic force coefficients over a frequency range. Tests are made for a centered seal condition without journal rotation and with rotation at 1, 500 and 3, 000 rpm. The pressure drop across the seal is controlled by increments in the inlet supply pressure to values three times the exit (ambient) pressure. The two bladed labyrinth seal becomes less stable with increasing pressure ratio across the seal. This seal exhibits positive direct stiffness and negative direct damping. Cross-coupling is observed but identification of cross-coupled stiffnesses is poor. Comparison with analytical predictions is good for mass flow and direct damping coefficients. Predicted values for direct stiffness are negative, contrary to identified values. The same labyrinth'seal is transformed into a four pocket damper seal and tested under identical conditions. The damper seal is shown to be more stable dynamically but can create a static instability due to excessive negative direct stiffness. In the test facility used, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>housing</b> does not have enough direct stiffness to support the damper seal at pressure ratios greater than 2. 0. Cross-coupled stiffness is not detected in the measurements. The direct damping coefficients are positive and large in magnitude compared to those from the labyrinth seal measurements.

40|$|Rim driven {{thrusters}} with structurally integrated brushless PM motors are now {{an established}} technology with an increasing range of applications. In these thrusters, the stator {{of the motor}} is housed within the thruster duct, and the rotor forms a ring around {{the tips of the}} propeller. Such high pole number motors tend to be very thin radialy, have very small length to diameter ratios, and have relatively large airgaps to accommodate corrosion protection layers on the surfaces of the rotor and stator. The relatively large diameter stator laminations of such machines tend therefore to have very thin back of core and narrow teeth, which make them expensive and difficult to manufacture. This paper proposes an alternative potentially lower cost motor topology featuring a slotless stator whose laminations are manufactured from a single strip of steel that is edge wound into a spiral (like a “slinky ” and then fitted over the windings that are preformed on the outside surface of a non-conducting former. The former is also part of <b>the</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>housing</b> that protects <b>the</b> stator from corrosion in seawater.
