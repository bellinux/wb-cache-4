Rat Mups also bind limonene-1,2-epoxide, resulting in a disease of the host's kidney, hyaline-droplet nephropathy, that progresses to cancer.

As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue.

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> majority of the drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide {{the structure of a}} choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural {{symbols of the}} nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.|$|E

5|$|Shiren the Wanderer was {{developed}} by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom, with the core concept of repeated play, with the player improving their equipment and items each time they play, making progress through several playthroughs. The developers noted that Shiren the Wanderer differed from other Mystery Dungeon titles in that the Chunsoft staff create characters themselves, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> Mystery Dungeon series more fully than with the other titles, which are set in already created worlds which Chunsoft cannot change.

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>the</b> majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E
