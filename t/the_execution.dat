5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. <b>The</b> <b>execution</b> was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E

5|$|In 1737, Murray {{acted as}} Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the {{aftermath}} of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before <b>the</b> <b>execution.</b> Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution.
