5|$|In 2006, Anuncio Digital Media, {{a locally}} started digital {{advertising}} firm, installed its first mall-based digital signage network, {{which consists of}} a series of twenty plasma screen televisions around the main concourse and in the food court that display six-second sound-free advertisements. Post Oak Mall was the first of four CBL-owned malls to receive <b>this</b> <b>network,</b> with four other CBL malls scheduled to follow. The advertising displays were activated on September 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Guinness World Records {{recognized}} Folding@home as {{the most}} powerful distributed computing network. As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS). At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 7.924 petaFLOPS. In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors. Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a linear speedup for every added processor. <b>This</b> <b>network</b> allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Cassini {{found the}} first {{evidence}} of fluid-filled channels on Titan, {{in a series of}} deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. <b>This</b> <b>network</b> of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited <b>this</b> <b>network</b> between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. <b>This</b> <b>network</b> needs {{to be capable of}} absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E
5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, <b>this</b> <b>network</b> extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The next step was the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. <b>This</b> <b>network</b> revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E

5|$|The hilly {{area around}} Aarhus {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of <b>this</b> <b>network</b> are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago).|$|E

25|$|Tilburg has an {{extensive}} bicycle path network called Sternet-Routes. The first bicycle path of <b>this</b> <b>network</b> was built {{between the city}} center and the university in 1975. From the mid-1990s, multiple bicycle paths (rather than lanes along the road) have been built. Since most of these have been paved by tiles, there is an increasing call for asphalt-paved paths. For <b>this</b> <b>network</b> of bicycle paths, some new tunnels were built under the railway that crosses the city.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{shows how}} {{learning}} within networked learning {{can be understood}} {{through the lens of}} situated learning theory through the concept of legitimate pe-ripheral participation (Lave and Wenger, 1991) and the situated curriculum (Gherardi et al., 1998). The focus of the study is a ten month leadership pro-gramme for owner-managers of small businesses. The chapter reports key find-ings from an ethnographic study including a virtual ethnography of one cohort of 25 delegates. Specifically, it asks ‘how do small business owners learn to become leaders through networked learning?’ It is argued that delegates learn how to be-come members in <b>this</b> <b>networked</b> learning community. Leadership learning is part of this process and is associated with a shift in identity as the learner gains fuller participation. This chapter argues that the facilitators within <b>this</b> <b>networked</b> learn-ing experience are enablers of the social construction of the delegates’ identity. Given the importance of the enablers’ roles, the chapter finishes by arguing that critical reflexivity is essential within networked learning...|$|R
