40|$|Abstract: The {{machining}} efficiency of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V {{is low and}} the tool wear is serious. In this paper, uncoated carbide tool and two kinds of {{coated cemented carbide tool}} were used for dry turning titanium alloy. The experiments used CCD Observing System and the EDAX analysis of SEM to study tool wear mechanism and analyze the cutting performance <b>through</b> <b>tool</b> life, cutting force and cutting temperature. The results show that the main wear reasons are adhesion, diffusion and oxidation wear. For coated tool, the coating peeled off first, and then tool substrate damaged. Compared with coated carbide tool, the uncoated carbide tool with fine grain has longer tool life and lower cutting force and cutting temperature. The changes of cutting force and cutting temperature with cutting speed are not obvious when using the ccomposite coating (TiAlN and AlCrN) carbide tool. The results can help to choose tool material reasonably and control tool wear...|$|E

40|$|Cosmetic defects such as 'hollows' are {{the result}} of {{deviations}} in a skin panel. These deviations are usually too small and local to be detected by discrete measurements of the panel but become visually apparent after the application of paint. As a result, the perceived quality of a panel may become unacceptable and considerable time may be dedicated to minimizing their occurrence <b>through</b> <b>tool</b> modifications. This paper proposes that there are three aspects to the problem: the springback or buckling of the panel, the optics of the painted panel and the ability of an observer to perceive the defect. In particular, it will be argued that hollows cause optical distortions that inform the human eye of the presence of a defect. The paper then suggests that signal processing techniques, in particular the wavelet transform, provide a simple way of locating and quantifying the severity of these defects. The transform was applied to two physical parts and a simulation model...|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of defects such as 'hollows' and 'shock lines' {{can affect the}} perceived quality and attractiveness of automotive skin panels. These defects {{are the result of}} the stamping process and appear as small, localized deviations from the intended styling of the panels. Despite their size, they become visually apparent after the application of paint and the perceived quality of a panel may become unacceptable. Considerable time is then dedicated to minimizing their occurrence <b>through</b> <b>tool</b> modifications. This paper will investigate the use of the wavelet transform as a tool to analyze physically measured panels. The transform has two key aspects. The first is its ability to distinguish small scale local defects from large scale styling curvature. The second is its ability to characterize the shape of a defect in terms of its wavelength and a 'correlation value'. The two features of the transform enable it {{to be used as a}} tool for locating and predicting the severity of defects. The paper will describe the transform and illustrate its application on test cases...|$|E

Prediction of {{tool wear}} {{is essential to}} maintaining the quality and integrity of machined parts and minimizing material waste, for sustainable manufacturing. Past research has investigated deterministic models such as the Taylor tool life model and its variations for tool wear prediction. Due to the inherent stochastic nature of tool wear and varying operating conditions, the accuracy of such deterministic methods has shown to be limited. This paper presents a stochastic approach to tool wear prediction, based on the particle filter. The technique integrates physics-based tool wear model with measured data to establish a framework, by iteratively updating the tool wear model with force and vibration data measured during the machining process, following the Bayesian updating scheme. Effectiveness of the developed method is demonstrated <b>through</b> <b>tool</b> wear experiments using a ball nose tungsten carbide cutter in a CNC milling machine...|$|E
