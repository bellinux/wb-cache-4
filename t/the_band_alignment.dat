While <b>the</b> energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> of conventional semiconductors is quite well understood, systematic experimental studies on oxides are still missing. This work presents an extensive study on <b>the</b> intrinsic energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> {{of a wide range}} of functional oxides using photoelectron spectroscopy with in-situ sample preparation. The studied materials have particular technological importance in diverse fields as solar cells, piezotronics, multiferroics, photoelectrochemistry and oxide electronics. Particular efforts have been made to verify the validity of transitivity, in order to confirm the intrinsic nature of <b>the</b> obtained <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> and to understand the underlying principles. Valence band offsets up to 1. 6 eV are observed. The large variation of valence band maximum energy can be explained by the different orbital contributions to the density of states in <b>the</b> valence <b>band.</b> <b>The</b> framework provided by this work enables the general understanding and prediction of energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> at oxide interfaces, and furthermore the tailoring of energy level matching for charge transfer in functional oxides.

50|$|Band bending {{models in}} {{solid-state}} electronics: The {{behavior of a}} solid-state device {{is strongly dependent on}} the size of various Schottky barriers and band offsets in the junctions of differing materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Some commonly used heuristic approaches to predict <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> between materials, such as Anderson's rule and the Schottky-Mott rule, are based on the thought experiment of two materials coming together in vacuum, such that the surfaces charge up and adjust their work functions to become equal just before contact. In reality these work function heuristics are inaccurate due to their neglect of numerous microscopic effects. However. they provide a convenient estimate until the true value can be determined by experiment.|$|E

Our calculated results present that <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> of the tensiley strained Ga 1 -xInxNyAs 1 -y quantum wells on InP substrates is better than than that of the compressively strained Ga 1 -xInxNyAs 1 -y quantum wells on GaAs substrates and both substrates provide deeper conduction wells. Therefore, tensiley strained Ga 1 -xInxNyAs 1 -y quantum wells with In concentrations of x<= 0. 53 on InP substrates can be used safely from <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> point of view when TM polarisation is required.
