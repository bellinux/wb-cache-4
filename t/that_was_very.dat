5|$|Lennon {{started a}} skiffle group <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> briefly called the Blackjacks, but {{changed the name}} before any public performances. Some {{accounts}} credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 {{when he was first}} introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.|$|E

5|$|Exile One, {{based in}} Guadeloupe, {{is a leading}} Dominican kadans group of the 1970s <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{influential}} {{in the development of}} caribbean music. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Dominica, Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records. The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gracie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The system was first noted as an area of thunderstorms east of the Lesser Antilles which moved {{just north of the}} Greater Antilles, quickly intensifying into a hurricane on September 22. Gracie was a storm <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult to forecast, with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Shero {{failed in}} an attempt to become the Detroit Red Wings head coach. A year later he was {{diagnosed}} with stomach cancer. He underwent surgery but remained healthy enough to start his new position as color analyst for the New Jersey Devils radio broadcasts. In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989. The reunion was to help him with his medical costs, but it was also something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> important to Shero on a personal level, as it was a return to the organization he had the most success with. On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E
5|$|In April, Longstreet besieged Union {{forces in}} the city of Suffolk, Virginia, a minor operation, but one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} to Lee's army, still stationed in war-devastated central Virginia. It enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of provisions that had been under Union control. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May. Despite Lee's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, Longstreet once again came under criticism, claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee. However, from the Chancellorsville and Suffolk scenario, Longstreet brought forward the beginnings of a new Confederate strategy. These events proved that the Army of Northern Virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time, and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters. Longstreet advocated the first strategic movements to utilize rail, interior lines, and create temporary numerical advantages in Mississippi or Tennessee prior to Gettysburg.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on the spot, on a position <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi was laying mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third step on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E
5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E

5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E
