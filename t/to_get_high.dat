5|$|Unlike {{most other}} episodes, the scenes which {{featured}} multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked-off cameras {{rather than the}} time-consuming Technodolly camera set-up. The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black, where a scene between Felix, Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take. It took almost three days to film the 15-second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira's tooth, involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve the desired effect when drilled into. The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a vaporiser <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu; instead of inhaling actual helium, the pitch of their voices was altered in post-production. A stunt double {{was used for the}} second-to-last scene, wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E

25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} are required <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of}} the charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{heat pump}} is {{a device that}} {{provides}} heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a [...] "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system.

2500|$|In 1902 Philipp Lenard {{discovered}} that the energy of these ejected electrons did {{not depend on the}} intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its frequency. So if one shines a little low-frequency light upon a metal, a few low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a very intense beam of low-frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are ejected; however they possess the same low energy, there are merely more of them. [...] The more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>high</b> energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light. Like blackbody radiation, this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and matter. However, it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light, as long as matter is quantum mechanical in nature.|$|E

Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world." ...|$|E

From [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she is seen to be currently in love with and waiting for Jeremy, who fell into a 20-year coma after falling off a stool at a slot machine; he is the man who first brought her to Las Vegas from Austin, Texas. Following the death of her ex-husband Casey in a freak fishing accident (he is later revealed to have been poisoned), Sam is left control of the casino. She becomes the latest former owner of the Montecito after failing to pay the back taxes owed on the property. Her ownership of the Montecito lasts for a week, when A.J. Cooper buys the Montecito by paying off the back taxes. A.J. fires Sam when she is rude to his ranch manager's son. After Delinda intervenes, Sam and Cooper work things out over a milkshake, bowling, beers, and cigars, and Cooper agrees to rehire Sam. Sam is originally from Texas and enjoys playing bingo. [...] In the season-five finale, Casey Manning's younger brother Vic Manning visits the Montecito to take over the ownership of the casino. At the end of the show, Sam and Vic are said to plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic – she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her – she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to reveal}} the kinds of inequalities that {{constrain}} Ann Veronica <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>higher</b> education and <b>to</b> analyze her struggles to reach her desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>higher</b> education {{in dealing with the}} gender inequalities that she faces. The researcher used feminist literary criticism to answer the objectives of the research. This study is a qualitative research employing content analysis method. The data source of this research is a novel entitled Ann veronica by H. G Wells which was published in 1909 by Harper & Brothers. The data were some expressions to convey the kinds of problems that constrain Ann Veronica <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>higher</b> education and her struggle in the novel. The instruments of the research are the researcher herself and the data sheet. Data analysis was conducted through six steps: identifying the data, reading and re-reading the data, coding and categorizing the data, sorting the data, interrelating the description, and interpreting the meaning of description. The trustworthiness of the data was gained by providing rich, thick description; reading and re-reading the data; and conducting triangulation. In the analysis, the researcher found two results related to the objectives of the study. The first result is related to the inequalities that constrain Ann veronica <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>higher</b> education. They are (1) stereotypes towards women: being domestic, being pure, and being irrational; (2) marginalization towards women: being discouraged and being discriminated; (3) subordinations towards women: women cannot become a decision maker in the family and women have less privileges than men; and 4) violence towards women. The second result is Ann Veronica’s struggle to reach her desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>higher</b> education. They are (1) having courage: leaving her family for freedom and living without protection; and (2) proving her ability to reach her goal: trying hard to be financially independent and studying for knowledges.
