2500|$|Physics {{programs}} typically {{deal with}} meta-theories and its laws regarding applied science, hence most undergraduate physicists take up additional careers where {{their knowledge of}} physics can be combined with further training in other disciplines, such as computer science, information <b>technology,</b> <b>patent</b> laws, engineering diplomas, animation, teaching, etc. for industry or self-employment. [...] A typical undergraduate physics program covers essential basic competence required in areas of physics endeavor like astrophysics, laboratory knowledge, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, calculus, etc. and also in computer science and programming. [...] Hence a majority of Physics bachelor's degree holders are employed in the private sector. Other fields are academia, government and military service, nonprofit entities, labs and teaching.|$|E
