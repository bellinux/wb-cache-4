5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich that he was going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Touch {{sequences}} {{fall into}} two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates.

Do not disclose to other personnel. When the evacuation is ordered, the code will be read out on Armed Forces Radio. The code is: The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising. This {{will be followed by}} the playing of I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas." [...] Frank Snepp later recalled the arrival of helicopters at the Embassy while the song was playing over the radio as a [...] "bizarre Kafkaesque time".

2500|$|Sympathy for the Devil is {{also the}} title of a producer's edit of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard whose own {{original}} version is called One Plus One. [...] The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in Rolling Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.'

2500|$|After {{the success}} of her first solo release, the live DVD Dreamshow, which reached the No. 1 {{position}} in the UK chart in August 2005, Siouxsie received demos from several composers. Universal soon offered her a new record deal on the label W14, which {{was about to be}} created by John Williams, whom had already previously worked with her for Peepshow and Boomerang. Commenting on the news on her website in July 2006, Siouxsie stated, [...] "At least I didn't have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> spray-painting my name {{on the front of the}} Universal building"!

2500|$|They were dragged to {{the nearby}} Casement Park sports ground. Here they were again beaten and {{stripped}} to their underpants and socks by {{a small group of}} men. According to the BBC and The Independent the men were also tortured. A search revealed that the men were British Army soldiers. Redemptorist priest Father Alec Reid, who later played a significant part in the peace process leading to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, intervened and attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to call for an ambulance, but was dragged away and threatened with shooting if he didn't stand up; he was then pulled away from the men. [...] The corporals were further beaten and thrown over a high wall to be put into a waiting black taxi.

2500|$|On November 11, {{during an}} intense bombardment, Smith was badly bruised when a {{cannonball}} {{crashed into the}} barracks, struck him in the left hip, and showered him with bricks. Before being removed from the fort, Smith tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to volunteer to take command but no one stepped forward. Finally, Smith appointed Thayer to lead the defense, noting he was, [...] "the bravest man he had ever known." [...] Thayer accepted. He would command the fort from the 12th to the 15th. When he took charge, the situation was rapidly becoming critical. On November 15, the British managed to work Vigilant, an East Indiaman razeed into a 20-gun floating battery, into a position 200 paces from the fort. HMS Somerset (64), HMS Isis (50), HMS Roebuck (44), and HMS Pearl (32) blasted Mud Island from the river while numerous batteries flayed the fort from the land side. Thayer gamely directed his men to move a 32-pound cannon to the threatened area. The gun crew put 14 shots into the Vigilant but soon had to abandon the piece as the position was deluged by fire. With the situation hopeless, Thayer ordered the fort to be evacuated that evening and the survivors were rowed across to Red Bank, New Jersey. There were about 300 survivors. Thayer stayed behind with about 40 men to burn down {{what remained of the}} barracks and left at midnight. On the morning of November 16, the British took possession of the wrecked fort.|$|E

Companies {{are becoming more and more}} dependent on email because it allows them to communicate with clients and other companies quickly and efficiently. There are some issues, such as privacy, which we need to be aware of with such a medium of communication. It seems that the more technology advances the less privacy we have. People are sending their private information over a unsecured network, which could be deadly in the wrong hand. We need to educate people on how easy it is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>someone’s</b> e-mail and also provide alternate ways to protect a user’s privacy.
