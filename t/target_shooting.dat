5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone <b>target</b> <b>shooting</b> together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone <b>target</b> <b>shooting</b> together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

25|$|Reproductions of {{the paper}} {{cartridge}} Sharps M1859 and M1863 Rifle and Carbine, the metallic cartridge 1874 Sharps Rifle, and Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 are being manufactured today. They are used in Civil War re-enacting, hunting and <b>target</b> <b>shooting.</b>|$|E
25|$|These rifles {{have been}} banned from {{importation}} (1989 for all Polytech rifles) and (1994 for Norinco rifles) to the U.S., due to a Clinton era prohibition on Chinese made firearms. They are commonly sold and are popular in Canada for hunting and <b>target</b> <b>shooting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lee–Enfields {{are very}} popular as hunting rifles and <b>target</b> <b>shooting</b> rifles. Many surplus Lee–Enfield rifles {{were sold in}} Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States after the Second World War, and a fair number have been 'sporterised', having had the front {{furniture}} reduced or removed and a scope fitted so that they resemble a bolt-action sporting rifle. Top-notch accuracy is difficult to achieve with the Lee–Enfield design, as {{it was intended to}} be a battle rifle rather than a sharpshooter's weapon, and thus the Enfield is nowadays overshadowed by derivatives of Paul Mauser's design as a <b>target</b> <b>shooting</b> arm. They did, however, continue to be used at Bisley up into the 1970s with some success, and continue to perform extremely well at Military Service Rifle Competitions throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|When his {{organization}} needed female entertainers for the chorus line of their next show, he encouraged his 12-year-old stepdaughter to audition. While Ball was onstage, she realized performing {{was a great}} way to gain praise and recognition. Her appetite for recognition had thus been awakened at an early age. In 1927, her family suffered misfortune. Their house and furnishings were lost to settle a financial legal judgment after a neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone <b>target</b> <b>shooting</b> in their yard under the supervision of Ball's grandfather. The family subsequently moved into a small apartment in Jamestown.|$|E

Since RTÉ own rights to several competitions any fixtures clashing with RTÉ 2's schedule will often be provided on RTÉ One, however RTÉ One rarely provides sporting events on weekdays hence most soccer matches are shown on RTÉ 2. These include UEFA Champions league and the League of Ireland and competitive Ireland National Football Team matches. George Hamilton is the station's main sports commentator.

5000|$|Two other {{styles are}} also being pursued {{to make up the}} Olympic blowgun event, both based upon the Cherokee Annual Gathering Blowgun Competition. The Field Style {{competition}} is similar to the winter Biathlon, where the shooter runs from a starting line to a <b>target</b> lane, <b>shoots</b> and retrieves the darts, and continues to the next station. The course length varies from [...] m or longer, with from 9 to 16 targets at various heights and shooting distances. The final style is the Long Distance <b>target</b> <b>shoot.</b> The <b>target</b> is a circle of [...] diameter, and the firing line is [...] away. Three darts are fired by each shooter, at least one of which must stick in the target. All successful shooters move to the next round, moving back 2 m each time.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before they finally got an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo got the last touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had a chance to put Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the <b>target,</b> <b>shooting</b> high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier Giroud's shot was saved by McGregor.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} attacks {{and the lack}} of {{military}} help from the Pennsylvania government disheartened the settlers along the West Branch of the Susquehanna. In the early summer of 1778 news came of a group of Native American warriors, perhaps accompanied by Loyalist and British soldiers, heading for the West Branch Susquehanna River valley to destroy all the settlements there. This news was provided by a friendly Native American named Job Chiiloway at Fort Reed (modern Lock Haven), who was then murdered as he slept, by a drunk settler engaged in <b>target</b> <b>shooting.</b> The Wyoming Valley battle and massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). A mass attack there first overwhelmed small settler forts, followed by a massacre of many of the women and children who had taken refuge there. This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley.|$|E
25|$|The M1911A1 {{is popular}} {{among the general}} public in the U.S. for {{practical}} and recreational purposes. The pistol is commonly used for concealed carry {{thanks in part to}} a single-stack magazine (which makes for a thinner pistol that is, therefore, easier to conceal), personal defense, <b>target</b> <b>shooting,</b> and competition. Numerous aftermarket accessories allow users to customize the pistol to their liking. There are a growing number of manufacturers of M1911-type pistols and the model continues to be quite popular for its reliability, simplicity, and patriotic appeal. Various tactical, target and compact models are available. Price ranges from a low end of around $400 for basic pistols imported from the Philippines or Turkey (Armscor, Tisas, Rock Island Armory, Girsan, STI Spartan, Seraphim Armoury) to more than $4,000 for the best competition or tactical versions (Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, and STI International).|$|E
