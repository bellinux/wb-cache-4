5|$|In 2001, a <b>temporary</b> <b>visitor</b> {{security}} screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it.
