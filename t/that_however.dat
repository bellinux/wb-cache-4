5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes <b>that</b> <b>however</b> one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted <b>that</b> <b>however</b> unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and that he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as <b>that.</b> <b>However,</b> I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|Promotion {{began in}} 1998, when Spears did a small tour in malls and food courts that were located mostly in larger {{cities around the}} United States and Canada. Each show lasted around thirty minutes, and Spears had two male dancers {{with her on the}} stage. The promo tour is also known as the L'Oreal Mall Tour, after its sponsor. The singer made several promotional {{appearances}} including talk shows and live performances around the world. On December 1998, Spears' first showed up on MTV's and the Box's most-requested video charts. She also appeared on the Ricki Lake Show, the Howie Mandel Show, and was the presenter of the 1999 American Music Awards, prior to the release of the album. The singer also appeared on MTV's Spring Break and on the hundredth episode of Nickelodeon's All <b>That.</b> <b>However,</b> after hurting her knee, she had rescheduled appearances several shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. After recovering, Spears embarked on another promotional schedule. The singer appeared on 12th Annual Nickelodeons Kids' Choice Awards on May 1, MTV's FANatic on May 12, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee on May 3, and The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 25.|$|E

5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. <b>That</b> <b>however</b> proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E
5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was in. In {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. Even <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first down at their 35-yard line. The first play of the quarter resulted in a 20-yard gain by Evans on a running play. After <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> the Hokies did not gain another first down and punted to Cincinnati. Following the kick, the Bearcats started their first possession of the fourth quarter at their 14-yard line. Running back Isaiah Pead ran for three yards, but then a pass by Pike was intercepted at the 10-yard line by Tech defender Orion Martin. Three rushing plays later, Evans ran six yards for a touchdown. The extra point kick was good, and with 11:29 remaining in the game, Virginia Tech took a 20–7 lead.|$|E

5|$|The presidential {{elections}} of May 1989 were marred by fraud and violence. COLINA, a pro-military coalition {{led by the}} PRD, named Carlos Duque, a former business partner of Noriega as its candidate. ADOC, an opposition coalition, nominated Guillermo Endara, a member of Arias' Panameñista Party, and two other prominent oppositionists, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, as vice-presidential candidates. Anticipating fraud, the opposition tracked ballot counts at local precincts {{on the day of}} the election (local ballot counts were done in public). As an exit poll made it clear that the opposition slate was winning by a wide margin, reports of missing tally sheets and seizures of ballot boxes by PDF soon emerged. In the afternoon of the day after the election, the Catholic Bishops conference announced that a quick count of public tallies at polling centers showed the opposition slate winning 3-to-1. Official tallies the day after <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> had Duque winning by a 2–1 margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{presumption}} that carnivorous dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds was first {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. <b>That,</b> <b>however,</b> was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in {{a more or less}} natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|E
