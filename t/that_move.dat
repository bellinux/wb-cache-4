5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species <b>that</b> <b>move</b> at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects <b>that</b> <b>move</b> in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Escape from Woomera is a point-and-click {{adventure}} game. The player, controlling Mustafa, {{explores the}} Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals <b>that</b> <b>move</b> about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him {{information about the}} facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.|$|E

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} <b>that</b> <b>move</b> in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
5|$|Plinian eruptions {{are similar}} to both Vulcanian and Strombolian eruptions, except that rather than {{creating}} discrete explosive events, Plinian eruptions form sustained eruptive columns.

5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways <b>that</b> <b>move</b> from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E

5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures <b>that</b> <b>move</b> horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C.

The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported <b>that</b> <b>move,</b> aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity <b>that</b> <b>move</b> {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator.

5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms <b>that</b> <b>move</b> the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists <b>that</b> <b>move</b> into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species <b>that</b> <b>move</b> short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E
