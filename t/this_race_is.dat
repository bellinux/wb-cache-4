The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most points is {{the winner of the}} stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely.

500|$|Host–parasite {{coevolution}} is the coevolution of a {{host and}} a parasite. A general characterization of many viruses, obligate parasites, is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts. Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot {{keep up with the}} other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. <b>This</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> known as the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the Red Queen's race in Through the Looking-Glass: [...] "it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place". The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.|$|E

500|$|Following {{interference}} {{from both the}} White and Black Guardians, the Doctor materialises the TARDIS in {{what appears to be}} the hold of an Edwardian vessel, though the Doctor senses something is amiss. The human crew have no idea how they got there nor where they are, but know they are helping their captain to run a race. The Doctor and his companions, Tegan and Turlough discover that the ship, and several other historical Earth ships, are competing in a solar sail race through the Solar System. The ship's officers reveal themselves to be Eternals, compared to the Doctor and the humans as Ephemerals. The Eternals live in the [...] "trackless wastes of eternity" [...] and rely on Ephemerals for their thoughts and ideas. <b>This</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> being run by the Guardians to win Enlightment, the wisdom to know everything. The Doctor finds that the Eternals have made his TARDIS vanish, forcing him and his companions to stay until the race's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|Other {{planets in}} Sender One include Sunder, Hephaestus, Democratus, and Limbus. The galaxy's {{scientific}} community is headquartered on the temperate planet of Sunder, {{and people are}} only permitted to go there if they are sufficiently intelligent. Hephaestus is an important religious center. A mostly volcanic planet, Hephaestus hosts a town and temple complex of monks who study MysTech. Democratus is climatically similar to Earth, with regions of desert, snow, forest, and prairie. Several populations of different sentient species exist on the surface, but the planet is ruled by a race of tall, thin humanoids with large craniums who dwell on a large mechanical ring constructed around the planet. <b>This</b> <b>race</b> <b>is</b> obsessed with the ideal of democracy, and though they possess incredible scientific and engineering knowledge, they are constantly bogged down by their own ineptitude and the frailties of the democratic process. Limbus {{is known as the}} [...] "planet of death", as voyagers never return; its surface is arid and rocky, with sparse vegetation. A planet mentioned but not seen in the game is Krapton, home to superheroes and villains. Most of Krapton's human population has fled, tired of being constantly abducted and saved by warring superpeople.|$|E

[...] Per Mare kept in touch through to Barnes Bridge but Per Terram pushed on and passed the finishing post with a winning margin of two lengths.
