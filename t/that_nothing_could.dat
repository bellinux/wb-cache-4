5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E
5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> have done would have {{surprised}} me. Rather should I have said <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> would have surprised me save {{the thing he}} did.|$|R

5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> stop its growth.|$|E
5|$|Some say <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be {{more desperate}} than the measure, but I answer {{that the state}} of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E
25|$|In October 2015 he {{traveled}} to India to attend the India-Africa Summit and there were calls for his arrest by Amnesty International but since India is not a signatory of the Rome statute the ICC does not have jurisdiction in India. During an interview, while in India, he stated <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> prevent him from going to South Africa again in December.|$|E
25|$|With this {{commission}} Manon, the third trophy, {{slipped out of}} the room, as untouched as she had come; her errand didn't seem to trouble her. I was greatly relieved at the thought <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> touch her, that she would always remain as she was and never become like her mother, the poisoner on the wall, the glassy, blubbery old woman on the sofa.|$|E

50|$|By mid-December, quorums became {{difficult}} to obtain and leaders of both parties agreed <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> further <b>could</b> be brought up {{before the start of}} the 78th Congress in January 1943.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Dobson {{then left}} the band in November 2006. Although there was no formal {{announcement}} regarding his departure, a notice on the band's forum explained <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> more <b>could</b> be said, for [...] "legal reasons".|$|R
25|$|The {{historian}} John Willis-Bund states <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> show {{better the}} feelings of both parties, and {{it may or may}} not have been in accordance with the laws of war to have cut down a preacher making disloyal speeches, but to kill in cold blood a man who had in his pocket a journal with doubtful entries was a disgrace even to those wild times.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of Limited Time (allotted to Ahriman by Zurvan) implied <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> change this preordained {{course of the}} material universe, and {{the path of the}} astral bodies of the ‘heavenly sphere’ was representative of this preordained course. It followed that human destiny must then be decided by the constellations, stars and planets, who were divided between the good (the signs of the Zodiac) and the evil (the planets). “Ohrmazd allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets” (Menog-i Khirad 38.4-5).|$|E
25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] replied Smith, {{who knew}} well <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> offer would tempt {{his men to}} go on with the opening of a tomb after sunset. [...] "Let them go away. You and I will stop and watch the place till morning." ...|$|R

60|$|That she was deceiving {{herself in}} saying this Mary knew well enough; and Mrs. Fenwick, too, guessed {{that it was}} so. Nevertheless, it was plain enough <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> more <b>could</b> be said about Mr. Gilmore just at present.|$|R
25|$|At {{three o'clock}} Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with his}} wisest assistants and they {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. Students {{did not want to}} leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that the}} University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. It was a terrible blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were {{parked in front of the}} entrance to the church so <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church.|$|E
25|$|Snorri then relates that Aðils was in {{war with}} a Norwegian king named Áli, and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr (Hroðulf) and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three {{valuable}} gifts in recompense. Hrólfr {{was involved in a}} war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including Bödvar Bjarki. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli's helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat Finn's heritage. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} after this. Despite the {{lingering}} fumes of wine that obscured the brain, everyone felt that with these few words the praefect of Rome had already given an answer, and <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be said after {{this would have}} the power of making him alter his decision. But Marcus Ancyrus, conscious of his own powers of diplomacy, took up the thread of his host's peroration.|$|R
60|$|He did not, however, wait long. So heavy was the sea, now, <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> {{whatever}} <b>could</b> be done should any vessel drive ashore, and, as for {{the fisher}} boats, the sailors shook their heads as they spoke of them.|$|R
60|$|It was morning. She {{came down}} the same as usual, and asked if there had arrived any {{telegram}} or letter; but there was neither. Louis avoided her, knowing <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> he <b>could</b> say just then would do her any good.|$|R
25|$|Snorri also {{presents}} {{the story of}} Aðils and Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf) in order to explain why gold was known by the kenning Kraki's seed. Snorri relates that Aðils was in war with a Norwegian king named Áli (Onela), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hrólfr {{was involved in a}} war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including Böðvarr Bjarki. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli's helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat Finn's heritage. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.|$|E
25|$|Jellicoe {{continued}} {{to take a}} pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done to defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after {{he had failed to}} act on “secret, but absolutely reliable” information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the Battle of Caporetto and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.|$|E
500|$|Wilson met {{his future}} wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter, a Cadillac saleswoman and former model, while {{browsing}} through a car dealership in 1986. Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their [...] "rope's end" [...] with Wilson, and {{that they did not}} know what to do to help him. Three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter.|$|E
60|$|I remonstrated warmly, but <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> I <b>could</b> say moved her.|$|R
60|$|Pierson {{sat with}} {{trembling}} lips, feeling <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> he <b>could</b> say would touch her just then. The sick man's face was hardly visible {{now in the}} twilight, and Gratian went over to his bed. She stood looking down at him a long time.|$|R
60|$|The day was Sunday. I loitered {{about the}} garden, {{listening}} to the distant church-bell ringing for the afternoon service. Without any cause that I knew of to account for it, I was so restless <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> I <b>could</b> do attracted me or quieted me.|$|R
