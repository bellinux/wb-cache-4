Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student, tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki.

Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another AMAB student their age from another class who also secretly wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult transsexual woman named Yuki who is living with a man named Shiina.

Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto {{is not able to}} appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives.

5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school {{who wants to be a}} boy, but she realized that a boy who wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E

You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything.
