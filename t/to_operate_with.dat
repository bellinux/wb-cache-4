5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier I {{was the first}} planned {{aircraft carrier}} conversion project of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010.

To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour.

5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.|$|E
5|$|On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres {{began and}} the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority {{operations}} to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> relative freedom.

Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> his division.

Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was fast enough to steam with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes. The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See Jürgen Reimpell in 1918, {{an officer of the}} 1st Aviation Detachment.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Space Centre was {{established}} as a foundation on 5 July 1987, {{under the protection of}} the Ministry of Trade and Industry. It immediately took over Andøya Rocket Range and TSS followed suit in 1990. TSS was upgraded in 1991 to be able <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> ERS-1. In 1995 NRS established a subsidiary, Norwegian Space Centre Property, to own the facilities in Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The same year, TSS was converted to a limited company, of which half was sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). The aim was that TSS would operate as a fully commercial enterprise. Its first major contract was with the Canadian Radarsat.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued <b>to</b> <b>operate,</b> <b>with</b> a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E

The summer schedule was <b>to</b> be <b>operated</b> <b>with</b> Laker's brand-new DC-10 widebodied jet aircraft to take advantage of increased demand he anticipated for his new low-fare service during the peak months from June to September {{as well as of the}} DC-10's low break-even load factor of only 52%. The winter schedule was <b>to</b> be <b>operated</b> <b>with</b> 707 narrowbodies as specified in Laker's original application to the ATLB.|$|R
5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, the {{mobilization}} of the fleet was complete; Kaiser Karl VI {{was assigned to the}} Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where {{they would be able to}} operate alongside French and British warships.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Cold War, Australian defence {{planning}} assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and RAN.|$|E
5|$|Following the Italian {{declaration}} of war against the Central Powers on 23 May 1915, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets. Sankt Georg {{took part in the}} operation; escorted by a pair of torpedo boats, she shelled the city of Rimini. She damaged a railroad bridge and was not engaged by Italian forces. Thereafter, the Austro-Hungarians returned to their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought. For most of the war, Sankt Georg was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though she was too slow <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the narrow waters and numerous islands of the Adriatic allowed Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a great degree of freedom. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. As a result, Iride did not see action during the war. She was sold for scrap in December 1920 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
