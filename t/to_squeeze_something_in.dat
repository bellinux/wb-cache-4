The women kneel on the ground: two women use pestles and mortars, one woman <b>squeezes</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her hands over a bucket, and another woman holds vegetables on her knees. The women may be making fufu, a traditional dough-like food made with ground boiled vegetables such as yams, plantain or cassava. This photograph was pasted into {{one of a series of}} exercise book albums created by Emily Godfrey, Matron of the Ama Achara Methodist Hospital...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic trees {{can provide}} a stable basis for a higher-level {{classification}} of organisms that reflects evolutionary relationships. However, some lineages have a complex evolutionary history that involves explosive radiation or hybridisation. Such histories have become increasingly apparent {{with the use of}} DNA sequence data for phylogeny estimation and explain, in part, past difficulties in producing stable morphology-based classifications for some groups. We illustrate this situation by using the example of tribe Mirbelieae (Fabaceae), whose generic classification has been fraught for decades. In particular, we discuss a recent proposal to combine 19 of the 25 Mirbelieae genera into a single genus, Pultenaea sens. lat., and how we might find stable and consistent ways <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>something</b> as complex as life into little boxes for our own convenience. © CSIRO...|$|R
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>something</b> out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|R
50|$|Drastic cuts {{followed}} the eventual peace, but Britain, {{now the only}} colonial power of any importance, found her maritime commitments increased. Melville did not think the fleet could be reduced much below 100 ships of the line. The cabinet {{set a limit of}} forty-four. The following years saw a constant struggle by Melville to find every possible economy while he avoided meeting a target he regarded as unreal. He quietly got his way, not least by improving the design and durability of ships, research on which benefited from his close personal interest. Yet he resisted the introduction of steamers, since an infant technology seemed bound to prove expensive and unreliable; moreover, if navies were to be rebuilt all round as steam driven, Britain would place herself on the same level as her rivals. By the late 1820s he was able to authorise the construction of new and larger classes of ship, matching those in France and the United States. Even out of tight budgets he never failed <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>something</b> for another scientific interest, in exploration (where places are named after him, see below).|$|R
60|$|Herbert glanced reflectively at his companion. 'You mustn't let me tire you,' he said; 'but even on our theory {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} follow that you yourself would be much affected. It's true this fellow Sabathier really {{was something of a}} personality. He had a rather unusual itch for life, for trying on and on <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>something</b> out of experience that isn't there; and he seemed never to weary of a magnificent attempt to find in his fellow-creatures, especially in the women he met, what even--if they have it--they cannot give. The little book I wanted to show you is partly autobiographical and really does manage to set the fellow on his feet. Even there he does absolutely take one's imagination. I shall never forget the thrill of picking him up in the Charing Cross Road. You see, I had known the queer old tombstone for years. He's enormously vivid--quite beyond my feebleness to describe, with a kind of French verve and rapture. Unluckily we can't get nearer than two years to his death. I shouldn't mind guessing some last devastating dream swept over him, held him the breath of an instant too long beneath the wave, and he caved in. We know he killed himself; and perhaps lived to regret it ever after.|$|R

You see we used to go-— all of us-—to some seaside place, and be quite free there, keeping no {{particular}} hours, and being so intensely happy. I haven't yet got over the feeling {{that it is only}} for a time, and we shall go back into the dear old home and its regular ways." [...] Then clasping her hands over her side as though <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>something</b> back, she broke out, [...] "O Mary, Mary, you mustn't scold me! You mustn't bid me tie myself to regular hours till this summer is over. If you knew the intolerable stab when I recollect that he is gone-—gone-—gone for ever, you would understand that there's nothing for it but jumping up and doing the first thing that comes to hand. Walking it down is best. Oh! what will become of me when the mornings get dark, and I can't get up and rush into those woods? Yes"-—as Mary made some affectionate gesture-—"I know I have gone on in a wild way, but who would not be wild who had lost him? And then they goad me, and think me incapable of proper feeling," [...] and she laughed that horrid little laugh. [...] "So I am, I suppose; but feeling won't go as other people think proper. Let me alone, Mary, I won't damage the children. They are Joe's children, and I know what he wanted and wished for them better than Robert or anybody else. But I must go my own way, and do what I can bear, and as I can, or-—or I think my heart would break quite, and that would be worse for them than anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|The track title [...] "Chū Chū Lovely Muni Muni Mura Mura Purin Purin Boron Nururu Rerorero" [...] {{is based}} on an {{assortment}} of sound effects in Japanese, chū chū (meaning the sound of a kiss) lovely muni muni (the sound of someone <b>squeezing</b> <b>something</b> soft) mura mura (the sound of being horny) purin purin (the sound with which large breasts are emphasised in Anime) boron (the sound of something that pops out) nururu (the sound of moving around <b>in</b> <b>something</b> wet and dirty) rerorero (the sound made by the tongue going over something).|$|R
5000|$|The root kvas- in Kvas-ir likely {{stems from}} the Proto-Germanic base *kvass-, meaning <b>to</b> “to <b>squeeze,</b> squash, crush, bruise”. Regarding this etymology, {{linguist}} Albert Morey Sturtevant comments that “fluids may result from the crushing or pressing of an object (cf. Dan. kvase ‘to crush <b>something</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> out the juice’). Hence we are justified in assuming the stem syllable in kvas-ir has reference to the fluid (saliva) out {{of which he was}} created and that the name Kvas-ir denotes the person who possesses the characteristic qualities inherent in this fluid, viz., poetic inspiration and wisdom.” ...|$|R

And indeed the conceit was half spoiled by changing the numbers; that of four being much more cabalistic, and therefore better exposing the pretended virtue of numbers, a superstition then intended to be ridiculed." ...|$|R
