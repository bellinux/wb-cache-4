40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect, describe, and {{interpret}} source materials pertaining to the history of the <b>three</b> <b>area</b> vocational centers and the <b>three</b> <b>area</b> vocational schools in Utah. The historical method of research was used, and the collection of data was from personal interviews, research of records, and publications of the six vocational institutions, the Utah State Board of Education, and the local school districts. The <b>three</b> <b>area</b> centers and the <b>three</b> <b>area</b> schools began as an outgrowth of the 1963 Vocational Education Act and the 1968 Vocational Amendments. These vocational institutions were established to meet the needs of local students and to meet the economical needs of the local school districts.

5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these <b>three</b> <b>areas,</b> but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge {{is split}} into three {{geographical}} areas: north, south and west. The Oldman River separates West Lethbridge {{from the other}} two while Crowsnest Trail and the Canadian Pacific Railway rail line separate North and South Lethbridge. The newest of the <b>three</b> <b>areas,</b> West Lethbridge (pop. 36,716) {{is home to the}} University of Lethbridge, opened at that site in 1971, but the first housing was not completed until 1974 and the prime Whoop-Up Drive access opened only in 1975. Much of the city's recent growth has been on the west side, and it has the youngest median age of the three. The north side (pop. 26,751) was originally populated by workers from local coal mines. It has the oldest population of the <b>three</b> <b>areas,</b> is home to multiple industrial parks and includes the former Hamlet of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge in 1978. South Lethbridge (pop. 31,337) is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the downtown core, the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments, and the Lethbridge College.|$|E

The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|Weirfield Riverside is {{a linear}} nature reserve {{along the bank}} of the River Tone {{providing}} alder and willow woodland, bramble, scrub and rough grassland. The wetter areas which are sometimes flooded include hemlock water dropwort, and yellow flag. Silk Mills Park and Ride includes landscaping and ponds in <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> next to the River Tone created when the park and ride was created. The woodland and grassland supports aquatic and marginal vegetation. There are a variety of birds, bats, reptiles and invertebrates. Frieze Hill Community Orchard has been converted from allotments to rough grassland and an orchard. The kingston black and yarlington mill varieties of apples are among those grown.|$|E
5|$|A large monsoon trough was {{anchored}} {{south of}} Guam {{towards the end}} of July. By July21, <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one of which would later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900UTC on July21 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Later on July22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned. On July23, both the JMA and JTWC upped the depression into a tropical storm. Bess then began to intensify. At 0600UTC on July24, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. After the formation of an eye, both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.|$|E

There is also a small hamlet at Barrow Hill {{to the north of}} West Mersea. The land immediately facing the Blackwater is known as the Mersea flats, which is mostly beach that dries at low tide. The former Bradwell Power Station can be seen on the other side. West Mersea can be further divided into <b>three</b> <b>areas.</b> The Old City in the southwest of West Mersea serves the fishing and yachting industries and contains a number of listed buildings. The centre contains the church of St Peter & St Paul, while the beach and esplanade are to the south.|$|E

5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the <b>three</b> <b>areas.</b> The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the <b>three</b> <b>areas,</b> with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E
5|$|Yavuz escorted {{the members}} of the Ottoman Armistice Commission to Odessa on 30 March 1918, after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. After {{returning}} to Constantinople she sailed in May to Sevastopol where she had her hull cleaned and some leaks repaired. Yavuz and several destroyers sailed for Novorossiysk on 28 June to intern the remaining Soviet warships, but they had already been scuttled when the Turkish ships arrived. The destroyers remained, but Yavuz returned to Sevastopol. On 14 July the ship was laid up {{for the rest of the}} war. While in Sevastopol, dockyard workers scraped fouling from the ship's bottom. Yavuz subsequently returned to Constantinople, where from 7 August to 19 October a concrete cofferdam was installed to repair one of the <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> damaged by mines.|$|E
5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles again split as <b>three</b> <b>areas</b> in 2010.
