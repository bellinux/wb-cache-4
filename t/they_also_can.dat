25|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} Chinese community in Jakarta for many centuries. Jakarta is home to the largest population of Chinese on Java island. The Chinese in Jakarta traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown) areas. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be found in the old chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. Officially, they make up 5.53% of the Jakarta population, although this number may be under-reported.|$|E

25|$|Another {{distinction}} between NetTutor {{and other services}} is that a set of written guidelines is drawn up in consultation with client institutions and amended as needed. Such guidelines reinforce tutoring best practices, such as that tutors should prefer the Socratic method and scaffolding over simply answering questions. However, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used to instruct tutors to adopt special practices preferred by the client. Some examples of tutoring guidelines {{are available on the}} Web.|$|E
25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E

25|$|With no {{new designs}} of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. {{stockpile}} {{must continue to}} function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead. Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.|$|E
25|$|Prior to a song, each {{band member}} selects {{from one of}} four {{difficulty}} levels, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert, which influence the number and rate that notes appear on the note track; <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> select the Pro mode for real guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums. As the band performs, they score points. Each player can build up a multiplier by hitting consecutive notes correctly, which increases how many points each note is worth, but the multiplier is set back to 1× if a note is missed. After successfully completing a song, the performance of each player and the band {{as a whole is}} rated on a 5-star scale. The best performance by a player for each song in the player's library is tracked separately based on instrument, Basic or Pro mode, and difficulty, then is used to provide and compare leaderboard statistics {{at the end of the}} song.|$|E
25|$|US {{military}} {{resources can}} be used as part of a counter-drug (CD) component of a FID program. While these are most often focused on supply, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used to interfere with drug shipment. Since the United States Department of Defense is the lead government agency of the USG for the detection and monitoring (DM) of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the US, the DM mission is performed with regularly appropriated funds, notwithstanding the possibility of incidental benefit to the HN. Such activities may include nonconfrontational intercepts for intelligence or communication purposes and gathering and processing of tactical intelligence from a variety of sources, including fixed and mobile surveillance assets and certain intelligence sharing. In a CD support role (subject to national policy and legislative guidance) DOD may offer certain direct support to HN CD personnel, and certain enhanced support to US civilian law enforcement agencies that may be operating in the HN, and to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement of the United States Department of State.|$|E

500|$|The program {{usually has}} 40–50 first-year students, 15 {{advanced}} students, and 15 counselors. Students are admitted by application—which includes {{a set of}} mathematical questions—or by showing [...] "a great eagerness to learn". First-year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars. They are encouraged to think like scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed, which occupies most of their free time. Ross designed the daily problem sets, and many questions contain his signature directions: [...] "Prove or disprove and salvage if possible." [...] Successful {{students are asked to}} return as students and counselors in future summers. Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first-years with their questions. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars. Student problem sets are graded daily by the live-in counselors.|$|E

2500|$|A saddle {{is often}} worn when a horse is longeing. In these circumstances, it is {{important}} that the stirrups do not bang against the horse's side. On an English saddle, the stirrups are [...] "run up." [...] To do this, run up the stirrups as they are kept when the saddle is off the horse, then bring the loop of stirrup leather around the stirrup iron before bringing it under the back branch and attaching looping the end of the leather (with the holes in it) through the stirrup leather keeper. [...] Stirrups on a western saddle cannot be run up, so they are usually tied together under the belly of the horse with a piece of twine or rope, though for a very skittish young horse <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be thrown up over the top of the saddle and tied down in that fashion.|$|E

[...] "pinochling" [...] does not require a bidder to make their bid. [...] <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> play for this victory even if their bid cannot be made with the maximum number of trick points available plus their meld. [...] However, the highest bidding player or team can prevent other players from attempting this if they elect to [...] "throw in" [...] the hand before the first card is played.|$|E
2500|$|Squib is {{the term}} applied to {{a child who is}} born of magical parents, but who {{develops}} no magical abilities. They are considered to be the opposite of Muggle-born wizards/witches. Squib births are rare: the only Squibs noted as such in the books are Argus Filch, Arabella Figg, and Molly Weasley's second cousin who was an accountant. The Ministry does not require them to be registered as part of the Community. Squibs share some things with wizards and they are aware of and comprehend the Wizarding World. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> see Hogwarts and possibly Dementors, which ordinary Muggles cannot. However, according to Ron's Aunt Muriel, the custom with Squibs has been to send them to Muggle schools and encourage them to integrate into the Muggle world, which is [...] "much kinder" [...] than keeping them in the wizarding world where they will always be [...] "second-class". In contrast to most of the wizarding world's acceptance and even respect for Muggles and Muggle-born wizards and witches, it is often considered embarrassing to have a Squib in the family.|$|E
