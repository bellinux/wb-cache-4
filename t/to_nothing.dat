5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come <b>to</b> <b>nothing,</b> and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E

60|$|Again, {{there would}} be places where they stayed the week {{together}} in splendid rooms, had banquets every day, rode out among heaps of wonders, walked through miles of palaces, and rested in dark corners of great churches; where there were winking lamps of gold and silver among pillars and arches, kneeling figures dotted about at confessionals and on the pavements; where there was the mist and scent of incense; where there were pictures, fantastic images, gaudy altars, great heights and distances, all softly lighted through stained glass, and the massive curtains that hung in the doorways. From these cities they would go on again, by the roads of vines and olives, through squalid villages, where {{there was not a}} hovel without a gap in its filthy walls, not a window with a whole inch of glass or paper; where there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> support life, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> eat, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> make, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> grow, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hope, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do but die.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time. He tried to {{interest}} {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b> He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E

The proposal was met with doubt in South Australia, and it later came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b> On 20 October 2017 it ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia.|$|E

5|$|In July 2007, Hong Kong {{businessman}} Carson Yeung, via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK)-listed company Grandtop International Holdings Limited (GIH), bought 29.9% of the plc {{from its}} directors. Although {{his intention to}} take full control of the club initially came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b> GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of £81.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings (BIH).|$|E
5|$|Next <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> is {{recorded}} of the Germanic languages spoken in the Empire, {{with the exception}} of Gothic. A phrase of Gothic is quoted in an elegiac couplet from the Latin Anthology, and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus. While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June Army Norway {{launched}} {{its effort to}} capture Murmansk in a pincer attack. The northern pincer, conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by crossing the border at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing {{the neck of the}} Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led <b>to</b> <b>nothing,</b> and this front became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|The {{club and}} a next-door {{restaurant}} and bar were destroyed in an electrical fire in June 1973, resulting in $1.5 {{million worth of}} damage.

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|When {{producer}} Kevin McClory {{had first}} planned {{the film in}} 1964 he held initial talks with Richard Burton for the part of Bond, although the project came <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> because of the legal issues involved.

5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much {{later on in}} the 15th century, by that time the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed {{what remained of the}} Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this and the project came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b> The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of the}} site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|As {{speculation}} of {{a move to}} Hibernian came <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> (despite {{his being}} installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell {{at the end of}} June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales. To do this he fended off competition from Aidy Boothroyd, Lawrie Sanchez, and Steve Staunton. At the start of his reign he had a limited squad, and had to draft in youth players for the Llanelli game. The club had sold off some of their best players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought in Peter Ward as assistant manager.|$|E
5|$|At {{the demand}} of the sultan, Transylvania troops {{assisted}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay {{double the amount}} of the yearly tribute. Balthasar Báthory murdered Sigismund's secretary, Pál Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during the absence of the king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came <b>to</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E

60|$|Deprived of {{all those}} sources of {{happiness}} which seem inherent in woman, {{the wife of the}} Sovereign sometimes seeks in politics and in pleasure a means of excitement which may purchase oblivion. But the political queen is a rare character; she must possess an intellect of unusual power, and her lot must be considered as an exception in the fortunes of female royalty. Even the political queen generally closes an agitated career with a broken heart. And for the unhappy votary of pleasure, who owns her cold duty to a royal husband, we must not forget that even in the most dissipated courts the conduct of the queen is expected to be decorous, and that the instances are not rare where the wife of the monarch has died on the scaffold, or in a dungeon, or in exile, because she dared to be indiscreet where all were debauched. But for the great majority of royal wives, they exist without a passion; they have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hope, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> fear, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> envy, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> want, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> confide, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hate, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> love. Even their duties, though multitudinous, are mechanical, and, while they require much attention, occasion no anxiety. Amusement is their moment of great emotion, and for them amusement is rare; for amusement is the result of equal companionship. Thus situated, they are doomed to become frivolous in their pursuits and formal in their manners, and the Court chaplain or the Court confessor is the only person who can prove they have a soul, by convincing them that it will be saved.|$|R
