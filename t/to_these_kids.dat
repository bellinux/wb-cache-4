40|$|Objective. Over {{the past}} decade, {{multiple}} factors {{have changed the}} pattern of neonatal surgical emergencies. An increase in prenatal screenings {{and the development of}} neonatal tertiary care centres have changed the clinical approach <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> Materials and methods. Between 1995 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with diagnosis of uncommon rare neonatal surgical emergencies at our institute. We analyzed: sex, gestational age, weight at birth, primary pathology, prenatal diagnosis, associated anomalies, age and weight at surgery, clinical presentation, start of oral feeding and hospitalization. The follow-up was performed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Results. There were 21 male and 13 female. The gestational age ranged between 28 and 36 weeks. The weight at birth ranged between 700 and 1400 grams. Oral feeding was started between 4 th and 10 th postoperative day. The average hospitalization was about 70. 47 days. To date, all patients have finished the followup. They are healthy. Conclusion. The outcome of the patients with uncommon surgical emergencies is different based on the etiology. Overall survival is generally good but is influenced by the associated anomalies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} timing tool for {{language}} training of hearing impaired children. Two major problems for these children to learn oral language are confusion of different phonemes and the timing within different words and syllables. In this paper we focus on developing techniques to overcome the timing problem. The techniques include timing error detection, visual feedback, and head tracking. The aim of the timing tool is to provide support to improve the speaking ability {{of the kids who}} are profoundly deaf and aided by hearing aids, cochlear implants, or a combination of both. We first describe the language training process in which the timing problem is addressed. We propose to use a modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to detect timing errors. The timing information is fed back to the user through a visual interface. Because the auditory stimulus is degraded, the visual feedback is extremely important <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> Two schemes can be used to produce the visual feedback. One scheme is to use the recorded video sequence of the kid to produce a corrected video replay; the other is to use a synthetic head to emphasize visual parts (lip-movement) that is wrong. 1...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{analyses}} associate rhetorical {{questions with}} negative singleton answers, but I introduce new data (including Switchboard corpus data) with rhetorical {{questions that have}} {{a wider range of}} answers: (1) Negative answer Who lifted a finger to help? (2) Positive answer Has the educational system been so watered down that anybody who' s above average is now gifted? (3) Non-null answer Who always shows up late to class? (4) Multiple answers What’s going to happen <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> when they grow up? I propose a new condition for felicitous use of rhetorical questions: the Speaker and Addressee must share prior commitments to similar and obvious answers. I frame the analysis of shared answers within Gunlogson's (2001) model of Common Ground, and I define sufficiently similar answers as those that either have an identical value or share an extreme position on a contextually relevant scale. Obviousness is measured using van Rooy's (2003) implementation of entropy for calculating the predictability of an answer set. Because they invoke an answer set, rhetorical questions resemble interrogatives, but the obviousness of a particular answer implies the bias of an assertion. As such, they are assertive, yet uninformative: instead of informing any discourse participant, rhetorical questions are redundant and serve to synchronize Speaker and Addressee beliefs...|$|E
40|$|Songs {{have become}} a good {{technique}} for English teachers to use in their classes because songs bring variety to the classroom and they also avoid that students get bored. In other words, students feel more motivated and interested in learning English language through songs in a more real context of communication. Students can also improve their pronunciation and vocabulary learning. In view of this, our project was based on teaching vocabulary to six year olds through songs. This project began with an analysis of theories, approaches, characteristics of learners and important characteristics of songs too. All this information was an important base for our project because it supported our idea that using songs {{was a good way}} to teach vocabulary to little kids. Then we started working with a group of eleven children who were attending second grade. According <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> interests, needs, and abilities; we chose four songs corresponding to topics like: Farm Animals, Days of the Week, Numbers, and Colors. After the application of these songs in the English class we got important results which supported our idea that songs are a good technique to teach new words to six year olds. It is our wish to share our experience with other English teachers and we know that our project will be an important and useful contribution to encourage teachers towards awareness that songs are a good tool to use in the English class because children will become more interested in learning this language in a more fun and pleasant way.
