60|$|From {{time to time}} I heard {{encouraging}} {{news from}} Lee about horses.

He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> big grizzly cow-killer being chased and shot in Chevelon Canyon. News about hounds, however, was slow in coming. Dogs were difficult to find. At length Haught wrote me that he had secured two; and in this same letter he said the boys were cutting trails down under the rim.|$|E
40|$|For {{my master}} thesis in physics, I spent my days in an {{experimental}} lab working with electronics, liquid nitrogen, vacuum pumps, and tiny semiconductor lasers. It seemed every day another {{component of the}} set-up would fail–I felt utterly misplaced. But then <b>a</b> friend <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> a fascinating new field in physics that linked statistical physics to brain science. It was an exciting period: the papers by Hopfield (Hopfield, 1982) and their mathematical analysis (Amit et al., 1985) were all new, and the Kohonen self-organizing map (Kohonen, 1984) was analyzed by physicists next door (Ritter and Schulten, 1988). In 1988, I decided to change field and apply my theoretical modeling skills to neuroscience. I learned the tricks of mathematical analysis of Hopfield networks during an internship with Leo van Hemmen {{at the university of}} Munich early in 1989, which filled the time before I started a one-year stay as a visiting scholar at Berkeley in the lab of Bill Bialek. The hot topic in Munich (Herz et al., 1989) as well as in some othe...|$|R

6000|$|And, again, he ruminated: [...] "One thing that'll come handy in {{the country}} is that I know horses; that's a big start. I can always get a job at that--if it ain't at union wages.

60|$|Then he obliged me, and {{to cheer}} me up he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> little {{tramping}} experience {{he had in}} Baja California. Somewhere on the east slope of the Sierra Madre his burros strayed or were killed by mountain-lions, and he found it imperative to strike at once for the nearest ranch below the border, a distance of {{one hundred and fifty}} miles. He could carry only so much of his outfit, and as some of it was valuable to him he discarded all his food except a few biscuits, and a canteen of water. Resting only a few hours, without sleep at all, he walked the hundred and fifty miles in three days and nights. I believed that Nielsen, by telling me such incidents of his own wild experience, inspired me to more endurance than I knew I possessed.|$|E
60|$|To-day I {{have been}} out {{among some of the}} camps of the 2nd {{division}} of the 1st Corps. I have been wandering around all day, and have had a very good time, over woods, hills, and gullies--indeed, a real soldier's march. The weather is good and the travelling quite tolerable. I have been in the camps of some Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York regiments. I have friends in them, and went out to see them, and see soldiering generally, as I can never cease to crave more and more knowledge of actual soldiers' life, and to be among them as much as possible. This evening I have also been in a large wagoners' camp. They had good fires and were very cheerful. I went to see a friend there, too, but did not find him in. It is curious how many I find that I know and that know me. Mother, I have no difficulty at all in making myself at home among the soldiers, teamsters, or any--I most always find they like to have me very much; it seems to do them good. No doubt they soon feel that my heart and sympathies are truly with them, and it is both a novelty and pleases them and touches their feelings, and so doubtless does them good--and I am sure it does that to me. There is more fun around here than you would think for. I told you about the theatre the 14th Brooklyn has got up--they have songs and burlesques, etc.; some of the performers real good. As I write this I have heard in one direction or another two or three good bands playing--and hear one tooting away some gay tunes now, though it is quite late at night. Mother, I don't know whether I mentioned in my last letter that I took dinner with Col. Fowler one day early part of the week. His wife is stopping here. I was down at the 14th as I came along this evening, too--one of the officers <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> presentation to George of a sword, etc.--he said he see it in the papers. The 14th invited me to come and be their guest while I staid here, but I {{have not been able to}} accept. Col. Fowler uses me tip-top--he is provost marshal of this region; makes a good officer. Mother, I could get no pen and ink to-night. Well, dear mother, I send you my love, and to George and Jeff and Mat and little girls and all.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dorian Gray, [...] "there {{is nothing}} fearful about it. It {{is one of}} the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or {{faithful}} wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean--middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from the proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp, there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realised how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said." ...|$|E
60|$|AMY. I don't {{know what}} you mean. All I know is that she means to give Mr. Dolphin a good talking to. He's so mercenary.

60|$|In the {{profession}} he had adopted, his success was now quite decided. Within {{the last three}} months he had taken this house (a small château, they <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>about</b> half <b>a</b> league without the Porte de Crécy); this country site being chosen {{for the sake of his}} mother's health, with which town air did not now agree. Hither he had invited Mrs. Bretton, and she, on leaving England, had brought with her such residue furniture of the former St. Ann's Street mansion as she had thought fit to keep unsold. Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs, and the wraiths of looking-glasses, tea-urns, and teacups.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was needless {{for us to}} say anything, {{to explain}} the state of our {{feelings}} toward each other. That tale was told by the delight with which we met.

I was three stories up, walking along scaffolding with a bucket of clip-ties in my arms when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat I was wearing saved my life.Years later, when I sat down to write Tropic of Fear, a political thriller set in South America, I thought of those experiences. They became part of the background of a secondary character, “Dink” Denton, a former roughneck, ex-Apache helicopter pilot in both Panama and the First Gulf War, now undercover in Paraguay as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|R

60|$|Soon {{we were on}} a high-road, and {{surprise}} seized on my mind as I beheld a village of some magnitude close at hand; for I had been told that the neighbourhood of the lake was uninhabited except by trout. The road smoked in the twilight with children driving home cattle from the fields; and a pair of mounted stride-legged women, hat and cap and all, dashed past me at a hammering trot from the canton where they had been to church and market. I asked one of the children where I was. At Bouchet St. Nicholas, he <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Thither, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> mile south of my destination, {{and on the other side}} of a respectable summit, had these confused roads and treacherous peasantry conducted me.
