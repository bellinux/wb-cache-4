40|$|A {{retrospective}} survey of <b>transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{associated with a}} brand of commercial Factor VIII {{was carried out in}} 24 Haemophilia Centres from January 1974 until December 1975. Of 371 patients who were transfused with this product, and were followed up, 78 cases of hepatitis affecting 66 patients were found (17. 7 %). Two types of hepatitis were observed: hepatitis B and non-B hepatitis, the latter with an incubation period of between 8 and 60 days. Twelve patients contracted two types of hepatitis, non-B followed by hepatitis B. Only one patient died after contracting hepatitis B. Four of the suspect batches of concentrate were found to be positive for HBsAg by radioimmunoassay. There was evidence that the presence of hepatitis B surface antibody in a patient's serum prior to exposure was associated with immunity to hepatitis B.

40|$|Objective: Since transfusion-transmitted {{infections are}} one of the most {{encountered}} complications in <b>transfusion</b> practice, <b>hepatitis</b> B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are routinely screened in blood banks. These screening tests are obligatory for transfusion safety and also give a rough idea about the seropositivity rates of a region. For this purpose, a record based retrospective study was conducted among the blood donors of Türkiye Yüksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital. Method: The records of 3825 donors between the ages of 18 - 65 who had fulfilled a blood donation form and were accepted as a donor in Türkiye Yüksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital from June 2008 to June 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. HBs Ag, anti HCV and anti HIV tests were performed on the blood of donors by the macro ELISA method (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, Germany). Results: Of the 3825 blood donors, 39 (1 %) were positive for hepatitis B and 23 (0. 6 %) were positive for hepatitis C. Eighty five (2. 2 %) of the blood samples which were found HIV seropositive by ELISA technique were determined as negative by Western blot and assumed to be false seropositivites. Conclusion: The low rate of seropositivity for hepatitis B and hepatitis C among blood donors may be due to the regular use of blood donation forms in donation process and the high awareness of people living in capital city Ankara about transfusion-transmitted infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{recognized}} that hepatitis C virus subtypes (1 a, 1 b, 2 a, 2 b, 2 c and 3 a) originated in Africa and Asia and spread worldwide exponentially during the Second World War (1940) through the transfusion of contaminated blood products, invasive medical and dental procedures, and intravenous drug use. The entry of hepatitis C virus subtypes into different regions occurred at distinct times, presenting exponential {{growth rates of}} larger or smaller spread. Our study estimated the growth and spread of the most prevalent subtypes currently circulating in São Paulo. Methods: A total of 465 non-structural region 5 B sequences of hepatitis C virus covering a 14 -year time-span were used to reconstruct the population history and estimate the population dynamics and Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor of genotypes using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach implemented in BEAST (Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling tree software/program). Results: Evolutionary analysis demonstrated that the different hepatitis C virus subtypes had distinct growth patterns. The introduction of hepatitis C virus- 1 a and - 3 a were estimated to be circa 1979 and 1967, respectively, whereas hepatitis C virus- 1 b {{appears to have a}} more ancient entry, circa 1923. Hepatitis C virus- 1 b phylogenies suggest that different lineages circulate in São Paulo, and four well-supported groups (i. e., G 1, G 2, G 3 and G 4) were identified. Hepatitis C virus- 1 a presented the highest growth rate (r =  0. 4), but its spread became less marked after the 2000 s. Hepatitis C virus- 3 a grew exponentially until the 1990 s and had an intermediate growth rate (r =  0. 32). An evident exponential growth (r =  0. 26) was found for hepatitis C virus- 1 b between 1980 and the mid- 1990 s. Conclusions: After an initial period of exponential growth, the expansion of the three main subtypes began to decrease.

OBJETIVO: Comparar o perfil epidemiológico dos casos confirmados de hepatites B e C notificados no Núcleo de Vigilância Epidemiológica do Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, no período entre janeiro de 2004 e abril de 2007. MATERIAL: Os resultados foram analisados através do teste do qui ao quadrado. RESULTADOS: Observou-se 112 casos confirmados de hepatite B e 651 de hepatite C. Houve predominância do sexo masculino dentre os casos de hepatite B e do sexo feminino entre os de hepatite C, com significância estatística. A faixa etária mais frequente foi de 30 a 39 anos, considerando-se hepatite B (P CONTEXT: Viral {{hepatitis}} is {{a disease}} of compulsory notification and is very important due to its high prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological profiles of hepatitis B and C, reported through surveillance at the "Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual", São Paulo, SP, Brazil, from January 2004 to April 2007. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study revealed 112 confirmed cases of hepatitis B and 651 of hepatitis C. Male gender predominated among hepatitis B while female gender predominated among hepatitis C, statistically significant. Hepatitis B occurred mainly among patients from 30 to 39 years old (P< 0. 01), and hepatitis C was more frequent among patients from 40 to 49 years old (P = 0. 49). Asthenia was the most frequent symptom. The main risk factors were: sexually transmitted diseases (hepatitis B; P< 0. 01), previous surgery and blood <b>transfusion</b> (<b>hepatitis</b> C; P< 0, 01). Cases were mostly confirmed through laboratory tests. Chronic hepatitis occurred in 54. 5 % and 81. 7 % cases of hepatitis B and C, respectively (P< 0, 01). Virus B was mostly transmitted by sexual contact (P< 0, 01); virus C was transmitted mainly by blood transfusion (P< 0, 01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings were similar to national and international data available. Epidemiologic surveillance {{plays an important role}} in determining the viral hepatitis profile in order to provide adequate screening and prevention...|$|E
40|$|Background Repeated {{blood transfusions}} in thalassemic {{patients}} cause iron accumulation in tissues and might impair organ func- tion. Other peril of blood <b>transfusion</b> is <b>hepatitis</b> C virus infection. Objectives This study aimed {{to find out}} the proportion of increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased transferrin saturation (TS), and positive anti hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) among thalas- semic patients and to get the profile of ALT among thalassemic patients who have increased TS and positive anti-HCV. Methods This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on β- and β-HbE-thalassemic patients at the Thalassemia Outpa- tient Clinic, Department of Child Health, Medical School, Univer- sity of Indonesia–Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in May 2002. Results Subjects were 57 homozygous β-thalassemic and 33 β- HbE-thalassemic patients. No one had regular desferoxamine or history of splenectomy. Proportions of increased ALT, TS, and posi- tive anti-HCV were 76 %, 78 %, and 6 %, respectively. Duration of illness, total volume of packed red cell (PRC) transfusions, TS level, and positive anti-HCV seemed to have role in the increased pro- portion of subjects with increased ALT, whereas duration of illness and total volume of PRC seemed to have role in the increased TS. Conclusion Factors that seem to have a role in the increased proportion of subjects who had increased ALT and TS were (1) duration of illness, total volume of PRC transfusion, TS, and posi- tive anti-HCV; 2) duration of illness and total volume of PRC trans- fusion, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Transfusion</b> {{transmitted}} <b>hepatitis</b> {{has been}} a severe problem in Turkey in pediatric cancer patients and in chronic congenital anemia. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus infections in these patients in a University Hospital. METHODS: Multi-transfused 66 children (59 acute leukemia, 6 thalassemia major, 1 severe hereditary spherocytosis) diagnosed and followed-up between May, 2000 and December, 2006 were evaluated. Screening of all the patients for HbsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HIV was performed at presentation and during the last follow-up. Serologic studies of leukemic patients were also repeated at the end of the chemotherapy. Hepatitis B vaccination was administered to unvaccinated patients with anemia. All blood products were provided by Blood Bank of the Center. RESULTS: No patient was found HBsAg, anti-HCV or anti-HIV positive at diagnosis and at the end of the therapy. There was history of hepatitis B vaccination in only 42 % of the patients at diagnosis due to administration of this vaccine to newborns since 1998. At the beginning of the study, 45 % (n= 27) of the leukemic patients were immune for hepatitis B, but after completion of the intensive chemotherapy seropositivity persisted in only 28. 8 % (n= 17). CONCLUSION: Transmission of these viruses is no longer a real problem even in multitransfused immunosuppressed children in Pediatric Hematology Units as a result of the improvements in screening of voluntary blood donors, administration of disposable material in clinics and vaccination by hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} {{the prevalence of}} positive viral hepatitis titres in sickle cell disease (SCD) {{and the relationship of}} abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) to transfusions and ferritin levels. Charts from 141 patients with SCD were reviewed and recent laboratory data on serum ferritin, hepatitis serology, units of packed red blood cells transfused and LFTs were collected. Hepatitis B core antibodies were positive in 14 % of patients (12 / 86) and Hepatitis C viral antibody titres were positive in 16. 5 % (15 / 91). There was a relationship of positive serologies to <b>transfusion</b> for <b>hepatitis</b> C virus (HCV), but not for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis C antibody negative (HCVAb)) patients had fewer packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfused than Hepatitis C antibody positive (HCVAb+) (6. 4 vs. 20. 3, P 0. 08). Patients with ferritins 1000 ng/ml also showed a difference in units transfused (P < 0. 003). Steady state LFTs, with the exception of alkaline phosphatase, had no relationship to serum ferritin or hepatitis serologies. Males were twice as likely to have positive serology as females but more females had elevated ferritin levels. Paired analysis of LFTs in steady state and crisis failed to demonstrate deterioration during crisis. We conclude that: (1) there is a relationship of positive Hepatitis C serology, but not Hepatitis B serology, to transfusion; (2) ferritin levels correlate with transfusion number but not with LFTs; (3) in our population, LFTs in SCD are usually normal and do not increase in vaso-occlusive crises...|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) can {{be transmitted}} in the dialysis setting through blood transfusions and environmental surfaces. <b>Transfusion</b> related <b>hepatitis</b> C virus (HCV) infection is very well known, but only recently the environmental transmission of this virus was postulated, in order to study the prevalence, mechanisms of transmission, and the ALT patterns of HBV and HCV infections in hemodialysis and CAPD patients before the implementation of HBV vaccination and HCV screening in the blood bank, we conducted a study from January 1987 to January 1990, Sera from 185 hemodialysis and 124 CAPD patients were stored in this period and later analyzed for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-HCV (second generation ELISA). the prevalence of any HBV marker was 55. 7 % (103 / 185) for hemodialysis patients and 31. 5 % (39 / 124) for CAPD patients (hemodialysis vs. CAPD, p < 0. 001). the prevalence of positive anti-HCV was 35. 1 % (65 / 185) for hemodialysis and 33. 9 % (42 / 124) for CAPD patients (not significant). There was a significant association between HBV markers positivity and anti-HCV positivity. the multivariate analysis of risk factors revealed an association of the positivity of each virus with the duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT), number of previous blood transfusions, and past history of hemodialysis treatment. Thus, besides the transfusion-related transmission, hemodialysis environmental transmission may also occur for both viruses. {{the findings of a}} high prevalence of both viruses and evidence for environmental transmission in the dialysis setting are of major importance for the planning of future preventive measures.
