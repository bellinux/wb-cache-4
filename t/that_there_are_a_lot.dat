In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But I do believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E

[...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E
