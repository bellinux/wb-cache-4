5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve <b>to</b> <b>emulsify</b> it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

25|$|If ice {{is added}} after pouring {{it into the}} cup, this results in the {{formation}} of an aesthetically unpleasant layer {{on the surface of the}} drink, because the ice causes the oils to solidify.

25|$|A {{lipoprotein}} is a biochemical assembly {{whose purpose}} is to transport hydrophobic lipid (a.k.a. fat) molecules in water, as in blood or extracellular fluid. They have a single-layer phospholipid and cholesterol outer shell, with the hydrophilic portions oriented outward toward the surrounding water and lipophilic portions of each molecule oriented inwards toward the lipids molecules within the particles. Apolipoproteins are embedded in the membrane, both stabilising the complex and giving it functional identity determining its fate. Thus the complex serves <b>to</b> <b>emulsify</b> the fats. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesions, and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the plasma lipoprotein particles classified as HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL and ULDL (a.k.a. chylomicrons) lipoproteins, according to density / size (an inverse relationship), compared with the surrounding plasma water. These complex protein capsules enable fats to be carried in all extracellular water, including the blood stream (an example of emulsification), subgroups of which are primary drivers / modulators of atherosclerosis, the transmembrane proteins of mitochondrion, chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.|$|E

To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) secondary <b>to</b> <b>emulsified</b> silicone oil (SO). Methodology/Principal Findings. Prospective, interventional, consecutive case series of 11 eyes with sustained elevation of IOP after SO removal. The mean IOP at baseline, week 1, month 1, month 3, and month 6 was evaluated. The mean baseline IOP was significantly decreased from 25 ± 2. 7 [*]mmHg to 18. 4 ± 5. 5 [*]mmHg at week 1 (P= 0. 01), 17. 9 ± 3. 1 [*]mmHg at month 1 (P= 0. 008), 15. 8 ± 3. 9 [*]mmHg at month 3 (P= 0. 003), and 16. 2 ± 4. 7 [*]mmHg at month 6 (P= 0. 004).

40|$|AbstractHuman milk bile salt-stimulated lipase ensures {{efficient}} triacylglycerol utilization in breast-fed newborns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of {{emulsifier}} type on the micro-structural changes that occur <b>to</b> <b>emulsified</b> lipids as they pass through a model gastrointestinal system. Lipid droplets initially coated by different kinds of emulsifiers (lecithin, Tween 20, whey protein isolate and sodium caseinate) were prepared using a high speed blender. The emulsified lipids were then passed through an in vitro digestion model that simulated the composition (pH, minerals, surface active components, and enzymes) of mouth, stomach and small intestine juices. The change in structure and properties of the lipid droplets were monitored by laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, conventional optical microscopy, light scattering, and micro-electrophoresis. In general, there was a decrease in mean droplet diameter (d 32) as the droplets moved from mouth to stomach to small intestine. The electrical charge on the droplets stabilized by lecithin, Tween 20 and sodium caseinate were negative throughout the model GI system, while those stabilized by whey protein were positive in the stomach. This suggests that at least some of this globular protein remained attached to the droplet surfaces. The data was interpreted in terms of the competitive adsorption of phospholipids/bile salts with the adsorbed emulsifiers, as well as the enzymatic digestion of proteins and lipids. These results enhance our understanding of the physicochemical and structural changes that may occur <b>to</b> <b>emulsified</b> lipids within the gastrointestinal tract, which may have important consequences for the design of functional foods that alter lipid bioavailability. Nevertheless, there were appreciable differences between the behavior of emulsions within the in vitro model used in this study and literature reports of their behavior within in vivo studies, which highlights the need for more realistic in vitro digestion models...|$|R

40|$|Oxidation of cod liver oil rich in {{long-chain}} n- 3 polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LC n- 3 PUPA) was investigated during a gastrointestinal (GI) in vitro digestion. The digestion stimulated TBA-reactive substances (TBARS) formation {{in both the}} gastric and intestinal steps, whereas levels of lipid hydroperoxides remained nearly constant. The presence of digestive compounds was decisive for the TBARS development because TBARS did not change when the cod liver oil was subjected only to the temperature and pH gradient of the GI model. Preformed oxidation products in the cod liver oil resulted in further elevated TBARS levels during the digestion.

25|$|Some {{birds have}} {{a supply of}} powder down {{feathers}} which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from {{the ends of the}} barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure <b>to</b> <b>emulsifying</b> agents due <b>to</b> human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.|$|R
