5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is {{captured}} and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined {{where they have}} been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future.

5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Chris Sabin's jaw {{was broken}} {{in the final}} round match. Sabin needed serious medical {{assistance}} afterwards backstage due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> bleeding from the mouth. Sabin had to cancel an August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) appearance as a result. Shelley was also injured while taking part in the tournament. He suffered a legitimate back injury, but ended up appearing at the PWG show that Sabin was forced to miss. There, he aggravated the injury further, forcing him to miss two Ring of Honor shows for which he was scheduled.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{blackbuck}} numbers declined sharply due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> hunting, deforestation {{and habitat}} degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially {{where they are}} sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Intense rainbands {{produced}} gusty {{winds and}} heavy precipitation totaling to 5.90 in (150mm) in Martinique, causing street flooding and inundating homes. Roughly 5,000 residences lost {{power at the}} height of the storm, though the outages were brief and confined to the southeast of the island. A large landslide occurred in the capital of Fort-de-France due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> soil saturation, prompting some 40 families to evacuate the area. Across the city, deep flood waters affected 29 houses; a man was electrocuted and killed by an exposed wire in his flooded home.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner.

They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter fleet endured several {{attempts}} to procure successor aircraft to the type; {{in the case}} of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due <b>to</b> <b>excessive</b> cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of the Hunter itself. A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.|$|E
