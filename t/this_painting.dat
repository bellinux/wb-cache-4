5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments used for <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> were lead white, azurite (for the skirt of the kneeling menina), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> in August 1864 and {{finished}} it in November 1866. It {{was one of many}} paintings portraying key historical moments in the history of Poland that he would create over his life. Matejko however did not simply illustrate the history, he intended his paintings to have powerful educational and emotional values.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced <b>this</b> <b>painting.</b> Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E
5|$|Queen Zenobia Addressing her Soldiers by Giambattista Tiepolo; it {{dates to}} the early eighteenth century but the exact year is not known. <b>This</b> <b>painting</b> (part {{of a series of}} tableaux of Zenobia) was painted by Tiepolo {{on the walls of the}} Zenobio family palace in Venice, {{although}} they were unrelated to the queen.|$|E
5|$|The World Before the Flood is {{strongly}} influenced by A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan (1632–33) by Nicolas Poussin, whom Etty greatly admired and of whose works he had previously made several copies; <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not visible in the painting. Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.|$|E

5|$|The textural hues and {{schemes that}} Delaroche uses in <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> are quite {{detailed}} and well considered, especially {{in regards to}} the most important figures; such aspects of the work were described as being '...rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted the plait of a drapery, the shaggy texture of the four-footed animal, nor a detail of the harness on his back'.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} {{most of the}} funds needed to construct the hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters {{had never seen the}} temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, very different from the red and white of the Great East Hall. <b>This</b> <b>painting</b> indicates that Foguang Temple was an important stop for Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E
5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} East Room of the White House. <b>This</b> <b>painting</b> was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E

5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the painting was not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). <b>This</b> <b>painting</b> {{was one of the last}} works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> in the music room.|$|E
5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E

Caillebotte obtained one such example, [...] by Claude Monet in March of that year, {{and it is likely}} to have influenced this work.|$|R
