Palmer started a project in 1880 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> had been a local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E

They can choose {{to stay with the}} Force Recon Company and continue their assignment with the MEU, recycling its loop cycle; or they can get release from the FORECON company and go back to their original assignment, whether it being administration, motor transport, or infantry. However, on average, approximately 50% of the platoon will leave, their time in Force having expired.|$|E

25|$|Untaught by Maximilian II Emmanuel's experience, his son, Charles Albert (1726–1745), devoted all his {{energies}} to increasing the European prestige {{and power of}} his house. The death of the emperor Charles VI proved his opportunity: he disputed {{the validity of the}} Pragmatic Sanction which secured the Habsburg succession to Maria Theresa, allied himself with France, conquered Upper Austria, was crowned king of Bohemia at Prague and, in 1742, emperor at Frankfurt. The price he had to pay, however, was the occupation of Bavaria itself by Austrian troops; and, though the invasion of Bohemia in 1744 by Frederick II of Prussia enabled him to return to Munich, at his death on 20 January 1745 it was left to his successor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> terms he could for the recovery of his dominions.|$|E
25|$|Knox’s {{appointment}} at Ellis Island allowed him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> was his most {{significant contribution to}} medical science. Early in their time at Ellis Island, both Knox and his colleague, Glueck recognized two issues with using the Binet and Simon scales to measure intelligence in emigrants. First, the scale tested semantic knowledge that was specific to geographic location or culture. Individuals from other cultures might not fare well on these tests, and thus the measures could inaccurately classify them as mentally defective, when tests specific to their own location or culture would not. Further, the normative data used for comparing any individual score to an “average” individual {{of the same age}} was based on French or American schoolchildren, which would not be appropriate for determining mental fitness for entering the United States.|$|E
25|$|It {{was against}} Nottinghamshire again that Hawkins played his next {{significant}} innings: in the 1932 match, batting at No 9, {{he made an}} unbeaten 63 and shared a last-wicket partnership of 67 with Bill Andrews. And yet again, Nottinghamshire were the opposition when Hawkins began the 1934 season with an innings of 82: Hawkins scored {{more than half of}} Somerset's runs and came in after six wickets had gone for just 31 runs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> was then his highest score. This innings propelled Hawkins temporarily up the Somerset batting to a middle-order position, and it was from there, less than three weeks later, that he made his highest first-class score, 96 against Middlesex at Lord's, sharing a seventh wicket stand of 125 with Jack White that enabled Somerset to save a game where they had trailed by 207 on the first innings.|$|E

25|$|The {{large volume}} of UPS {{customers}} in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days. In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS. UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E

After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, The Number of the Beast, released in 1982. In the wake of Samson's contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited {{on any of the}} record's songs, having <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> <b>what</b> he called, a [...] "moral contribution", later revealing that he had contributed limited creative input to [...] "The Prisoner", [...] "Children of the Damned" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills".

[...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times, gave the film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "There are times when the director doesn't even seem {{to know where to}} put the camera. Scenes unravel without dramatic point. No amount of breathless editing and fancy graphics can disguise the amateur nature of the enterprise." [...] In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roger E. Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters were supposed to be Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E

500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|E
500|$|Several episodes {{focus on}} Kyle and his religion, {{and being the}} lone Jew has {{resulted}} in an enmity with the Antisemitic Cartman that has become significantly more pronounced as the series progresses. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle makes cracks at Cartman's weight and is horrified and disgusted with Cartman's immorality, cruelty, bigotry, and greed. Their rivalry often elevates {{to the point where}} Kyle becomes so obsessed with beating Cartman at whatever he does, he sometimes neglects Stan and Kenny in the process. He has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, often losing these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Though he has claimed Kenny was not his friend, in order to avoid having to spend the night at his poverty-stricken household, Kyle has professed a friendship with Kenny and shown genuine concern for Kenny's health and safety. Kyle normally has the angrier reaction of yelling, [...] "You bastards!" [...] following Stan's exclamation of the popular catchphrase, [...] "Oh my God, they killed Kenny" [...] after one of Kenny's trademark deaths.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} invoked {{responses from}} some {{cast and crew}} members from the series. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the BBC was glad that the episode provoked debate, and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story. That said Neame was also surprised {{by some of the}} responses, rationalising that those responders did not understand the context, and that it was not intended to offend anybody. Stephen Garrett, the director of Kudos Film and Television, the producer of Spooks agreed, further stating that the episode [...] "deals with very real stuff that's happening in the world. It touches nerves on a regular basis, and deals with uncomfortable truths." [...] Brenton meanwhile stated that [...] "people are free <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> they want of drama," [...] and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture, religion, world or profession. Oyelowo had said that the episode did not say that all Muslims are terrorists, only that some fanatics can give [...] "millions of good people a bad name." [...] The actor also believed that the Muslims who were [...] "up in arms" [...] about the story did not see the episode, but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists.|$|E

One diary was that of John Rabe, a German Nazi Party member who was the leader of the Nanking Safety Zone, a demilitarized zone in Nanjing that Rabe and other Westerners set up to protect Chinese civilians. [...] The other diary belonged to Minnie Vautrin, the American missionary who saved the lives of about 10,000 women and children when she provided them with shelter in Ginling College. [...] The diaries documented the events of the Nanking Massacre from the perspectives of their writers, and provided detailed accounts of atrocities that they saw, as well as information surrounding the circumstances of the Nanking Safety Zone. Chang dubbed Rabe the [...] "Oskar Schindler of Nanking" [...] and Vautrin the [...] "Anne Frank of Nanking". [...] Rabe's diary is over 800 pages, and contains one of the most detailed accounts of the Nanking Massacre.

500|$|French artist Stéphane Sednaoui {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Possibly Maybe". Curiously, that song is about his failed relationship with Björk. The singer {{and the director}} had previously worked together in the iconic music video for [...] "Big Time Sensuality". In the clip, she appears [...] "as a goddess, floating out from a numinous light-streaked background." [...] Sednaoui is known for having a particularly filmic technique for each of his clips; in [...] "Possibly Maybe", the use of blacklighting [...] "makes Björk glow sensuously and perversely". It was conceived in a theatrical way: {{nearly all of the}} scenes were filmed in the same space, which is transformed with changes in the mise en scène. The style of [...] "Possibly Maybe"'s scenery and Björk's wardrobe reference East Asian imagery, and a Japanese traditional doll is featured as Björk's only accompaniment; as a silent witness, it is the object on which the protagonist casts reflections on her own identity. For the [...] "I Miss You" [...] music video, Björk contacted John Kricfalusi of Spümcø to make the animation, as she had long been an admirer of his Ren & Stimpy cartoons. The first edition of Telegraph, a fan magazine directed by Sjón, read: [...] "To the horror of parents everywhere two of the most disturbed minds in show business [...] come together <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> they promise will be the silliest, most demoralizing and, as some depraved souls will undoubtedly say, funniest music video ever!" [...] The colourful clip was done in Ren & Stimpy animation style, and was promptly censored on MTV because of its nudity and violence.|$|E
500|$|However, {{at other}} times, Kyle is an {{enthusiastic}} participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually being nice to Kyle in some instances; {{although this is}} generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael [...] "Meathead" [...] Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>what</b> he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation {{in this regard is}} not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode [...] "" [...] (season 11, 2007). This obsession has also proven itself to actually trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in [...] "Christian Rock Hard" [...] Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a platinum album before Kyle can. After recruiting Butters and Token, Cartman creates a Christian rock band called [...] "Faith+1" [...] and [...] "writes" [...] Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as [...] "baby" [...] with [...] "Jesus" [...] (which humorously implicates sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large fan base as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the [...] "Myrrh" [...] album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an Anti-Christian rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak when concerning Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.|$|E
