25|$|After the Eagles broke up, {{the former}} members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, owned {{the rights to}} solo albums created {{by members of the}} Eagles (though several of them moved to {{different}} labels in ensuing years). Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, before and during his time with the Eagles, but it was uncharted waters for the others. Walsh released a successful album in 1981, <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>the</b> Neighborhood, but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s, such as Got Any Gum? were less well received. During this period Walsh performed as a session musician for Dan Fogelberg, Steve Winwood, John Entwistle, Richard Marx and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, among others, and produced and co-wrote Ringo Starr's Old Wave album.|$|E
25|$|Born in London, Niven {{attended}} Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe before {{gaining a}} place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Having developed an interest in acting, he left the army, travelled to Hollywood and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>the</b> Bride (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non-speaking role in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Mutiny on the Bounty. This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Crow {{released}} The Globe Sessions. During this period, she {{discussed in}} interviews having {{gone through a}} deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, [...] "My Favorite Mistake," [...] was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend. Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling Billboard Magazine on the release of her album, [...] "Oh, there will be just so much speculation, {{and because of that}} there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know. I'm really private about who I've had relationships with, and I don't talk about them in the press. I don't even really talk about them with the people around me." [...] Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, [...] "My favorite single is 'My Favorite Mistake.' It {{was a lot of fun}} to record and it's still a lot of fun to play." [...] The album won Best Rock Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine," [...] which was included on the soundtrack of the film Big Daddy. The song won the 1999 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Other singles included [...] "There Goes the Neighborhood," [...] "Anything but Down," [...] and [...] "The Difficult Kind." [...] Crow won the 2001 Grammy best female rock vocal performance for <b>There</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>the</b> Neighborhood. The Globe Sessions peaked at No.5 on the Billboard 200 chart, achieving US sales of 2 million as of January 2008.|$|E
