Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E
25|$|One scenario, {{in which}} there is {{absolutely}} no wind (air movement), corresponds to a field of zero-vectors.

In the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft.

25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually breathed in turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the critical pressure for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and highly reliable when done correctly, but relatively heavy on task loading.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, to {{rationalize}} sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates {{that the brain}} utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity. In this case, orientation is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the retina, irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as slant and distance. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source {{could be used to}} tweak the accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{some heavy}} {{promotion}} the black comedy approach {{was not what}} audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of The New Temperatures Rising Shows thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, [...] "...the audience didn't buy <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> They just didn't get it.

500|$|On Folie à Deux, Fall Out Boy {{continued}} its pattern of musical experimentation that {{began on the}} band's previous album, Infinity on High. Singer/guitarist Patrick Stump was once again the primary composer, and attempted to create compositions that echoed the themes discussed in Wentz's lyrics. As the lyrical content shifted in new directions from the group's previous works, the musical style employed by the other band members evolved as well.

500|$|The {{series was}} given a budget of $100 million (£58 million), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series.

[...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He said, People think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think it was like <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> If you go to Pompeii, you're struck by how garish it is, even now.

Think of it as a combination of New York and Calcutta, with insane wealth and insane poverty. It was pretty extreme.|$|E

500|$|After {{being placed}} in {{detention}} together, Lana and Sky came {{to know each other}} better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of Neighbours, Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling [...] "a story about tolerance." [...] The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer, [...] "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, and we were very aware of that as we were writing her out.

Almost a year later, Disney {{announced}} that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be [...] "dead and buried." [...] Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa, and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence. Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him [...] "angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes. While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk. Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves, and Damian O'Hare as Lt. Gilette. Keith Richards also had a cameo, reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World's End; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder. Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films.
