40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{are one of}} the {{instruments}} a government can use to implement specific tax policies. In many cases, subsidies and <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are close substitutes. However, <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are less transparent since they are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as subsidies are. The paper first presents the basic issues of tax expenditures: definition, discussion of the « benchmark tax system » from which <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> derogates, reporting practice and recent figures and trends. We then turn to the economic analysis of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures.</b> While there is a clear case for <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the case of externalities and market imperfections, the pro and cons of departing neutrality should be clearly assessed when <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are used in other circumstances. The paper also documents the effects of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> on the distribution of the tax burden. Empirical evidence shows that the take-up of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> by households concentrates on the right-hand side of income distribution and lowers the progressivity of income tax. The final section discusses the economic implications of some tax expenditures: tax credits favouring long-term savings, exempted savings accounts and preferential tax regime for corporate income <b>tax.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>expenditures,</b> <b>tax</b> policy...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year the}} Australian Federal Treasury {{releases}} its <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement providing details of concessions, benefits, and incentives delivered through the tax regime to Australian taxpayers. The current <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement, released on 25 January 2008, lists approximately 300 <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> and {{reports on the}} estimated pecuniary value in terms of revenue foregone, estimated to be a total of $ 50. 12 billion for the 2006 - 07 financial year. Apart from the annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement, and despite the recurring fiscal impact, {{there is very little}} other scrutiny of Australia’s Federal <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> program. This is despite <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> often being seen as an alternative to direct expenditures with similar impact on the Federal budget. The object of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> is to provide government assistance and meet government objectives, and, as such, <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are departures from the revenue raising aspect of the tax regime. Within this context, this article examines the fundamental concept of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> as contrasted with direct expenditures and considers the role they play in the current tax regime...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{those whose}} {{employer}} pays for health insurance, the employee {{may be required}} to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company. [...] The government subsidizes the employer-based insurance by excluding premiums paid by employers from the employees income. This subsidy <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> reduced federal tax revenue by $248 billion in 2013, or 1.5% GDP.|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} of employer-based coverage (as opposed to single-payer or government-funded via individual taxes) is that employers facing increasing healthcare costs offset the expense by either paying relatively less or hiring fewer workers. Since health insurance benefits paid by employers are not treated as income to employees, the government foregoes a sizable amount of tax revenue each year. This subsidy or <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> was estimated by CBO at $281 billion in 2017. On March 1, 2010, billionaire investor Warren Buffett {{said that the}} high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on health care with the 9% of GDP spent by {{much of the rest}} of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, [...] "hat kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body." ...|$|E
50|$|The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (hereafter JCT) {{annually}} estimates tax {{expenditures in}} terms of revenues lost to the U.S. Treasury for each special tax provision included in the U.S. tax code. In 2009, the JCT listed over 180 <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> programs that cost the U.S. government over $1 trillion in revenues. Their cost varies {{with the level of}} economic activity. A major <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> is enjoyed by tax payers who own their own home and can deduct the interest on their mortgage payments. Since tax expenditures are claimed against a progressive tax code, individual <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> programs are worth more to wealthier taxpayers.

40|$|The current Australian Treasury {{approach}} to <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> management and reporting is a culmination of 36 years of Government and Parliamentary reviews and reports. The most notable outcome of these reviews and reports is {{the publication of}} the annual <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> statement, which commenced in 1986. Since its inception, the Australian annual <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> statements have themselves been the subject of review. Most recently, the Australian National Audit Office has undertaken a performance audit in the Department of the Treasury and released its report entitled Preparation of the <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement. In addition to this 2008 report, a second recent opportunity to consider <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> within the Australian tax regime has arisen. The Australian tax system is currently undergoing a comprehensive and broad review with the terms of reference requiring a consideration of all relevant <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures.</b> While the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office are not novel, and {{it is not unusual for}} a broader review to consider the role of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> within the Australian tax system, both the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office and the views of the current Review Panel take on a renewed sense of importance given the proliferation of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Australia. <b>Tax</b> <b>expenditures,</b> in terms of number and pecuniary value, have increased significantly in Australia in recent years. The latest <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement lists around 320 <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> with the pecuniary value of those expenditures estimated at $ 73. 69 billion or 7. 1 % of GDP.

5000|$|Tax {{expenditures}} are considered [...] "off-budget" [...] spending by most economists and budget experts. Tax {{expenditures are}} easier to pass through Congress than increases in appropriations spending. They are easily seen as free benefits, when government grants are viewed as giveaways. Unlike direct spending, tax spending must only pass through two committees, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance. <b>Tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> programs, once in the tax code, do not come up for annual review and can only be removed through tax legislation. <b>Tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> programs are a form of entitlement spending in that every tax payer that qualifies can claim government money. Faricy (2011) demonstrated that when tax expenditures are counted {{as a type of}} government spending, Democratic and Republican parties are indistinguishable in annual changes to federal government spending. This study also finds that Republicans are more likely to increase tax expenditures when in control of government thereby subsidizing the activities of businesses and the wealthy. Jacob Hacker (2002) shows that the federal subsidization of private health insurance has grown over the years and has made efforts for nationalized health care more difficult. Ellis and Faricy (2011) find that when tax expenditures rise, public opinion adjusts and becomes more liberal to counteract the conservative policies.|$|E

The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 (CBA) defines tax expenditures as [...] "those revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability" [...] (Surrey 1985).
