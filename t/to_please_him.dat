25|$|The Rev. Mr. Leslie, of Castlebellingham, who {{threatened}} the Gaelic league with his wrath for daring {{to hold a}} Feis on Sunday, has, we regret to say, found an imitator in a Catholic clergyman {{at the other side}} of Ireland – the Rev. Father Donor, of Shanagolden. This gentleman acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a week day, with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} series, Baldrick's {{attempts}} {{to raise his}} social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Fortunately, Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and clearly has desire <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> Unfortunately, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed {{for a short period}} of time when Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick was able to get into the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.|$|E

500|$|The Fox Network series House {{represented}} an [...] "asexual" [...] {{couple in the}} episode [...] "Better Half". However, this representation has been questioned {{by members of the}} asexual community (including AVEN founder, David Jay) due to the episode concluding in the reveal that the man simply had a pituitary tumor that reduced his sex drive, and the woman was only pretending to be asexual <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> This led to controversy over the representation and a change.org petition for Fox Network to reconsider how it represents asexual characters in the future, stating it [...] "represented asexuality very poorly by attributing it to both medical illness and deception." ...|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{experienced}} an unhappy and solitary childhood. He was considered precocious, docile and obedient, but frequently cried and often nothing seemed <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> He [...] "was not raised in luxury {{and everything was}} very simple." [...] As his sisters could not accompany him at other times, he only had permission to meet them after lunch, and even then for only one hour. He had few friends of his age, {{and the only one}} he retained into adulthood was Luís Pedreira do Couto Ferraz, future Viscount of Bom Retiro. However, he was treated tenderly by Mariana de Verna and also by Rafael, who played with him by carrying him on his shoulders and who also allowed Pedro II to hide in his room to escape from studies. For the greater part of his time, he was surrounded by servants who only had permission to speak to him when questioned. The environment in which Pedro II was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw in [...] "books another world where he could isolate and protect himself." [...] Behind the [...] "pomp of the monarchy, of the self-sufficient appearance, there must have lived an unhappy man." ...|$|E

500|$|Since the 1940s, Khrushchev had {{advocated}} {{the cultivation of}} corn (maize) in the Soviet Union. He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands. In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to insist on visiting Garst's large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR [...] of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn {{in the southern part}} of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who [...] "would have us plant the whole planet with corn", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a Latvian kolkhoz, he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, [...] "Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?" [...] He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and [...] "as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I".|$|E

Moreover, he has a faculty for getting the most out of players, not because he is a driver, for he isn't that sort, but because they like him and will do their utmost <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him</b> by playing hard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece".

[...] Though the impetus for Maria's works, Mr. Edgeworth has been criticised for his insistence on approving and editing her work.

2500|$|In 1861, Suslova {{attended}} the classes taught by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, already a renowned writer, whose lectures were very popular among young people. At that time, Dostoyevsky was 40, {{and she was}} 21. Daughter Lyubov Dostoyevskaya (who was born several years later, well after the affair {{had come to an}} end) opined that Suslova [...] "spun around Dostoevsky and tried <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him</b> in every way, but Dostoevsky did not notice her. Then she wrote him a love letter". Another version is that Suslova brought her writings to Dostoyevsky and asked for advice. Her story was bad, but Dostoyevsky was attracted to a beautiful young girl and promised to teach her writing. Yet another explanation is that Dostoyevsky had read Suslova's story, liked it and wanted to meet the author.|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again. I could use a new centerpiece." ...|$|E

As to the navigation which the latter wished to undertake to Nueva España and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose, to build ships for that voyage, that was a matter which [...] although the governor would do his best to effect, and <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him</b> in everything [...] was not within his control, without first informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva España thereof; for he, the governor, had no power or authority outside of the affairs of his government of the Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|In lines 9-12, {{the poet}} {{attempts}} {{to quell the}} torment of day and night by using flattery. In line 9, when the poet writes [...] "when I tell the day, <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>him</b> thou art bright", 'him' {{is indicative of the}} day while 'thou' is the beloved. Another example of flattery can be observed in line 10, when the poet assures day that he is not dull [...] "because the beloved’s brightness makes him beautiful, gracing him." [...] Furthermore, when the evening sky appears grim and starless, the poet uses flattery by telling him that evening is [...] "gilded by the beloved." [...] In lines 11 and 12, the word [...] "'night', not 'evening', is required by logic, but 'even' is imposed by rhyme" [...] – a proclamation that [...] "the evening star is the brightest star in the sky." [...] Furthermore, the poet again attempts to appease his torturers in line 11 by referring to night as 'swart-complexioned'. The poet's adulation is counterfeit, as he knows that a starless night is unattractive, but this admission enables Shakespeare to [...] "insert into the poem a flash of praise of the beloved, whose brightness graces a dull day and gilds a dull evening." ...|$|E
