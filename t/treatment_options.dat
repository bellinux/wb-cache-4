5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis. Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug <b>treatment</b> <b>options</b> {{and the expansion}} of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD. There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, partly as a residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.|$|E
50|$|An oral dose {{of aspirin}} is being {{investigated}} as a potential <b>treatment</b> <b>option</b> for people with venous ulcers.

50|$|It {{is usually}} {{recommended}} when an abfraction lesion {{is less than}} 1 millimeter, monitoring at regular intervals is a sufficient <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b> If there are concerns around aesthetics or clinical consequences such as dentinal hypersensitivity, a dental restoration (white filling) may be a suitable <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different <b>treatment</b> <b>options</b> have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has taken}} many steps towards slowing {{the spread of}} HIV/AIDS, such as {{increasing}} access to condoms and improving testing services and <b>treatment</b> <b>options.</b> Many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including the World Bank, the Global Fund, the World Health Organization, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS). The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the Global Fund has agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different <b>treatment</b> <b>options.</b> Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} evaluate therapeutic {{success of}} the ketogenic diet (KD) as a <b>treatment</b> <b>option</b> for epilepsy.

5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard <b>treatment</b> <b>options</b> for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the <b>treatment</b> <b>options.</b> In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>treatment</b> <b>options</b> for acne are available, {{including}} lifestyle changes, medications, {{and medical}} procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E

2500|$|An {{additional}} possible <b>treatment</b> <b>option</b> {{for those}} afflicted with the symptom is neurostimulation. Studies have begun, and in cerebral palsy patients affected with dystonia-choreoathetosis, {{it has been}} demonstrated that neurostimulation has been an effective treatment in lessening symptoms in patients. [...] There {{has not been a}} tremendous amount of experimentation, though, in this as a possible <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b>|$|R

5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. <b>Treatment</b> <b>options</b> are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line <b>treatment</b> <b>options</b> with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} held that {{insurance}} discourages people from taking diagnostic tests since such tests can turn up information {{that leads to}} uninsurability. We develop a model in which some consumers are initially informed of their risk type and others are uninformed, {{and there is a}} <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b> People decide whether to be tested, uninformed insurers offer contracts, and consumers select their contract and chose treatment. We show that testing is encouraged when information status and test results are restricted. Because the private value of information revealed by the test is positive, the uninformed take the test when the subsequent insurance market attains a Rothchild-Stiglitz equilibrium. The positive private value stems from the <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b> We also show that the social value of information revealed in diagnostic tests is positive with or without a <b>treatment</b> <b>option.</b> Thus, market mechanisms provide optimal incentives for acquiring hidden knowledge when there is a <b>treatment</b> <b>option...</b>|$|R
