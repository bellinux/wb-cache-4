5000|$|The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is {{the primary}} federal law {{governing}} debt collection practices. The FDCPA allows aggrieved consumers to file private lawsuits against a collection agency that violates the Act. Alternatively, the Federal Trade Commission or {{the state attorney general}} may take action against a noncompliant collection agency, including issuing fines, ordering damages, restricting its operations or even closing it down (see, e.g., CAMCO). Section 809 of the Act directs that for disputed debts [...] "the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt". When consumers resort to lawsuits against collectors who fail <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> <b>debts,</b> the collector is liable for the complainant's legal costs if the debt is found to be bogus.|$|E
40|$|The {{petition}} for certiorari to the Maryland Court of Appeals by Loren Parker concerned {{the interpretation of}} Maryland Rule of Evidence 5 - 902, specifically the authentication of business records by debt buyers. The central issue was whether a debt purchaser is bound by the same rules of evidence for the admissibility of business records as other Maryland businesses. Rule 5 - 902 (b) provides for the self-authentication of records of a regularly conducted business activity. It requires that a party served with a 5 - 902 (b) notice must object within 5 days. The petitioner debtor argued that this rule was being abused by debt buyers, like Pasadena, who often did nothing <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> the <b>debt.</b> Business records have to be properly authenticated by someone {{with knowledge of the}} business to overcome hearsay objections. The amicus memorandum argues that debt buyers {{should not be allowed to}} self-authenticate the business records of a third party (the original creditor) as if those records were their own. It points out that the failure to object within five days does not bar other objections to the records at the time of trial. Also, any authenticating witness must have personal knowledge of the business, otherwise he or she is not competent to testify. Since the debt buyer has no personal knowledge of the business records practice of the creditor grantor, or of each intermediate debt buyer, it cannot lay a proper foundation for the admission of documents created by other entities. The memoranda urges the grant of certiorari to provide clarity to consumers and businesses about the requirements for self-authentication of records created by third-party predecessors in interest...|$|R

Whereas DFCU Bank offered to clear all of Crane Bank's <b>verified</b> <b>debts,</b> Aethel Partners insisted it would clear {{only part of the}} failed lender's debts because of the severe corporate governance and financial risks tied to the bank.
