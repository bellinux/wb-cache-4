5|$|In {{order to}} stop the Man in Black from leaving the island, Richard {{suggests}} that they destroy the Ajira plane. After Ilana is killed while holding dynamites, Frank goes to the Black Rock with the group {{in order to get}} more dynamite. However, Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks; destroying all the dynamite supplies.

25|$|Roberts and Davies held an {{unofficial}} contest {{to see how}} many references to Christie's works could be inserted. Titles that were noted were: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Why Didn't They Ask Evans; The Body in the Library; The Secret Adversary; N or M?; Nemesis; Cat Among the Pigeons; Dead Man's Folly; They Do It With Mirrors; Appointment with Death; Cards on the Table; Sparkling Cyanide; Endless Night; Crooked House; Death in the Clouds; The Moving Finger; Taken at the Flood; Death Comes as the End; Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder at the Vicarage. A deleted scene referred <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the Brown Suit, referring to the Doctor's clothing. The narrative itself parallels several of Christie's novels: the jewel theft storyline parallels The Secret of Chimneys; Miss Chandrakala's death was influenced by And Then There Were None; and the Colonel's revelation that he was not disabled paralleled a key concept of The Pale Horse. In an email conversation with journalist Benjamin Cook, Davies admitted he had initially added a reference to the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, but decided it was too risky.|$|E
500|$|When Hurley, Jack, and Richard {{join their}} group, Miles is {{particularly}} happy to greet Hurley. [...] A few days later, Richard decides their {{mission is to}} stop the Man in Black from escaping; they are to destroy the Ajira Airways Flight 316 on the other Island, dubbed [...] "Hydra Island," [...] so that the Man in Black stays trapped in the area. However, Hurley destroys the remaining dynamite from an old ship shipwrecked on the Island, thinking it will save everyone. [...] The disagreement between Richard and Hurley splits the group into two: Hurley's party will go talk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Black, while Richard's party will search for more explosives. [...] Miles decides to follow Richard and Ben, telling Hurley that he has seen [...] "that thing in action," [...] and that it doesn't want to talk.|$|E

500|$|Leipheimer {{would fall}} from a podium {{position}} days later, though. After stages won by sprinters and breakaways, Stage 16, with a summit finish at Monte Petrano, {{was the next}} real test for riders aiming for the General Classification. Leipheimer was dropped by other leading riders on the climb and wound up losing almost three minutes on the stage, to fall to sixth overall. With their GC hopes all but dashed, Astana decided to try for stage wins on the remaining mountain days in the Giro. Armstrong attacked on Stage 17 and got clear of the leading group, {{but was unable to}} bridge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> first position on the road, Franco Pellizotti, who {{went on to win the}} stage. Ultimately, Astana did not win any stage at the Giro, but they did win the Trofeo Fast Team, beating [...] by over 24 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Idolator's {{staff members}} wrote that [...] "Dance for You" [...] is a [...] "dangerously slick slow-jam". Similarly, [...] Carrie Batta of Pitchfork Media {{commented that the}} song is an [...] "impeccable slow jam". Describing the song as [...] "saucy", Pip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus wrote that [...] "Dance for You" [...] {{is the best of}} the three deluxe tracks. Natalie Finn of E! Online {{described}} the song as a [...] "come-hither love letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> her life, set to a sultry beat". By contrast, Joshua Glossner of The Daily Collegian found the song to be too lengthy, adding, [...] "Well I hope she hurries up and shows him how much she loves him before the eternity-long track is done." [...] He further noted that [...] "Dance For You" [...] immediately reminded him of Ciara's [...] "Promise" [...] (2006). Marc Hogan of Spin magazine found [...] "Dance for You" [...] to be [...] "a sort of strip-club jam set, as {{with the rest of the}} album". He added that the song would fit squarely on a track by The Weeknd, owing to [...] "the bluesy guitar and smoky organ". However, he concluded that [...] "it's not exactly worth plunking down another 32 bucks for". Danielle Cheesman of MSN Music showed high favoritism for [...] "Dance for You", writing: ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics of {{marriage}} {{argue that it}} is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse of women. They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm of male-female interaction: subordination of the woman <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> exchange of subsistence. According to Sheila Jeffreys [...] "the traditional elements {{of marriage}} have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women". She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women [...] "feel they {{have no choice but to}} stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive".|$|E
