5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>association</b> could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian Ski Federation {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Association</b> for the Promotion of Skiing arrange slalom {{as part of}} the Holmenkollen Ski Festival, but {{the plans}} were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing to be introduced in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while the downhill was carried out at Norefjell Ski Resort in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether human {{associations}} to verbs as {{collected in}} a web experiment can help us to identify salient verb features for semantic verb classes. Assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> model aspects of verb meaning, we apply a clustering to the verbs, as based on <b>the</b> <b>associations,</b> and validate <b>the</b> resulting verb classes against standard approaches to semantic verb classes, i. e. GermaNet and FrameNet. Then, various clusterings of the same verbs are performed {{on the basis of}} standard corpus-based types, and evaluated against the association-based clustering as well as GermaNet and FrameNet classes. We hypothesise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> corpus-based clusterings are better if the instantiations of the feature types show more overlap with <b>the</b> verb <b>associations,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> therefore help to identify salient feature types...|$|R
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>association</b> of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this alone does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>association</b> arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|At {{conferences}} in 1946 and 1947, {{the decision was}} made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced. The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>association</b> maintained 100percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale breed show was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily.|$|E

On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Association</b> had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, in {{the later}} Victorian period, {{adoption}} of 'gothic' designs came to suggest an association with nature, rather than with western Christian architecture.

Over time, Quetzalcoatl's appearance, clothing, malevolent nature, and status among the gods were reshaped to fit a more Christian framework.|$|E
