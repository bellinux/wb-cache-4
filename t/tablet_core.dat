50|$|It is {{sometimes}} necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters. Tablets {{are easier to}} break accurately if scored, but there are devices called pill-splitters which cut unscored and scored tablets. Tablets with special coatings (for example enteric coatings or controlled-release coatings) should not be broken before use, as this will expose the <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> to the digestive juices, circumventing the intended delayed-release effect.|$|E
40|$|Aspirin {{is apt to}} hydrolyze. In {{order to}} improve its stability, a new method has been {{developed}} involving the application of hot-melt sub- and outercoating combined with enteric aqueous coating. The main aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of these factors on the stability of ASA and understand how they work. Satisfactory storage stability were obtained when the aspirin <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> coated with Eudragit L 30 D 55 film was combined with glycerin monostearate (GMS) as an outercoat. Hygroscopicity testing indicated that the moisture penetrating into the tablet may result in a significant change in the physical properties of the coating film observed by scanning electron microscopy. Investigation of the compatibility between the drug and film excipients shows that the talc and methacrylic acid had a significant catalytic effect on ASA. A hypothesis was proposed that the hydrolysis of ASA enteric coated tablets (ASA-ECT) was mostly concentrated in the internal film and the interfaces between the film and <b>tablet</b> <b>core.</b> In conclusion, hot-melt coating technology is an alternative to subcoating or outercoating. Also, GMS sub-coating was a better choice for forming a stable barrier between the <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> and the polymer coating layer, and increases the structure and chemical stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissolution}} {{profile of}} orally delivered drugs {{can be controlled}} {{through the use of}} osmotically controlled drug delivery devices. The most commonly used device is the osmotic tablet, which is essentially a <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> that is coated with a rate-limiting semipermeable membrane. The feasibility of applying a coating onto a tablet using dense gas techniques was studied. Two different coating materials, polymethymethacrylate (PMMA, Mw = 120, 000 g/mol) and cellulose acetate (CA, 39. 8 wt% acetyl content) were applied onto an 8 mm osmotic <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> using the Gas Anti-solvent (GAS) process. For PMMA, the pressurisation rate, coating temperature and volumetric expansion of up to 250 % had minimal effect on the coating quality. The concentration, solvent type and the use of polyethylene glycol (Mw = 200 g/mol) had a more pronounced effect on the coating. The coating process was optimised to apply a smooth and uniform coating with a 50 µm thickness. For CA, the pressurisation rate and the coating temperature had little effect on the coating that was applied. The process was more sensitive to a change in the concentration of the solution and the volumetric expansion that was used. It was found that the concentration could not be increased too much without affecting the coating quality. A CA coating was applied onto a PMMA-coated tablet using the optimised conditions. The thickness in the tablet coating increased by 10 µm. Dissolution tests of the uncoated and coated tablets were carried out. The CA coatings were found to be insufficient in limiting the rate of water entering the tablet and performed similarly to an uncoated <b>tablet</b> <b>core.</b> The PMMA coatings were found to limit the rate of delivery of the model drug. However, variations in the PMMA coatings resulted in an inconsistent delivery profile across batches. The tablets coated with both PMMA and CA had a delivery rate in between that of uncoated and PMMA-coated tablets, indicating that the application of the second coating had compromised the initial PMMA coating...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to produce a quick/slow biphasic delivery system for aceclofenac. A dual component tablet made of a sustained release <b>tabletted</b> <b>core</b> and an immediate release tabletted coat was prepared by direct compression. Both the core and the coat contained a model drug aceclofenac. The sustained release effect was achieved with polymers hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ethylcellulose and Xanthan gum to sustain the release of drug. The in-vitro drug release profile from these tablets showed the desired biphasic release behavior of aceclofenac, where the fast releasing component was dissolved within 30 minutes and the drug in the <b>core</b> <b>tablet</b> was released over a period of 12 hours from the matrix tablets. It was observed that Xanthan gum is a better release retarding agent than HPMC and ethyl cellulose as it delayed the release of the drug for more than 15 hrs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the change of surface roughness and the development of the film during the film coating process using laser profilometer roughness measurements, SEM imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Surface roughness and texture changes developing during the process of film coating tablets were studied by noncontact laser profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An EDX analysis was used to monitor the magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide of the <b>tablets.</b> The <b>tablet</b> <b>cores</b> were film coated with aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and the film coating was performed using an instrumented pilot-scale side-vented drum coater. The SEM images of the film-coated tablets showed that within the first 30 minutes, the surface of the <b>tablet</b> <b>cores</b> was completely covered with a thin film. The magnesium signal that was monitored by SEM-EDX disappeared after ∼ 15 to 30 minutes, indicating that the tablet surface was homogeneously covered with film coating. The surface roughness started to increase from the beginning of the coating process, and the increase in the roughness broke off after 30 minutes of spraying. The results clearly showed that the surface roughness of the tablets increased until the film coating covered the whole surface area of the tablets, corresponding to a coating time period of 15 to 30 minutes (from the beginning of the spraying phase). Thereafter, the film only became thicker. The methods used in this study were applicable in the visualization of the changes caused by the film coating on the tablet surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of drug release from push-pull osmotic systems (PPOS) {{has been investigated}} by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using a new benchtop apparatus. The signal intensity profiles of both PPOS layers were monitored non-invasively over time to characterize the hydration and swelling kinetics. The drug release performance was well-correlated to the hydration kinetics. The results show that (i) hydration and swelling critically depend on the <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> composition, (ii) high osmotic pressure developed by the push layer may lead to bypassing the drug layer and incomplete drug release and (iii) the hydration of both the drug and the push layers needs to be properly balanced to efficiently deliver the drug.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the influence of the following superdisintegrants Ac-Di-Sol, crospovidone and Primojel, in tablets containing a model hydrolyzable drug on the effect of moisture penetration into the <b>tablet</b> <b>cores</b> and the drug stability after aqueous tablet coating. ^ In order to understand the moisture uptake process, the superdisintegrants and tablets made from the superdisintegrants were characterized for their physical properties as well as the coating solutions used. The results of characterization of the superdisintegrants and the tablets showed that the superdisintegrants differ in their mechanisms of action as crospovidone attracted water by the formation of a network of pores, Primojel attracted water by swelling in contact with water and Ac-Di-Sol attracted water by the formation of a network of pores and swelling. The results of characterization of the coating solutions showed that viscosity played the major role in the penetration of water into the <b>tablets</b> <b>cores</b> as it influences coating solution penetration rate and atomization of the coating solution. ^ In order to understand the hydrolyzable drug stability, solid state stability studies of mixtures of the drug and the superdisintegrants were conducted. The results of the solid stability studies demonstrated that moisture is not the only factor that affects the stability of the hydrolyzable drug. Superdisintegrants influenced the surface pH of the mixture which depends on the moisture level and will also affect stability of the drug. ^ During the aqueous coating, all tablets showed significant increase in moisture content and a decrease in the stability of the hydrolyzable drug. The different tablet formulations showed differences in moisture penetration and stability as determined by moisture content, tablet hardness, and tablet physical dimension measurements and drug stability. The differences depended on the various physical or chemical properties of the disintegrant and the coating solutions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to achieve colon specific delivery of sennosides using the polysaccharide pectin as a compression-coating agent. In this study, pectin along with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose was used for compression coating of the <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> of calcium sennoside. Drug dissolution and erosion studies were carried out in pH 1. 2 and phosphate buffer pH 7. 4 using a pectinolytic enzyme. The system was designed based on the gastrointestinal transit time concept, assuming colon arrival time to be 6 h. It was found that pectin alone was not sufficient to protect the <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> during entire gastrointestinal transit time. Addition of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose was required to control the erosion of tablets. In this investigation a 3 2 factorial design was constructed to investigate the influence of two variables; the amount of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (X 1) and coat weight of the tablets (X 2) on the time taken for 50 &#x 0025; erosion of tablet in presence of pectinase enzyme (TE 50) and average percent weight difference between tablets with and without enzyme at the 10 th hour (&#x 0025; WD).

Thermal conductivity measurements in conjunction with intensity histogram analysis indicated that differentiation across the coat/core interface was possible, with a bimodal distribution of pixel intensities corresponding to thermal conductivity noted. Localised thermal analysis studies indicated that the bulk response was dominated by the incorporated ibuprofen, with a discontinuity seen at ca. 70 – 80 °C, corresponding to the published melting point of the drug. The coat showed a discontinuity at ca. 220 °C that may be reasonably ascribed to the melting process. It was also noted that the coat showed a small discontinuity at a temperature corresponding to the melting of ibuprofen. In summary, the technique was shown to be capable of identifying the core/coat interface using thermal conductivity measurements, while localised thermal analysis experiments enable the operator to perform thermal analysis experiments on the individual components in situ...|$|E

The film coating takes up water when below the pH-threshold. However, this did not cause early disintegration of the coating. The ColoPulse technology is successfully applied on tablets.

Nine formulae were designed to determine the optimal formula of the <b>core</b> <b>tablet.</b> Eudragit L 100 was used to prepare the CCMS enteric-coated tablets. The effect of enteric coated formulation variables such as content of talc (10 %, 25 % and 40 %), plasticisers (TEC and DBS), dosage of plasticiser (10 %, 20 % and 30 %) and coating weight (2 %, 3 % and 5 %) were evaluated for drug release characteristics. The in vitro release was studied using 0. 1 N HCl and pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer. Enteric coated tablets without ruptures or swelling behaviour over 2 h in 0. 1 N HCl indicated that these tablets showed acid resistance.

40|$|The aim was {{to design}} a pH-sensitive pulsatile drug {{delivery}} system that allows for an on–off pulsed release of a drug using polyacrylic acid (PAA) blended with ethyl cellulose (EC) in different ratios. PAA, a polyelectrolyte polymer, exhibits a highly coiled conformation at low pH but a highly extended structure at high pH. Fumaric acid, which is an internal acidifying agent, was incorporated into the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-based <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> to create an acidic microenvironmental pH (pHM). The concentration of fumaric acid inside the <b>core</b> <b>tablet</b> and the ratio of PAA/EC in the coating layer were very crucial in modulating drug release behaviors. When the fumaric acid was retained in the <b>core</b> <b>tablet,</b> it gave a more acidic pHM, so that the PAA was kept in a highly coiled state in the coated film, which hindered drug release (“off” release pattern). Interestingly, the release profiles of the drug and fumaric acid from coated tablets showed the on–off pulsed pattern upon dissolution.

40|$|A small release cell, in {{the form}} of a {{rotating}} disc, has been constructed to fit into the MRI equipment. The present work show that both qualitative and quantitative information of the swelling and erosion behavior of hydrophilic extended release (ER) matrix tablets may be obtained using this release cell and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies at different time-points during matrix dissolution. The tablet size, core size and the gel layer thickness of ER matrix formulations based on poly(ethylene oxide) have been determined. The dimensional changes as a function of time were found to correspond well to observations made with texture analysis (TA) methodology. Most importantly, the results of the present study show that both the erosion (displacement of the gel-dissolution media interface) and the swelling (decrease of dry <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> size) proceed with a faster rate in radial than in axial direction using the rotating disk set-up. This behavior was attributed to the higher shear forces experienced in the radial direction. The results also indicate that front synchronization (constant gel layer thickness) is associated with the formation of an almost constant polymer concentration profile through the gel layer at different time-points.

Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal agent with powerful analgesic. Oral bioavailability of ketorolac was reported to be 90 % with very low hepatic ϐirst-pass elimination; the biological half-life of 4 - 6 hours requires frequent administration to maintain the therapeutic effect.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature of Supercell coating, an on-line tablet coater that employed a unique pattern of airflow. Tablets coated at different spray rates (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different wetting conditions on the quality of coats formed. Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet coats formed at a spray rate of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a spray rate of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other spray rates, and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together. At higher spray rates, the droplets appeared as branching arms and scale-like structures. This was attributed to the spread of spray droplets by the processing air and mass transfer of wet coating materials between tablets. Further tests showed that coats formed at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the mass transfer of coats and dissolution of <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> surfaces by the coating material. Since coats of different characteristics can be formed in Supercell coating, the choice of wetting conditions would depend on the type of coat required and the coating materials used...|$|E
40|$|Microporous osmotic tablet of {{diltiazem}} hydrochloride {{was developed}} for colon targeting. These prepared microporous osmotic pump tablet did not require laser drilling to deliver the drug to the specific site of action. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. The prepared tablets were coated with microporous semipermeable membrane and enteric polymer using conventional pan coating process. The incorporation of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a leachable pore-forming agent, could form in situ delivery pores while coming in contact with gastrointestinal medium. The effect of formulation variables was studied by changing the amounts of sodium alginate and NaCMC in the <b>tablet</b> <b>core,</b> osmogen, and that of pore-forming agent (SLS) used in the semipermeable coating. As the amount of hydrophilic polymers increased, drug release rate prolonged. It was found that drug release was increased as the concentration of osmogen and pore-former was increased. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Differential scanning calorimetry results showed {{that there was no}} interaction between drug and polymers. Scanning electron microscopic studies showed the formation of pores after predetermined time of coming in contact with dissolution medium. The formation of pores was dependent on the amount of pore former used in the semipermeable membrane. in vitro results showed acid-resistant, timed release at an almost zero order up to 24 hours. The developed osmotic tablets could be effectively used for prolonged delivery of Diltiazem HCl...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Monolayer matrix (MLM) tablet {{and triple}} layer matrix (TLM) tablet {{formulation}} of metoprolol succinate were fabricated by using Hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose and Polymethacrylates (Eudragit) as the matrix forming agent {{in both the}} <b>tablet</b> <b>core</b> layer and barrier layers. The prepared tablets were analyzed for their drug content and in-vitro drug release studies. In-vitro evaluation and comparison of the MLM dosage form and TLM dosage form was done. The role of impermeable barrier layer in controlling the drug release from the core was studied. The in-vitro dissolution {{studies were carried out}} and showed a significant difference statistically (P value > 0. 05 by ANOVA tool). Mean dissolution time (MDT) increased, while dissolution efficiency (DE %) decreased, indicating that the release of metoprolol succinate is slower from triple layer matrix tablets. The thermal analysis studies (DSC) performed on the initial TLM formulation and three month old accelerated stability sample of the same showed no variation in the thermograph, indicating TLM as stable formulation. The finding of the study indicated that the MLM tablets may prolonged the drug release, but a non linear drug release profile was observed with an initial burst release. In TLM tablets, layering with Hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose and Polymethacrylates (Eudragit) as impermeable barrier on the matrix core, resulted in linear/zero order drug release kinetics. The initial burst release was not observed in TLM tablets. TLM tablets showed significant and marked controlled release of a freely water soluble drug as compared to MLM tablets...|$|E
40|$|Colon {{targeted}} {{delivery of}} satranidazole (STZ), which immediately releases the drug {{as soon as}} the drug delivery system reaches the colon was formulated. Different grades of pectin were used as a compression coat and the effect of degree of esterification (DE) of pectin on swelling and drug release property was evaluated. STZ is a sparingly soluble drug, so to obtain maximum effect of drug at the site of action the solubility enhancement was carried out using Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). Pectin as a compression coat was unable to direct STZ containing <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> to the colon, so HPMC was added to increase the tensile strength of the coat. STZ <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> compression coated with High DE pectin: HPMC in 1 : 1 ratio imparted the lag time of 5 h and burst release in colon...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was the design and {{evaluation}} of etodolac controlled porosity osmotic pump (CPOP) tablets exhibiting zero-order release kinetics. Variables influencing the design of (1) <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> viz., (a) osmogent type (sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol, and fructose) and (b) drug/osmogent ratio (1 : 0. 25, 1 : 0. 50, and 1 : 0. 75), and (2) CPOP tablets viz., (a) coating solution composition, (b) weight gain percentage (1 – 5 %, w/w), and (c) pore former concentration (5 %, 10 %, and 20 %, v/v), were investigated. Statistical analysis and kinetic modeling of drug release data were estimated. Fructose-containing <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> showed significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) more retarded drug release rates. An inverse correlation was observed between drug/fructose ratio and drug release rate. Coating of the optimum <b>core</b> <b>tablets</b> (F 4) {{with a mixture of}} cellulose acetate solution (3 %, w/v), diethyl phthalate, and polyethylene glycol 400 (85 : 10 : 5, v/v, respectively) till a 4 % w/w weight gain enabled zero-order sustained drug delivery over 24  h. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of coating membrane confirmed pore formation upon contact with dissolution medium. When compared to the commercial immediate-release Napilac® capsules, the optimum CPOP tablets (F 4 – 34) provided enhanced bioavailability and extended duration of effective etodolac plasma concentration with minimum expected potential for side effects in healthy volunteers...|$|R
40|$|Tadalafil (TDL) a BCS-II drug is {{recently}} reported for repurposing nephroprotective effect in Pyelonephritis (PN). However, poor water solubility and dissolution rate limited oral bioavailability pose serious challenges in its therapeutic applications. We present an advanced third generation Solid Dispersion (SD) of TDL comprising a polymer {{in combination with}} a Self Micro-emulsifying Composition (SMEC) to achieve high drug loading, improved stability and rapid dissolution of TDL for enhancing bioavailability and efficacy in PN. TDL-SMEC-SD was coated onto rapidly disintegrating inert <b>tablet</b> <b>cores</b> which disintegrated rapidly in water to release SD as a film. TDL-SMEC-SD was evaluated for in-vivo oral bioavailability and in-vivo efficacy in lipopolysaccharide-induced PN in rats. TDL exhibited high solubility (45. 6 [*]mg/ml) in the SMEC. TDL-SMEC-SD exhibited remarkably high TDL loading (45 %w/w), exceptionally low contact angle (9 °), rapid in-vitro release (t 50 7. 3 [*]min), microemulsion formation (globule size ~ 100 [*]nm) in aqueous dispersion, and stability as per ICH guidelines. SEM, DSC, and XRD confirmed high physical stability. A relative bioavailability of 350 % and 150 % compared to TDL and TDL-SD without SMEC respectively, established the superiority of TDL-SMEC-SD. A significant reduction in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and nitric oxide levels in the lipopolysaccharide-induced PN confirmed {{the benefit of the}} TDL-SMEC-SD. The advanced third generation SMEC SDs presents the possibility of platform technology for bioenhancement of poorly water soluble drugs...|$|R
