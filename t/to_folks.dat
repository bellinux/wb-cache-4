2500|$|Commander David Carlson, {{commanding}} officer of , the warship stationed nearest to Vincennes {{at the time of}} the incident, is reported [...] to have said that the destruction of the aircraft [...] "marked the horrifying climax to Captain Rogers's aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago". His comment referred to incidents on 2 June, when Rogers had sailed Vincennes too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within [...] of an Iranian small craft despite rules of engagement requiring a four-mile (6.4km) separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented, [...] "Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do." [...] He also said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were [...] "pointedly non-threatening" [...] and professional. At the time of Rogers's announcement to higher command that he was going to shoot down the plane, Carlson is reported [...] to have been thunderstruck: [...] "I said <b>to</b> <b>folks</b> around me, 'Why, what the hell is he doing?' I went through the drill again. F-14. He's climbing. By now this damn thing is at 7,000 feet." [...] Carlson thought Vincennes might have more information, and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving. Carlson is also reported to have written in the U.S. Naval Proceedings that he had [...] "wondered aloud in disbelief" [...] on hearing of Vincenness intentions, speculating that the ship, known as [...] "Robo Cruiser" [...] for its aggressiveness, [...] "felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff." ...|$|E
