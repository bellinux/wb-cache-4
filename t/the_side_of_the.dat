5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} eight 7-inch 45-caliber {{guns were}} distributed four per side, in casemates on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, below the main deck.|$|E

The edge in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest triangle represents a move <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest disk. The edge in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> each next smaller triangle represents a move of each next smaller disk. <b>The</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest triangles represent moves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest disk.|$|R

5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|A {{footbridge}} {{is incorporated}} {{on the eastern}} side and pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles can cross the estuary by <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track. Since 1996, this has formed part of the National Cycle Route that links North and South Wales. The footbridge is owned by Network Rail but an agreement is in place with Gwynedd County Council, who pay for 10% of the annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use the bridge.|$|E
5|$|After the {{beginning}} of Bulgaria's engagement in First World War on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Powers in autumn 1915, many ethnic Albanians joined the Bulgarians who gave them weapons.

Since <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart contains venous blood with a low oxygen content, and <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart contains arterial blood with a high oxygen content, it is beneficial to prevent any communication between <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart and prevent the blood from <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart from mixing with each other.|$|R
5|$|Before her death, Plath tried {{several times}} to take her own life. On August 24, 1953, Plath overdosed on pills in the cellar of her mother's home.

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|During the {{negotiations}} to create OSAS, the airlines quickly {{agreed that they}} would need a common profile and naming style. Referencing Vikings allowed the airline to play on a common history between the Scandinavian countries, while giving a global distinctive and recognizable mark. The aircraft were painted with a livery consisting of a dragon's head, iconic of the Viking longships, in combination with a cheatline which intersected with the windows such as to visualize the shields hung on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longships.|$|E
5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull. Shōhō was also initially equipped with four twin 25mm Type 96 light AA guns, also in sponsons along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull.|$|R
50|$|In {{this case}} <b>the</b> {{vertices}} <b>of</b> A1 are <b>the</b> free apices <b>of</b> isosceles triangles with apex angles π/2 erected over <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadrilaetral A0. <b>The</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadrilateral A2 are <b>the</b> midpoints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadrilateral A1.

5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking.

5|$|Excavations {{have shown}} {{evidence}} of a 12th-century masonry building {{on the top of}} the hill, which may be from the probable adulterine castle. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound may have been terraced for agricultural use due to much of the surrounding land flooded on a regular basis during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous {{attack from the}} castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, {{but many of the}} peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
