40|$|Tea is {{a popular}} {{beverage}} with health benefits. The enriched tea polyphenols including catechins {{have been reported to}} perform anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity. In this study, we compared the levels of catechins and caffeine in <b>tea</b> <b>flowers</b> from six different species of Camellia japonica, Camellia tenuifolia. Camellia oleifera, 2 savoury Camellias and Camellia sinensis. C sinensis detected a variety of catechins, while only (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin can be detected by the iso-cratic HPLC system in other <b>tea</b> <b>flowers.</b> The total catechin content was also lower in these <b>tea</b> <b>flowers.</b> In addition, the water extract of <b>tea</b> <b>flowers</b> was used to test the biological functions including anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. The water extract of C sinensis remained most active among six different species using both MTT assays and the cleavage analysis of apoptosis-related molecules, PARP and Bid. The major bioactivity of C. sinensis comes from (-) -epigallo-catechin- 3 -gallate and (-) -epigallocatechin, not detected in other five species. Interestingly, we found that C. tenuifolia still had potent bioactivity. It is likely that bioactive molecules other than catechins exist in C tenuifolia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Miniature roses are {{represented}} by twiggy, repeat-flowering shrubs ranging from 6" [...] to 36" [...] in height, with most falling in the 12"-24" [...] height range. Blooms come in all the hybrid tea colours; many varieties also emulate the classic high centred hybrid <b>tea</b> <b>flower</b> shape. Miniature roses are often marketed and sold by the floral industry as houseplants, {{but it is important}} to remember that these plants are largely descended from outdoor shrubs native to temperate regions; thus, most miniature rose varieties require an annual period of cold dormancy to survive. (Examples: 'Petite de Hollande' (Miniature Centifolia, once-blooming), 'Cupcake' (Modern Miniature, repeat-blooming). Miniature garden roses only grow in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== The {{history of}} chabana follows hand-in-hand {{with the history}} of chadō, and within that {{historical}} milieu, chabana emerged in tandem with the rise of wabi-cha around the Momoyama period. Sen Rikyū is considered the most influential person in the development of wabi-cha, and is also credited as the originator of the accompanying nageire mode of flower arrangement, which is characterized by freedom and spontaneity in expressing the natural beauty of the material. Among the statements attributed to him, the first one in the set of seven known as [...] "Rikyū's Seven Precepts" [...] (Rikyū shichisoku) concerns chabana. [...] It goes, [...] "The flowers Chabana should be such as they are in the moor." [...] In the history of ikebana, the nageire style was added to the more stylized rikka arrangement around the end of the 1600s, as influenced by chabana. This new style had fewer rules and appealed to those who were searching for a more simple and natural look. Early tea masters used the nageire style until it further divided into the seika, pure chabana, <b>tea</b> <b>flower,</b> styles. The chabana style, with no formal written rules, became the standard style of arrangement for Chanoyu.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Tea-scented Chinas (Rosa × odorata) were Oriental cultivars {{thought to}} represent hybrids of R. chinensis with R. gigantea, a large Asian climbing rose with pale-yellow blossoms. Immediately upon their introduction {{in the early}} 19th-century breeders went to work with them, especially in France, crossing them first with China roses and then with Bourbons and Noisettes. The Tea roses are repeat-flowering roses, named for their fragrance being reminiscent of Chinese black tea (although {{this is not always}} the case). The colour range includes pastel shades of white, pink and (a novelty at the time) yellow to apricot. The individual flowers of many cultivars are semi-pendent and nodding, due to weak flower stalks. In a [...] "typical" [...] Tea, pointed buds produce high-centred blooms which unfurl in a spiral fashion, and the petals tend to roll back at the edges, producing a petal with a pointed tip; the Teas are thus the originators of today's [...] "classic" [...] florists' rose form. According to rose historian Brent Dickerson, the Tea classification owes as much to marketing as to botany; 19th-century nurserymen would label their Asian-based cultivars as [...] "Teas" [...] if they possessed the desirable <b>Tea</b> <b>flower</b> form, and [...] "Chinas" [...] if they did not. Like the Chinas, the Teas are not hardy in colder climates. Examples: 'Lady Hillingdon', 'Maman Cochet', 'Duchesse de Brabant', 'Mrs. Foley Hobbs'.|$|E

40|$|Major {{chemical}} compounds in different extracts from tea flowers (Camellia sinensis) were analyzed. Distilled water or 70 % ethanol extracts were then fractionated with chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, respectively. Each extract fraction was tested its scavenging activities on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl free radicals. The {{results showed that}} ethyl acetate fraction of ethanol-extract of <b>tea</b> <b>flower</b> (EEA) exhibited the highest quenching activity to hydroxyl radicals (SC 50 11. 6 µg/ml), followed by ethanol-extract (EE) of <b>tea</b> <b>flower</b> (SC 50 19. 7 µg/ml). Same <b>tea</b> <b>flower</b> extract showed big different scavenging activities on different free radicals. EEA quenched 80 % of hydroxyl radicals generated by Fenton’s reaction, however, only 40 % of DPPH radical was scavenged in the Fe (II) -H 2 O 2 -luminol system. The contents of flavones, polyphenols and catechins in EE and EEA fractions were higher than those in other fractions. We suggest that the stronger scavenging abilities to free radicals {{might be due to}} polyphenols, EGCG, ECG and flavones.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{with the aim of}} {{evaluating}} the effect of ecologically sound approaches for nematode management on non-target organisms, free-living nematodes. The materials tested were sugarcane bagasse, molasses, <b>tea</b> and <b>flower</b> composts, neem (Achook), a biological agent (Paecilomyces lilacinus) and fenamiphos (Nemacur). The treatments were administered before planting carnation var. White Natila in flower beds that were naturally infested with nematodes. Application of bagasse, molasses, <b>tea</b> and <b>flower</b> composts resulted in increased abundance of free-living nematodes compared to the control where nothing was applied. Bacterial feeders, fungal feeders, and predators comprised 73, 14 and 13 %, respectively of the free-living nematodes recovered. Members of the genus Rhabditis were the most abundant (10 %) among the bacteriovores while Mononchus (10 %) and Aphelenchoides (14 %) dominated among the predators and fungivorous trophic groups, respectively. The highest numbers of free-living nematodes were recorded at 90 Days after Planting (DAP) in plots treated with bagasse and molasses but the numbers declined at 180 DAP. A steady increase in numbers of free-living nematodes was observed in plots treated with <b>tea</b> and <b>flower</b> composts up to 180 DAP. Significant reductions in abundance of free-living nematodes were recorded in plots treated with fenamiphos and neem. This study has established that application of organic substrates serve as a stimulus to processes leading to build-up of free-living nematodes. The organic substrates can strongly be recommended for use in sustainable carnation production systems...|$|R
