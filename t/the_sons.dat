5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs.

Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E
