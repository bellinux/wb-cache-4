Seal body condition, {{as a proxy for}} foraging success, was estimated through changes in drift rate from <b>Time</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Recorder</b> (TDR) data. We identified (1) statistically distinct behavioural modes from the tracking data (intensive vs. extensive foraging modes) and (2) distinct dive classes from the TDR diving data (drift, exploratory, shallow active and deep active dives). Active dives, associated with vertical foraging and chasing, were more numerous when the seals were in intensive foraging mode. Improved body condition and mass gain of seals were also associated with the intensive foraging mode and, within the vertical dimension, with sets of highly active dives. In conclusion, proportions of dive classes varied according to seals' horizontal behaviour. Intensive foraging detected from surface tracking data is a good predictor of diving activity and foraging success occurring in the vertical dimension...|$|E

However, {{there is a need}} to investigate other possible impacts of instruments on animals. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of deploying instruments on the surface temperature distribution of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Infrared (IR) thermography was used to record the surface temperature of two juveniles that had been fitted with heart rate recorders and mounting straps for the attachment of a <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorder.</b> When animals were fully wet and inactive, the surface temperature pattern was unaffected by instruments. However, as animals dried out regions of high temperature were recorded around the edges of attachment sites compared to surrounding fur. This appeared to be due to heat leakage around the sides of instruments and mounting straps that provided an additional layer of insulation. There were no obvious changes in the surface temperature distribution around instruments associated with duration of deployment. This work shows that attachment of relatively small biologging instruments will produce localised effects on heat transfer in air but will not significantly change the total heat exchange of grey seals on land or at sea. IR thermography was also shown to be a useful method of detecting surface temperature patterns associated with epidural anaesthesia and blubber biopsy...|$|E

These data have been used {{in a wide variety of}} ways, from characterizing the reproductive and foraging ecology of these species to inferring ecosystem changes based on variation in attendance patterns. Yet the accuracy of VHF data has never been appropriately evaluated. Our study compares VHF data collected on 16 lactating Antarctic fur seals to assess onshore attendance with concurrently collected <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorder</b> (TDR) data used as the ‘true’ measurement of time spent onshore. Within the retrieved datasets, 25 % of the VHF data could not be interpreted with any reliability. Additionally, there were significant differences in the number and duration of attendance bouts between the 2 instrument types, with VHF data overestimating attendance bout duration by approximately 8. 9 h on average. Importantly, the magnitude and direction of errors between VHF and TDR measurements were not systematic, suggesting that VHF data is an inappropriate method for collecting attendance data. Modelling the raw VHF data in a state-space framework elicited mean attendance durations that were indistinguishable from TDR-derived measurements, suggesting this approach may provide a means to re-examine historic VHF data. Moreover, given the evolution of electronic tags in terms of sophistication, miniaturization, longevity and decreasing cost over the last 30 yr, TDRs are a more appropriate means of collecting attendance data on centrally foraging marine mammals such as otariids.

40|$|International audienceIdentifying animals' {{successful}} foraging {{areas is}} a major challenge, but such comprehensive knowledge is needed for the management and conservation of wild populations. In recent decades, numerous specific analytic methods {{have been developed to}} handle tracking data and to identify preferred foraging areas. In this study, we assessed the efficiency of different track-based methods on Argos and GPS predators' tracks. We investigated (1) the consistency in the detection of foraging areas between track-based methods applied to 2 tracking data resolutions and (2) the similarity of foraging behaviour identification between track-based methods and an independent index of foraging success. We focused on methods that are commonly used in the literature: empirical descriptors of foraging effort, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and first passage time analysis. We applied these methods to satellite tracking data collected on 6 long-ranging elephant seals equipped with both Argos and GPS tags. Seals were also equipped with <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorder</b> loggers from which we estimated an independent index, based on the drift rate and the changes in the seals' body condition, as a proxy for foraging success along the tracks. Favourable foraging zones identified by track-based methods were compared to locations where the body condition of the seals significantly increased. With or without an environmental covariate, HMMs were the most reliable for identifying successful foraging areas on both high (GPS) and low (Argos) resolution data.

Dives to the seabed accounted for 59 % (171 h) and 75 % (215 h) of the internesting interval, respectively, with most dives being shallow (< 20 m), suggesting the turtles remained close to the shore. These benthic dives decreased markedly in the days following or prior to a nesting event, suggesting that the behaviours associated with nesting may be protracted. This importance of the seabed for loggerhead turtles in Cyprus contrasts with the far more extensive use of mid-water resting dives recently reported for this species in Japan.

We have applied this method to sperm whales off Japan. Sperm whales are thought to have a greatest diving ability among cetaceans but almost nothing is known about their diving behavior. We successfully deployed suction cup attached TDR tags to six whales off the Kumano Coast and the Ogasawara Islands without any intense reactions of the whales.

40|$|Abstract: Bio-logging {{devices have}} become an {{integral}} part of many studies on the behav-ior, physiology and ecology of marine vertebrates. In the beginning, 1963, a <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorder</b> (TDR) was designed to measure time and depth of freely diving Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, in the Antarctic. This was the first device used to obtain detailed information on underwater activity of an aquatic animal. It recorded data for one hour. Since that time there has been a steady evolution of this type of recorder. In 1975 a revised TDR with an extended time base of 14 days recorded the diving activity of the northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus. Through the rest of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s other fur seal species, as well as Weddell seals, and leather back sea turtles were studied, and the inventive pace of the TDR quickened. In 1981 an elegant mechanical recorder that lasted for three months was deployed. The emergence of microprocessors in the 1980 ’s made possible further miniatur-ization and the logging of several additional variables. The next revolution occurred in the 1990 ’s with the inception of satellite transmitters that made it possible to determine precise-ly where an animal was on the planet, and to retrieve other data as well. This remarkable abil-ity to incorporate the measurement of spatial distribution was soon augmented by a third rev-olution, the use of mountable videocameras or camcorders on the animals themselves. With this arsenal of bio-logging devices many questions about aquatic animals are being resolved that were only dreams for the first generation of biologists studying the marine activities of vertebrates. key words: archival recorder, bio-logger, camcorder, TDR, PT...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStudies on diving {{behaviour}} classically divide a {{dive into}} three phases: the descent, bottom and ascent phases, with foraging assumed to occur during the bottom phase. The greater complexity of dive revealed through modern, high resolution data highlights {{the need to}} re-assess this approach and to consider {{a larger number of}} phases within individual dives. Two southern elephant seals (SES) were fitted with a head mounted <b>Time</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Recorder</b> (TDR) and an accelerometer from which prey capture attempts were estimated. A Weddell seal was also fitted with a TDR. TDRs for both species recorded depth once per second. We quantified the within dive behaviour using an automated broken stick algorithm identifying the optimal number of segments within each dive. The vertical sinuosity of the segments was used to infer two types of behaviours, with highly sinuous segments indicating "hunting" and less sinuous segments indicating "transiting". Using the broken stick method the seals alternated between "hunting" and "transit" modes with an average of 6 ± 2 and 7 ± 0. 02 behavioural phases within each dive for the Weddell seal and SES, respectively. In SES, 77 % of prey capture attempts (identified from the acceleration data) occurred in highly sinuous phases ("hunting") as defined by our new approach. SES spent more time in transit mode within a dive, and hunting mostly occurred during the bottom phase. Conversely the Weddell seal spent more time in hunting mode which also occurred during bottom phase but occurred mostly at shallower depths. Such differences probably reflect different foraging tactics and habitat use. For both species, hunting time differs significantly from bottom time previously used as a proxy for the time spent foraging in a dive. The hunting time defined by our method therefore provides a more accurate fine-scale description of the seals' foraging behaviour...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackgroundIn {{the last}} decade, {{thousands}} of satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) have been deployed, providing large datasets on marine predator movement patterns at sea and their diving behaviour. However, {{the latter is}} in a highly summarised, low-resolution form, from which {{it is difficult to}} make the sorts of important behavioural inferences that are possible from higher-resolution datasets (such as detection of likely foraging events). The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simple, but accurate tool to detect and quantify within-dive foraging periods in low-resolution dives. MethodTwo southern elephant seals were fitted with a head-mounted <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorder</b> (TDR) (recording depth at 1 Hz) and an accelerometer (recording 3 axes of acceleration at 16 Hz) from which prey capture attempts were estimated (PrCA), and a Weddell seal was also fitted with a TDR (1 Hz). The resulting high-resolution dive profiles were used to: (1) calculate an accurate index of foraging effort based on the detection of vertical sinuosity switches (i. e. hunting highres time); (2) produce an SRDL-equivalent low-resolution dataset using a broken stick algorithm; and (3) from each low-resolution dive calculate a set of candidate foraging effort indices. ResultsHunting lowres time, which is the total time spent in decreased vertical velocity segments of the dive, was the foraging effort index that best correlated with hunting highres time. Hunting highres mode of SES dives (highly sinuous parts of high-resolution dives) was associated with 77 % of total PrCA. In comparison, Hunting lowres segments of SES dives were associated with 68 % of PrCA as well as with four times more PrCA than transit lowres segments. ConclusionWe found a low-resolution index which indicates foraging activity within a highly summarised dive profile and which identified most PrCA, despite degraded information transmitted by SLDRs. Used in combination with other measurements of the in situ environment, the hunting lowres index could be used in numerous integrated marine ecology studies, such as habitat use studies that are crucial to facilitate more effective conservation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe compared, for {{the first}} time the {{foraging}} ecology of both sexes of the blue-eyed Crozet shag (Phalacrocorax melanogenis), using ventrally attached <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> to investigate differences in time-budget and diving behaviour between the sexes during the chick-rearing. Males were the only ones to dive over 55 m. Females dived mostly between 15 and 35 m, a zone poorly used by males. Females foraged mostly in the morning and males in the afternoon. Females also spent one hour longer diving per day compared to males. There were differences in diving strategies and diet, indicating that both sexes targeted essentially the same prey, but of different sizes, males specializing in bigger fish. Although the relationship between sexual dimorphism and diving depth was positive (larger animals diving deeper), evidence suggests that body size (in terms of oxygen storage capacity) is not sufficient to explain so many differences in foraging ecology. Instead, we propose prey size (possibly driven by a limitation of prey handling ability in relation to beak size) could be an essential factor in shaping the male/female behavioural segregation in the Crozet shag; future studies should concentrate on this particular aspect...|$|R
40|$|New {{advantages}} {{in science and}} technology, such as <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> (TDRs), have allowed researchers to study the dive behavior of sea turtles in their natural habitats. Observing dive behavior of internesting turtles has provided significant evidence on how to protect nesting turtles from human interactions. One source of anthropogenic mortality on marine turtles is boat strikes. Trend data from the Florida Sea Turtle Stranding Network demonstrate that the annual proportions of boat-strike related mortality is increasing. Since 1980 boat strike injuries have tripled in Florida. This study, near Casey Key Beach in southwest Florida, examined the internesting dive behavior of loggerhead sea turtles using time-depth-recorders; National Geographic Crittercamstm, and satellite-linked location data to evaluate the risk of boat impacts based on the resulting dive data. When combined with 4 years of satellite telemetry data gathered prior to this study I revealed that loggerhead turtles are most vulnerable to boat strikes between 8 a. m. – 12 p. m. on the day following a nesting or false crawl event and {{on the night before}} returning to the beach to nest.

40|$|Marine predators {{are thought}} to utilise oceanic {{features}} adjusting their foraging strategy in a scale-dependent manner. Thus, they {{are thought to}} dynamically alter their foraging behaviour in response to environmental conditions encountered. In this study, we examined the foraging behaviour of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at South Georgia in relation to predictable and stable oceanographic features. We studied penguins during their long post-laying foraging trips during December 2005 and January 2006. For this investigation, we undertook a simultaneous analysis of ARGOS satellite-tracking data and Mk 7 Wild Life Computers <b>Time</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Recorder</b> (TDR) dive data. To investigate correlations between foraging behaviour and oceanographic conditions, we used SST data from January 2006 from MODIS satellite AQUA. To determine changes in search effort, first passage time (FPT) was calculated; for analysis of dive behaviour, we used several dive parameters that {{are thought to be}} reliable indicators of changes in foraging behaviour. King Penguins appeared to target predictable mesoscale features in the Polar Front Zone (PFZ), either a warm-core eddy in the PFZ or regions of strong temperature gradients at oceanic fronts. Two different trip types could be distinguished: direct trips with a straight path to one foraging area at the edge of an eddy or at a thermal front, and circular trips where birds foraged along strong thermal gradients at the northern limit of the PFZ. It is likely that both trip types were a direct consequence of prey encounter rates and distributions, both of which are likely to be associated with these oceanographic features. Circular trips often included passages across the centre of an eddy where birds made deep foraging dives, but remained only a short time in the eddy, possibly because prey were too deep. All birds showed Area Restricted Search (ARS) at scales of < 10 km. The two trip types had different ARS patterns, with clear ARS hotspots for direct trips and several ARS hotspots over the whole duration of the trip for circular trips. Dive behaviour had clear relationships with the changing water temperature and the time of day, presumably in response to different prey distribution. Especially for direct trips, dive behaviour showed significant differences within and outside of ARS hotspots. Thus, King Penguins appear to target predictable mesoscale features in the PFZ. They use ARS in different patterns to exploit the environment and adjust their foraging strategy and diving behaviour depending upon conditions they encountered. Diving behaviour showed correlations to ARS patterns, especially for direct trips, which may represent a favourable foraging strategy. The presence of predictable oceanic features allows King Penguins to focus their foraging effort, presumably allowing them to increase their foraging success and decrease their diving effort.

40|$|The {{principle}} of competitive exclusion postulates that ecologically-similar species {{are expected to}} partition their use of resources, leading to niche divergence.

Here, by combining information obtained from tracking devices (geolocator-immersion and <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders),</b> stable isotope analyses of blood, and conventional morphometry, we provide a detailed investigation of the ecological mechanisms that explain the coexistence of four species of abundant, zooplanktivorous seabirds in Southern Ocean ecosystems (blue petrel Halobaena caerulea, Antarctic prion Pachyptila desolata, common diving petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix and South Georgian diving petrel P. georgicus). The results revealed a combination of horizontal, vertical and temporal foraging segregation during the breeding season. The stable isotope and morphological analyses reinforced this conclusion, indicating that each species occupied a distinct trophic space, and that this appears to reflect adaptations in terms of flight performance. In conclusion, the present study indicated that although there was a degree of overlap in some measures of foraging behaviour, overall the four taxa operated in very different ecological space despite breeding in close proximity.

However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour {{in a wide range of}} animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{targeting}} in longline fisheries have major impacts on CPUE (catch per unit effort). To target large pelagic fishes in longline fisheries, fishermen deployed several tactics {{according to the}} target species. For a given species, the tactic depends on both the season and the fishing ground. One of major aims of the fishing tactic is to set the longline for optimizing the overlap between the distribution of hook depths and the supposed preferential vertical habitat of the target species. Thus, the maximum fishing depth (MFD) of the longline is recognized as a key parameter for estimating the distribution of hook depths and then to standardize fishing effort. In this context, the number of hooks per basket (HPB) is commonly used as a proxy indicator of MFD (this information has been collected for the Japanese longline fishery since 1975). Unfortunately HPB {{is not a good}} proxy indicator of MFD. In {{the first part of this}} work we illustrate why our previous affirmation is consistent from a theoretical point of view.

40|$|The diving {{behaviour}} of 14 adult southern elephant seals {{was investigated}} using <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders.</b> Each of the seals performed some dives that were longer than its theoretical aerobic dive limit. Forty-four {{percent of all}} dives made by post-moult females exceeded the calculated limit compared with 7 % of those made by postbreeding females and less than 1 % of those made by adult males. The extended dives displayed characteristics that suggested that they were predominantly foraging dives, although some were apparently rest dives. Dives longer than the calculated aerobic limits often occurred in bouts; the longest consisted of 63 consecutive dives and lasted 2 days. Postmoult females performed longer bouts of extended dives than postbreeding females. Extended surface periods (longer than 30  min) were {{not related to the}} occurrence of extended dives or bouts of extended dives. The possible physiological mechanisms that permit such prolonged continuous dives are discussed. Southern elephant seals may increase the aerobic capacity of dives by lowering their metabolism to approximately 40 % of the resting metabolic rate on long dives. There is substantial interseal variability in the methods used to cope with long dives. Some animals appear to use physiological strategies that allow them to prolong the time available to them {{at the bottom of a}} dive, while others use alternative strategies that may limit the time available at the bottom of their dives...|$|R

We investigated the effect of SST and behaviour on the physiological stress response to capture of the gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, and compared our results to a laboratory study using similar conditions to test whether stress responses of in situ capture {{are consistent with those}} from laboratory simulations. Capture time for 23 M. antarcticus ranged 32 - 241 min as measured by hook timers or <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> (TDR) in SSTs ranging 12 - 20 °C. TDR data from 13 M. antarcticus were analysed to quantify capture behaviour as the percentage of time spent moving during capture. Several physiological variables measured from blood samples obtained immediately upon the animals' landing indicated that although warmer SSTs increased metabolic rate, the stress response to capture was not exacerbated by capture duration. During capture movement occurred for an average of 10 % of the time and since M. antarcticus can respire whilst stationary, restricted movement probably mitigated potential influences of increased SSTs and capture duration on the stress response. Previous laboratory findings were also shown to be indicative of in situ conditions and we thus advise that studies control for water temperature given the influence it has on variables (e. g. lactate) used to measure capture stress in elasmobranchs.

40|$|The use of biologging {{instruments}} {{has greatly}} improved {{our understanding of}} the behaviour, physiology and ecology of free-ranging marine mammals. However, handling wild animals and attaching instruments to streamlined bodies can cause stress and potentially influence behaviour and swimming/ diving energetics. The goals of this study, undertaken on Bouvetøya, were (1) to determine if the first trip to sea after instrumentation is representative of subsequent trips in lactating Antarctic fur seals, to explore potential handling effects and assess possible biases in having multiple short-duration deployments (inflating N, using a limited number of tags) and (2) to evaluate potential effects of two different instrument combinations (SMRU satellite data relay loggers and very high frequency radio transmitters versus Wildlife Computers <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> and very high frequency radio transmitters) on trip durations, dive parameters, female body condition and pup growth. Handling did not appear to have any effects on the parameters studied; data from the first and second trips did not differ significantly. This implies that multiple short-term deployments are unlikely to result in biased data in this species. Instrument type did have measurable effects; time-at-sea was greater and pup growth was lower for pairs in which mothers carried bulkier instruments. This suggests that instrument streamlining is important to avoid negative impacts and that bulkier equipment should be deployed on lactating females with caution and only for short periods. The study highlights that instrument effects should be taken into account when comparing data from experiments collected using different equipment packages. Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition.

While other colonies have been extensively studied, this remote and second largest global population remains relatively unknown. <b>Time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> and satellite relay data loggers were deployed on breeding females during the 2000 – 2001 and 2001 – 2002 summers. Attendance and foraging patterns {{were similar to}} those observed at colonies in the Scotia Sea region where Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the predominant prey. Early to mid-lactation trips ranged within ~ 100 km of the island, usually towards the west; the dominant direction shifted later in the season and the range also increased markedly to a peak between early February and early March. Solar elevation influenced arrivals and departures from the island, with most departures occurring around sunset. Diurnal variations in diving behaviour were consistent with the vertical migration of krill. Diving frequency was higher at night and diving effort peaked around morning twilight. Afternoon deep diving was common, suggesting that females might target dense daytime krill aggregations between the photic zone and the thermocline. Trip durations increased throughout early to mid-lactation, peaking in late January to early March, before again decreasing towards the end of lactation. Our results illustrate the substantial variability, both between individuals and within individuals over time, that is likely to reflect variations in prey distribution and in the growth requirements of pups. Such variations need {{to be taken into account}} when estimating habitat use and resource utilisation in marine top predators. 2014 - 06 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{is an important}} structuring element in marine ecosystems, especially in the Southern Ocean which offers few prey choices to comparatively large predator populations. We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetøya—a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. <b>Time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007 / 2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for {{the west side of}} the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at ~ 70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetøya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.

The {{principle}} of competitive exclusion postulates that ecologically-similar species are expected to partition their use of resources, leading to niche divergence. The most likely mechanisms allowing such coexistence are considered to be segregation in a horizontal, vertical or temporal dimension, or, where these overlap, a difference in trophic niche. Here, by combining information obtained from tracking devices (geolocator-immersion and <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders),</b> stable isotope analyses of blood, and conventional morphometry, we provide a detailed investigation of the ecological mechanisms that explain the coexistence of four species of abundant, zooplanktivorous seabirds in Southern Ocean ecosystems (blue petrel Halobaena caerulea, Antarctic prion Pachyptila desolata, common diving petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix and South Georgian diving petrel P. georgicus). The results revealed a combination of horizontal, vertical and temporal foraging segregation during the breeding season. The stable isotope and morphological analyses reinforced this conclusion, indicating that each species occupied a distinct trophic space, and that this appears to reflect adaptations in terms of flight performance. In conclusion, the present study indicated that although there was a degree of overlap in some measures of foraging behaviour, overall the four taxa operated in very different ecological space despite breeding in close proximity. We therefore provide important insight into the mechanisms allowing these very large populations of ecologically-similar predators to coexist.

40|$|Contemporary {{studies of}} sea turtle diving {{behaviour}} are generally based upon sophisticated {{techniques such as}} the attachment of <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders.</b> However, if the risks of misinterpretation are to be minimized, {{it is essential that}} electronic data are analysed in the light of first-hand observations. To this aim, we set out to make observations of juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata, Linnaeus, 1766) foraging and resting in a shallow water coral reef habitat around the granitic Seychelles (4 ° 2 ̆ 7 S, 55 ° 2 ̆ 7 E). Data were collected from six study sites characterized by a shallow reef plateau (< 5 m) and a flat sandy area {{at the base of the}} reef face (< 10 m). Observation data were categorized into the following behaviours: (1) stationary foraging; (2) active foraging; (3) resting; and (4) assisted resting. Central to this investigation was the development of a technique for accurately estimating the size of sea turtles in situ based upon previously tested techniques for reef fishes. This revealed that through calibration, the curved carapace length (CCL) of marine turtles can be consistently estimated to within 10 cm of their actual size. Although rudimentary, this has advantages for assessing the residency or absence of specific life history stages from particular environments. Indeed, our data supported previous claims that following the reproductive season, adult hawksbills in the region may move away from the nesting beaches to alternative foraging grounds whilst immature turtles (following the pelagic juvenile stage) may opt to reside in areas close to their natal beaches. With regards to habitat utilization, juvenile hawksbills displayed an alternating pattern of short, shallow foraging dives followed by deeper, longer resting dives. These findings are consistent with previous electronic studies of free-range diving in this species and suggest that the maximization of resting duration may be an important factor driving this behaviour...|$|R
40|$|In seabirds a broad {{variety of}} morphologies, flight styles and feeding methods exist as an {{adaptation}} to optimal foraging in contrasted marine environments {{for a wide}} variety of prey types. Because of the low productivity of tropical waters it is expected that specific flight and foraging techniques have been selected there, but very few data are available. By using five different types of high-precision miniaturized logger (global positioning systems, accelerometers, <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders,</b> activity recorders, altimeters) we studied the way a seabird is foraging over tropical waters. Red-footed boobies are foraging in the day, never foraging at night, probably as a result of predation risks. They make extensive use of wind conditions, flying preferentially with crosswinds at median speed of 38 km h− 1, reaching highest speeds with tail winds. They spent 66 % of the foraging trip in flight, using a flap–glide flight, and gliding 68 % of the flight. Travelling at low costs was regularly interrupted by extremely active foraging periods where birds are very frequently touching water for landing, plunge diving or surface diving (30 landings h− 1). Dives were shallow (maximum 2. 4 m) but frequent (4. 5 dives h− 1), most being plunge dives. While chasing for very mobile prey like flying fishes, boobies have adopted a very active and specific hunting behaviour, but the use of wind allows them to reduce travelling cost by their extensive use of gliding. During the foraging and travelling phases birds climb regularly to altitudes of 20 – 50 m to spot prey or congeners. During the final phase of the flight, they climb to high altitudes, up to 500 m, probably to avoid attacks by frigatebirds along the coasts. This study demonstrates the use by boobies of a series of very specific flight and activity patterns that have probably been selected as adaptations to the conditions of tropical waters...|$|R
40|$|The {{probability}} of detecting an animal in a sampled area during a survey consists of 2 components: 1) the {{probability of}} an animal being available for detection (availability), which can be highly variable in heterogeneous environments; and 2) {{the probability of}} an animal being detected, conditional on its being available for detection (perception). Many surveys only estimate the latter probability because modeling the availability process requires information collected external to the survey. We illustrate estimation of both probabilities in an application to aerial surveys of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in Northern Australian coastal waters where water clarity varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales. Using artificial dugong models and <b>timed</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> deployed on 15 wild dugongs to obtain dive profiles, we carried out experiments to determine zones of detectability for dugongs at the range of depths, turbidities, and sea states that spanned the environmental heterogeneity encountered on dugong surveys. Resulting probability estimates were heterogeneous and dependent on the measured conditions. To estimate perception probability, we used a tandem team of 2 observers {{on either side of}} the aircraft. This permitted fitting generalized Lincoln–Petersen models with Program MARK. We then used the generalized Horvitz–Thompson estimator, based on the overall detection probability for each individual dugong, to generate population estimates. We also developed a new simulation-based method for estimating standard errors and confidence intervals. We contrast absolute abundance estimates of dugongs in the Torres Strait and Northern Great Barrier Reef regions using both the new and original approaches (Marsh and Sinclair 1989 a). For Torres Strait, the new method produced a substantially smaller estimate (11, 956 vs. 14, 106 dugongs) and a very much smaller standard error (1, 189 vs. 2, 314 dugongs), whereas the new method produced slightly larger estimates (mean 9, 855 vs. 9, 193 dugongs, standard error 1, 184 vs. 917 dugongs) for the Northern Great Barrier Reef survey...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} process of {{adaptation to the}} aquatic environment has dramatically modified the anatomy and physiology of secondarily-aquatic, air-breathing seabirds and marine mammals to address oxygen constraints and unique sensorimotor conditions. As taxa that have arguably undergone significant evolutionary transformations, deep-diving sphenisciforms (penguins) and obligatorily aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) provide an excellent opportunity to study such physiological and anatomical adaptation. Investigation of heart rates of free-ranging emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) equipped with digital electrocardiogram <b>recorders</b> and <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> revealed a phenomenal dive capacity extending to 431 m as well as extreme bradycardia, reaching heart rates as low as 10 beats min- 1 during deep dives to promote oxygen conservation. The organization and potential function of the cetacean brain were examined with structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging of post-mortem killer whale (Orcinus orca) and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) brains. Structural images were acquired for an O. orca brain in situ and underwent manual segmentation to obtain volumetric measurements of neuroanatomy including gray and white matter, constituent neural regions (i. e., cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum), and subcortical and midbrain structures. This O. orca {{had one of the}} largest forebrains studied to date with cerebral volume comprising 81. 51 % of the total brain volume. Moreover, the cerebral white matter of O. orca and other delphinoids exhibited isometric scaling unlike other mammals suggesting that this divergent morphology may have evolved in response to the sensorimotor demands of the aquatic environment. Examination of T. truncatus cerebral white matter with diffusion tractography revealed widespread structural asymmetries potentially attributable to brain enlargement and isometrically-scaled white matter. Moreover, these structural asymmetries may underpin previously reported observations of functional and behavioral lateralization in cetaceans. These studies of cetacean anatomy and sphenisciform physiology provide insight into and promote our understanding of the evolution of arguably the most ocean-adapted seabirds and marine mammals...|$|R

This study investigated the relative influence of maternal traits, seasonal demands of pup-rearing, and individual effects on the foraging behavior of 27 female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica during 2 austral summers (2005 and 2006), using <b>time</b> <b>depth</b> <b>recorders.</b> The relationship between foraging and allocation was investigated using pup growth as an indicator of parental investment. While female diving behavior differed between years, trip duration was below the 10 yr mean and did not differ between the 2 years of the study, indicating favorable feeding conditions in both years. Study year and maternal age accounted for a significant amount of the variation in day and night dive characteristics, while maternal mass influenced only parameters related to night dive effort. As the season progressed, females increased their dive effort at night, made shorter daytime dives, with more bout diving. Individual variability accounted for a significant amount of the variation in all foraging parameters. Females could be assigned to one of 4 behavioral dive groups (high effort, low effort, intermediate effort with high dive rate, and intermediate effort), based on 13 dive parameters although year instrumented and age appeared to be important in determining group affiliation. Age, mass, year, and trip number influenced diving behavior; however, there was no relationship between foraging behavior and pup growth rate, except in young females.
