40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{material}} deprivation of the households {{with regard to the}} selected indicators, i. e. the costs that the household spends on housing, a region where the household is located, the number of the members and <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> in <b>the</b> household, age and sex of a head of the household, and economic activity and education level {{of the members of the}} household. The thesis aims not only to prove the dependence among the selected indicators but also to quantify this dependence by using the odds ratio. The individual effect of all variables was proven except of the one related to the number of <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> It was also demonstrated that the factors constituting a threat for the households by a material deprivation rate vary by the different age groups.

50|$|These amendments, however, {{avoided the}} {{question}} of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories. Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for <b>the</b> Aid to <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> and raised <b>the</b> maximum age of children eligible to receive money under <b>the</b> Aid to <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> to 18. <b>The</b> amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive old age pensions. These individuals had previously been granted lump-sum payments upon only death or coverage through <b>the</b> Aid to <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> program. If a married wage-earning woman’s own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband’s benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker. If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits. Since support for widows was <b>dependent</b> on <b>the</b> husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Identification of the {{contribution}} {{made by the}} divorced male and female parent to the direct consumption costs of <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> was <b>the</b> central purpose of the research study. Relationships between the parents' contributions to the consumption costs and specified demographic characteristics {{at the time of}} divorce, methods of determining support and property settlements received were investigated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Estimated Urban Family Budgets for the Seattle-Everett, Washington area and Revised Equivalence Scales served as the basis for determining the families' level of living and the consumptions costs of <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> A sample of 242 divorce cases involving minor children from Marion County, Oregon between 1 January 1975 and 31 December 1976 was randomly drawn from the Vital Statistics Section of the Oregon State Health Division in Portland, Oregon. In half of these cases the male parent's name was drawn; in the other half the female parent's name was drawn. A mailed questionnaire concerning the family's child support and economic situation was sent to the above sample. Fifteen responses from male parents and 30 responses from female parents were received and served as the data base for this research. Parents' mean age was somewhat over 30 years with both having some post high school education as the median educational level. The mean number of children per family was 2. 16. At the time of divorce the families' median income level was between 12, 000 and 13, 999 with 87 percent of the male parents and 51 percent of the female parents employed full time. Male parents generally experienced increases in their income following divorce while responding females reported decreases in income levels. Most male respondents estimated their share of property to be less than half while 50 percent of responding females estimated their share to be more than half. In 93 percent of the families, the female parent had custody of all <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> with <b>the</b> mean amount of child support awarded per <b>dependent</b> <b>child</b> being 102. 50 per month. In two cases the male parent had custody of all <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and in neither case was child support awarded. In one family each parent had custody of half the family's children with neither receiving child support. In approximately one-third of the families, the non-custodial parent was reported to be paying some expenses for <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> in addition to child support. The amount of child support awarded was reported to be determined by courts, mutual agreements of parents, lawyers and former spouses. Over half the parents responded that child support paid or received was adequate but in almost all cases no provision was made for increases in the amount of child support awarded. A difference was observed between the male and female parent's contribution to the consumption costs of <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> <b>The</b> parent's contribution to consumption costs was found to be <b>dependent</b> upon <b>the</b> educational level of the female parent, the employment status of the male parent, and the income level of the family. It was not found to be <b>dependent</b> on <b>the</b> number of <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> in <b>the</b> family, the age of parents, the educational level of the male parent, nor the employment status of the female parent. Data did suggest that a dependency relation might exist between the parent's contribution and the method of determining child support. No dependency was observed between the property settlement at time of divorce received and the parent's contribution to child support...|$|R
40|$|This article studies {{how social}} {{insurance}} programs shape individual 2 ̆ 019 s incentives {{to take up}} registered employment and to report earnings to the tax authorities. The analysis {{is based on a}} social insurance reform in Uruguay that extended healthcare coverage to <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> of registered private-sector workers. The identification strategy relies on a comparison between individuals with and without <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> before and after the reform. The reform increased benefit-eligible registered employment by 1. 6 percentage points (about 5 percent above the prereform level), mainly due to an increase in labor force participation rather than to movement from unregistered to registered employment. The shift was greater for parents with younger children and for cohabiting adults whose partners 2 ̆ 019 jobs did not provide the couples 2 ̆ 019 children with access to the benefit. Finally, the reform increased the incidence of underreporting of salaried earnings by about 4 percentage points (25 percent higher than the pre-reform level), mostly for workers employed at small firms. The increase in fiscal revenue from higher levels of registered employment was several orders of magnitude greater than the loss of revenue due to an increase in underreporting...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} of {{a federally funded}} demonstration child support-enforcement project. The basic research question was whether a multifaceted program of judicial and public awareness efforts and operational procedures administered to the Massachusetts District Courts was effective in establishing and advocating the use of wage-assignment legislation as an effective collection technique in child support cases. A pre- and posttreatment time-series design compared District Courts to relevant compari-son groups {{on a number of}} <b>dependent</b> measures. <b>The</b> results of the evaluation study suggest that making clerical-level staff available to approximately one-fourth of the Massachusetts District Courts significantly stabilized total child support collections for AFDC families. It was estimated that the additional child support payments collected in Massachusetts {{as a result of the}} treatment program administered to the District Courts represents almost 2 % of the total annual child support collections for AFDCfamilies in Massachusetts. Applying this net percentage gain to forecasted total child support collections for AFDC families in FY 82 resulted in a forecasted net additional collections of slightly more than $ 11 million for the next fiscal year, 1982. The widespread lack of financial support of low-income children 1 by parents living apart from the family unit (absent parents) prompted Congress to create Title IV-D of the Social Security Act in 1974. Title IV-D underscored <b>the</b> right of <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> to <b>the</b> financial support of their parents.
