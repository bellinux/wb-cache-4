5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|In December, Kelly {{started a}} storyline with Drew McIntyre, who had {{developed}} an on-screen romantic interest in her. She rebuffed his advances on several occasions, stating {{that he was}} <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> and vindictive. On January 30, 2011, at the Royal Rumble, Kelly prevented the Acting General Manager Vickie Guerrero from interfering in the World Heavyweight Championship match between Edge and Dolph Ziggler. On the following SmackDown, Kelly and Edge defeated LayCool and Ziggler in a two-on-three handicap match to retain Edge's World Heavyweight Championship, with Kelly scoring the pinfall. Following the match, Guerrero fired Kelly in storyline. At Elimination Chamber later that month, Kelly was re-hired by SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long, and made her return by attacking Guerrero. She was stopped by LayCool, who were in turn stopped by Trish Stratus. On the following episode of SmackDown, Kelly gained revenge on Guerrero when Kelly and Edge defeated Guerrero and Drew McIntyre in a mixed tag team match, causing Guerrero to be fired in storyline per the pre-match stipulation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} causes of shin-bang. Most notable causes include: ski boots {{that are too}} big, skiing in a [...] "back seat" [...] posture, ski boots that are <b>too</b> stiff, <b>aggressive</b> skiing, and landing jumps or drops in a back seat fashion.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{establishment}} of the Russian SFSR, Vladimir Lenin and his colleagues had considered the inclusion of a sword symbol in addition to the hammer and sickle as part of the state seal on which the flag was eventually based. The idea was dismissed as <b>too</b> visually <b>aggressive.</b> Lenin apparently said [...] "A sword is not our symbol." ...|$|R
5000|$|A week {{prior to}} the draft, an Associated Press sportswriter critiqued Bennett's playing {{abilities}} as: [...] "Played basketball for the Aggies as well, and has the athletic ability {{to be a nice}} red-zone target. Lack of speed means heâ€™s not a deep threat, but once he improves his routes, his strength and size should make him an asset. Needs to improve zone recognition, <b>too.</b> Good, <b>aggressive</b> blocker." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E
5|$|Bird set fast laps while leading {{and kept}} the lead after his pit stop {{at the end of}} the 16th lap ahead of the yet-to-stop Binder, Ceccon and Evans. Bird was pushing when he slid after {{clipping}} the kerb on the track and glanced the barrier leaving Portier turn on lap 18. Abt was attacking Haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to the outside of Haryanto by braking later than he did. The resulting manoeuvre meant Abt punted Haryanto into the inside barrier with his car's front nose being broken as a consequence. The need for the safety car was avoided as Haryanto's car was extracted from the track quickly. Abt was adjudged to have been <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards Haryanto by the stewards and was handed a drive-through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car. Dillmann attempted to pass Rosenzweig but ran deep at the Novelle Chicane. He was required to hand the position back to Rosenzweig. Binder made his pit stop on the 29th lap and emerged in seventh place behind Coletti. Bird continued to lead with a seventeen-second advantage over Ceccon who was fending off the faster Evans in third position who himself had Nasr and Calado close behind him.|$|E

50|$|Acanthus montanus, {{also known}} as Bear's Breech or Mountain Thistle, is a thinly {{branched}} perennial with basal clusters of oblong to lance-shaped glossy, dark green leaves reaching up to 12 in long. The leaves have silver marks and wavy margins. It reaches up to 6 ft tall and about 24 in wide. Spikes of pale pink flowers appear summer to fall. It prefers shady situations and occasional deep watering, but tolerates sunny, dry situations <b>too.</b> Its <b>aggressive</b> roots make this plant perfect for slopes.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{features}} LL Cool J vacillating {{about moving}} to California, rapping in the chorus, [...] "I'm {{going back to}} Cali", followed by [...] "I don't think so". In the verses, he describes a trip to Los Angeles in which he meets several women but is scared off because they are <b>too</b> sexually <b>aggressive.</b> The basic concept for the song was Rubin's, based on his own ambivalence about possibly moving from New York City to Los Angeles. (Rubin moved to LA later in 1988.) ...|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} critics have {{charged that the}} non-government owned banks are <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> in their loan {{recovery}} efforts in connexion with housing, vehicle and personal loans. There are press reports that the banks' loan recovery efforts have driven defaulting borrowers to suicide.|$|E
25|$|In his mid-20s, Dost Mohammad Khan {{was engaged}} to Mehraj Bibi, an {{attractive}} girl from a neighboring Orakzai clan. However, Mehraj was later betrothed to his cousin, because Khan's character was seen as <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> and rough. An angry Khan killed his cousin, leading to his ostracism from his family.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} terrarium contained turtles {{given to}} the museum when they have become <b>too</b> large and <b>aggressive</b> for home cultivation. Special displays explained the richness of life in coastal and around hydrothermal vents, and illustrated the relationships between humans and four types of shellfish (scallop, oyster, cowry, and the nautilus).|$|R
25|$|While {{retaining}} his WBC and WBA super flyweight belts, Darchinyan vacated his IBF belt {{in order}} to move up to bantamweight to fight IBF champion Joseph Agbeko in Sunrise, Florida on 11 July 2009. He lost a unanimous decision in a fight he looked almost <b>too</b> overly <b>aggressive</b> in and couldn't seem to cope with the Ghanan's style and repeatedly walked into straight right hands. Agbeko spoiled Darchinyan's goal of winning his third world title in a different division. Two judges scored the bout 114-113 for Agbeko, while the third had it for the Ghanaian Agbeko, 116-111. Despite the defeat at bantamweight, Darchinyan was still recognized as super flyweight champion by both the WBC and WBA.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{references}} to Wasp following her death. She is seen dining in Valhalla with other deceased superheroes when Thor gives a eulogy for Spider-Man (Peter Parker). A series of [...] "WASPS" [...] robots, designed by her late husband, also appear, and are eventually acquired by Mr. Morez (Modi). She is succeeded by the Red Wasp, who has powers which are similar <b>too,</b> yet more <b>aggressive</b> {{than those of}} the original Wasp.|$|R
25|$|Villa's tart poetic {{style was}} {{considered}} <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> at that time. In 1929 he published Man Songs, {{a series of}} erotic poems, which the administrators in UP found too bold and was even fined Philippine peso for obscenity by the Manila Court of First Instance. In that same year, Villa won Best Story of the Year from Philippine Free Press magazine for Mir-I-Nisa. He also received P1,000 prize money, which he used to migrate to the United States.|$|E
25|$|In Kaine's {{preparations}} for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, lawyer Robert Barnett {{played the role of}} Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence. (During Pence's own debate preparations, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker played the role of Kaine.) Pence was criticized after the debate for not defending Donald Trump's comments, while Kaine was criticized for being <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> and interrupting. According to ABC News, Kaine interrupted seventy times throughout the debate, while Pence interrupted forty times.|$|E
25|$|Given {{this sense}} of caution among {{key members of the}} British cabinet and of the army, it is even harder to {{understand}} why the British government went against the advice of its generals (such as Wolseley) to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. One strong argument is that Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war, and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.|$|E
50|$|The Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center {{was started}} by Lewis S. Robinson, and opened in 1993 with three bears as the Grizzly Discovery Center. It was {{intended}} as a sanctuary for bears that were removed from the wild because they had become <b>too</b> familiar or <b>aggressive</b> with people. In 1995, the G.D.C was sold to New York-based Ogden Entertainment. A wolf exhibit and ten captive-born wolves were added to the center in 1996.|$|R

5000|$|Three pigs {{were used}} in the filming of A Private Function, all named Betty. Producer Mark Shivas was advised by Intellectual Animals UK that the pigs used should be female and six months old so as to not be <b>too</b> large or <b>aggressive.</b> However, the pigs were [...] "unpredictable and often quite dangerous". During filming of one of the kitchen scenes, Maggie Smith was hemmed in by one of the pigs and needed to vault over the back of it in order to escape.|$|R
25|$|While {{some of his}} men thought Oates to be <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> for his {{own good}} and theirs, most admired his courage and affirmed that he was always to be found at the front of his men, in the thick of combat, and that he never asked them to go {{anywhere}} that he was not willing to go himself. A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
25|$|With the scored tied 3â€“3 in {{the second}} quarter, the Bears {{executed}} a halfback option play at the Redskins' 19-yard line, with running back Walter Payton throwing a 19-yard touchdown to Pat Dunsmore. Then on the second play in the third period, Bears wide receiver Willie Gault caught a short pass from quarterback Steve Fuller, evaded Redskins defensive back Darrell Green who was <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{in trying to make}} an interception, and turned upfield for a 75-yard touchdown. Redskins running back John Riggins capped off a 74-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run then cut the lead, 16â€“10. But a roughing the passer penalty call against Ken Coffey set up Dennis McKinnon's 16-yard reception to cap a Chicago 77-yard scoring drive to push their lead back to 13 at 23â€“10.|$|E
25|$|Cutoloâ€™s NCO {{became more}} {{powerful}} by encroaching and taking over other groupâ€™s territories. The NCO {{was able to}} break the circle of traditional power held by the families. Cutoloâ€™s organisation was just <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> and violent to be resisted by any individual families. Other Camorra families initially were too weakened, too divided, and simply too intimidated by the NCO. He requested that if other criminal groups wanted to keep their business, they had to pay the NCO protection on all their activities, including a percentage for each carton of cigarettes smuggled into Naples. This practice {{came to be known}} as ICA (Imposta Camorra Aggiunta â€“ or Camorristic Sale Tax), mimicking the state VAT sale tax IVA (Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto). For instance, Michele Zaza, the biggest Neapolitan cigarette smuggler, was reported to have paid the NCO more than 4 billion lire in the first three months after the imposition of the racket.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} the most {{innovative}} aspect of the bike. Suzuki abandoned steel altogether and built the frame from welded square section aluminium tubing. To gain the rigidity they wanted, the tubes were quite large, giving the bike a unique appearance. Whereas the Honda and Yamaha were fast street bikes that could be easily raced, the Suzuki was clearly a race bike that could be ridden on the street. The seating position was the racer's crouch, not the street rider's semi-upright one. It shipped stock with the motor tuned to deliver 100HP, but could be easily boosted to 135 with the race tuning kit. It was the lightest of the superbikes by a good margin, weighing only 388 lbs. Styling <b>too</b> was <b>aggressive</b> and unique, with a signature full fairing holding two round headlights, starting a trend that continues on supersport motorcycles to this day.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the {{influence}} of selected socio-demographic factors (gender, education, size and duration of action of the firm) on the differences in approach to selected constructs of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), concretely to innovativeness, proactivity and competitive aggressiveness. According to the various authors, EO represents a key element for the success of SMEs. Earlier studies identified the existence of the relationship between the characteristics of entrepreneurs and business performance of SMEs, but the results were still inconclusive. The paper reveals new aspects of dependences in relation to socio-demographic factors and contributes to the specification of the effects of mutual ties. The findings revealed that the researched entrepreneurs consider innovation policy and a proactive approach to be important but are not considered <b>too</b> competitively <b>aggressive.</b> There were found statistically significant differences in EO constructs, according to the socio-demographic factors...|$|R
50|$|Artificial life-forms {{composed}} of nanites, introduced in season 3 of Stargate Atlantis. They {{are similar to}} the human-form Replicators of Stargate SG-1 and so are called that in the show. The Asurans were created by the Ancients to combat the Wraith but were ultimately abandoned for being <b>too</b> dangerous. Extremely <b>aggressive,</b> the nanites thrived and built an advanced civilization. In season 4, Rodney McKay activates the Asurans' attack code, causing them to attack the Wraith, but this eventually comes to threaten all the inhabitants of Pegasus as the Asurans decide the best strategy is to starve the Wraith by eliminating all human life in the galaxy.|$|R

[...] Rather, they sought {{the return of the}} lighthouse and ship, seen in the distance on either side of Britannia on pre-1895 pennies, but with the sailing ship seen on Victorian pennies replaced with a modern warship. Officials felt this <b>too</b> <b>aggressive</b> at a delicate international time, and the ship was not restored, but the lighthouse was placed on Edward's patterns, and would be kept on the penny until its abolition after 1970.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little <b>too</b> <b>aggressive.</b> Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's gentle {{demeanor}} is also distinctive, {{in that he}} is fond {{of people}} and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, [...] "Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet. They're just sort of tough. If I brought Bayern out here, you can't get near him, he's <b>too</b> <b>aggressive.</b> 's just so different than any horse I've ever had." [...] He was not always so calm, described initially as [...] "a {{little bit of a}} headcase," [...] but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks, when [...] "all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow." ...|$|E

The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda <b>aggressive,</b> <b>too...</b> It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} a popular success in Switzerland, {{attracting}} more than four million viewers (about {{two thirds of the}} country's population). The project, led by Major General Gustav DÃ¤niker and by Rudolf Farner, a powerful advertising executive in civilian life, was however controversial because of its exorbitant CHF 1 million production cost, concerns about military secrecy and the use of foreign rather than Swiss creative staff. Critical opinion was mostly positive, although concerns were voiced about the film being <b>too</b> loud and <b>aggressive,</b> not highlighting the Swiss tradition of militia service, and for being too reminiscent of propaganda films by foreign totalitarian regimes. In a slightly adapted form, the film was also shown abroad under the English title Fortress of Peace.|$|R
