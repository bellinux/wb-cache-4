Njen toplotni odjem je priključen na obstoječi ogrevalni razvod interne toplotne postaje, ki je bila zgrajena leta 1975, in je še danes enake toplotne moči. Z leti pa se je povečevala potreba po toplotni moči, saj so se na toplotne razvode priključevala dodatna ogrevalna telesa, kot sta nova upravna stavba in rezervno ogrevanje strojnice bloka 6. V magistrski nalogi sem opisal obstoječe stanje interne toplotne postaje in informativno določil novo tehnološko opremo, ki bi jo bilo potrebno zamenjati pri rekonstrukciji interne toplotne postaje za nadaljnjo stabilno in varno obratovanje, ter določil nove režime regulacije obratovanja. Izdelal sem tudi izračun in izvedbo rezervnega ogrevanja strojnice bloka 6 in določil možne vire napajanja s paro za nadaljnjo obratovanje interne toplotne postaje. Določena tehnološka oprema je informativno izbrana kot primerzaradi poslovne narave so prikazani le osnovni podatki in stroškovne vrednosti izvedbe rekonstrukcije interne toplotne postaje. The {{building}} of the new thermo-electric power plant block 6 consequently required the need of a larger administrative infrastructure with a higher heating capacity.

40|$|In {{district}} <b>heating</b> <b>stations,</b> the <b>heat</b> carrier is circulated {{between the}} energy source and consumers by a pumping system. Fluid handling systems, such as pumping systems, {{are responsible for}} {{a significant portion of}} the total electrical energy use. Significant opportunities exist to reduce pumping energy through smart design, retrofitting, and operating practices. Most existing systems requiring flow control make use of bypass lines, throttling valves or pump speed adjustments. The most efficient of these options is pump speed control. One of the issues in using variable-speed pumping systems, however, is the total efficiency of the electric motor/pump arrangement under a given operating condition. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion about pump control in <b>heating</b> <b>stations</b> and analyzes the energy efficiency of flow control methods. Specific attention is also given to the selection of motor types, sizing and pump duty cycle. A comparative energy analysis is performed on the hot water discharge adjustment using throttling control valves and variable-speed drives in a district <b>heating</b> <b>station</b> constructed in Romania. To correlate the pumped flow rate with the heat demand and to ensure the necessary pressure using minimum energy, an automatic system has been designed. The performances of these control methods are evaluated in two practical applications. The results show that approximately 20 %– 50 % of total pumping energy could be saved by using the optimal control method with variable-speed pumps. Additionally, some modernization solutions to reduce the environmental impact of <b>heating</b> <b>stations</b> are described...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work {{was to develop a}} method for calculation of potential energy and cost saving by better utilization of available excess power and energy capacity in existing <b>heat</b> <b>stations.</b> Better utilization of available excess power and energy capacity is done by integrating existing <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> into one merged heating system. The results from the calculations can then be used in cost-benefit analysis to investigate the profitability of such measures. Basis for the study was a report about installed over capacity in a group of <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> in Narvik, Norway. This report concluded that it could be possible to integrate and coordinate nearby buildings into one larger system. It was assumed that by doing so the installed capacity could be utilized in a more efficient manner by operating a single boiler, or combination of boilers, with installed capacity matched to the current power demand. Such alteration between available boilers was assumed would give less intermittent boiler operations. A part of the work investigated the influence of heat loss in distribution systems on the overall boiler efficiency. The results showed that arranging distribution in such way that the heat loss can be utilized can have significantly impact on the resulting energy consumption. When calculating the need for purchased energy based on the net energy demand in the building, the calculation routine is conducted "backwards" compared to ordinary energy calculations. For such reversed calculations it is necessary to know the boilers efficiency. The efficiency can be determined by experience or rule of thumb, {{but it can also be}} calculated. These two methods are compared. The result demonstrated the importance of using calculated real efficiency when selecting boilers in an energy flexible heat system. The results from the work investigating energy and costs influence of oversized boilers were unambiguous. Compared to situations where the boilers were dimensioned according to prevailing design techniques, oversized boilers lead to more intermittent operation with decreased boiler efficiency as a result. From the study it is evident that correct dimensioning of boilers is of outmost importance when engineering new heat systems. For 50 % oversized system, the excess energy consumption was in the range of 5 - 30 % depending on control regime before integration. Resulting excess energy cost was between 5 % and 60 %. Multiple buildings with in-house <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> were modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The goal of the study was to investigate the hypothesis that integration of <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> would result in reduced energy consumption and cost. A boiler selection routine for multiple boiler operations was developed and implemented in the systems. Boiler configurations were selected based on lowest running cost for each hour. Based on the energy requirement in each building, the need for purchased energy was calculated. These systems were individually simulated under various climatic conditions for one consecutive year with regard to energy consumption and energy cost. Four versions, from 0 - 60 % oversized, of the <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> were simulated for each building. Later the in-house <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> were integrated into one larger energy flexible heat system, and the simulations were repeated. The results were then compared. The same mechanism as observed in previous work was observed. The integration led to more efficient operations with reduced energy consumption and cost as a result. Based on the work it should be clear that there is a potential for energy and cost savings by integration of multiple in-house <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> into one energy flexible heat system. Buildings and <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> come in numerous variations, configurations and under various climatic conditions. It has therefore not been possible to find general relationships that explain the savings. All situations/configurations must be evaluated separately. However, all case studies indicated that integration of <b>heat</b> <b>stations</b> is both feasible and profitable. Rate of savings depend to a large degree on how many buildings are being integrated and types of energy equipment installed. The results from the case studies with conventional boilers indicate an energy savings potential in the range of 5 - 13 %, and cost savings between 12 - 21 %.

40|$|Woody biomass {{in terms}} of short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) could be a promising alternative for producing biomass to generate renewable energy. Even through, from a single farms point of view, SRC {{seems to be an}} interesting land use alternative, farmers do not cultivate SRC. Some studies found out that the real options approach (ROA) could at least partially explain farmers' inertia of cultivating SRC. Nevertheless, those studies do not take into account market competition between farmers and farmers' fear of not having an outlet market in order to dispose the harvested wood chips. This inertia can also cause an investment reluctance concerning building biomass <b>heating</b> <b>stations.</b> In the present study therefore, we focuses on the whole value chain from producing wood chips over generating energy and selling the energy to the end-consumers. We develop an agent-based model which is able to consider market competition and can picture the whole value chain. In order to further motivate farmers to cultivate SRC different types of incentives offered by the biomass <b>heating</b> <b>station</b> are investigated. Our results show that if no incentive system is offered, farmers cultivate SRC reluctantly which leads to a loss of profit of the biomass <b>heating</b> <b>station.</b> With regard to an investment subsidy, it needs to be equal to approximately 300 % of the capital costs of investment to strongly motivate farmers to produce enough wood chips that largely decrease the loss of profit of the biomass <b>heating</b> <b>station.</b> If a price floor is offered, farmers' additional amount of wood chips produced is very small. Therefore, the loss of profit does not significantly decrease if the price floor amounts to 95 %...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how seasonal variations affect the quality of logging residues. The study was hosted by VIDA Energy. Logging residues can be processed and transported within different systems. Today the dominant systems are chipping at landing and bulk transportation of logging residues. In these systems the handling of the logging residues are carried out in the same manner up to the landings. Moisture content at the time of chipping is the primary quality parameter. Fine fractions of logging residues are strongly dependent on moisture content in storage. Another quality parameter is the natural ash content. What constitutes good fuel quality has no simple answers. Costumer’s requirements are often a determining factor. The <b>heating</b> <b>stations</b> have different prerequisites because the boilers and the systems of the <b>heating</b> <b>stations</b> are different. The quality of logging residues at the time for piling storage seems to determine the quality at chipping. Low moisture at the piling results in low moisture content at chipping. Seasonal impacts during forwarding has effects on moisture content, but heavy precipitation in connection with the forwarding appears to influence the moisture content negatively even when forwarding during the summer season. Long periods with heavy precipitations before chipping appears to affect the moisture content negatively as well...|$|R
