25|$|The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston during World War II, {{marked the}} first {{intentional}} meteorological flight into a hurricane. That summer, British pilots being trained as instrument instructor pilots at Bryan Army Airfield heard that the school was evacuating its AT-6 Texan trainers {{in the face of}} the oncoming hurricane, and began teasing their instructors about the airworthiness of the aircraft. Instrument flying school commander USAAF Lt. Col. Joseph B. Duckworth, a former airline pilot with Eastern Airlines who had developed instrument procedures for the carrier, bet his RAF students that he could safely fly into the storm and return. On 27 July 1943 he took out one of the trainers with 2nd Lt Ralph M. O'Hair navigating and flew it straight into <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> After he returned safely, the base's only weather officer, 1st Lt William H.

The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.|$|E

500|$|While {{the most}} obvious motion of clouds is toward the center, {{tropical}} cyclones also develop an upper-level (high-altitude) outward flow of clouds. These originate from air that has released its moisture and is expelled at high altitude through the [...] "chimney" [...] of the storm engine. This outflow produces high, thin cirrus clouds that spiral away from the center. The clouds are thin enough for the sun to be visible through them. These high cirrus clouds {{may be the first}} signs of an approaching tropical cyclone. As air parcels are lifted within <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> the vorticity is reduced, causing the outflow from a tropical cyclone to have anticyclonic motion. [...] If two tropical cyclones are in proximity to one another, the outflow from the system downstream (normally to the west) can hinder the development of the system upstream (normally to the east).|$|E
