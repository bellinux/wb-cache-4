5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Dewey, {{dressed for}} the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, {{and told him that}} if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{had been}} on duty as wing {{commander}} at RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh when Hess had arrived, and his station {{had been on}}e of those that had tracked the progress of the flight. He arrived at Maryhill Barracks the next morning, and after examining Hess's effects, he met alone with the prisoner. Hess immediately admitted his true identity and outlined the reason for his flight. Hamilton told Hess that he hoped to continue <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> the aid of an interpreter; Hess could speak English well, but was having trouble understanding Hamilton. After the meeting, Hamilton examined the remains of the Messerschmitt in the company of an intelligence officer, then returned to Turnhouse, where he made arrangements through the Foreign Office to meet Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was at Ditchley for the weekend. They had some preliminary talks that night, and Hamilton accompanied Churchill back to London the next day, where they both met with members of the War Cabinet. Churchill sent Hamilton with foreign affairs expert Ivone Kirkpatrick, who had met Hess previously, to positively identify the prisoner, who had been moved to Buchanan Castle overnight. Hess, who had prepared extensive notes to use during this meeting, spoke to them at length about Hitler's expansionary plans and the need for Britain to let the Nazis have free rein in Europe, in exchange for being allowed to keep its overseas possessions. Kirkpatrick held two more meetings with Hess {{over the course of the}} next few days, while Hamilton returned to his duties. Hess, in addition to being disappointed at the apparent failure of his mission, began claiming that his medical treatment was inadequate and that there was a plot afoot to poison him.|$|E

25|$|Walker {{promptly}} telephoned Ford's HQ in Dearborn {{and told}} designer Frank Hershey about <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Crusoe. Hershey took {{the idea and}} began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of 2525lb (1145kg), an Interceptor V8 engine based on the forthcoming overhead-valve Ford V8 slated for 1954 model year introduction, and {{a top speed of}} over 100mph (160km/h). Crusoe saw a painted clay model on May 18, 1953, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September after comparing it with current European trends. After Henry Ford II returned from the Los Angeles Auto Show (Autorama) in 1953 he approved the final design concept to compete with the then new Corvette.|$|E

Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Kurt about what he liked in girls. Rachel confronts Kurt, stating {{that even if he}} is in love with Finn, she will always have a better chance [...] "because [...] a girl".

500|$|To {{accurately}} {{depict the}} time period of the film, the filmmakers conducted extensive research that included studying artwork from the era. With eight weeks to create the wardrobe, costume designer Patricia Norris collaborated with Western Costume to compile costumes that would illustrate {{the passage of time}} while also being historically accurate. Using an earth tone color palette, Norris created nearly 1,000 costumes for the film. [...] "She [...] took earth samples from all three of the plantations to match the clothes," [...] McQueen said, [...] "and she had <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Sean [...] to deal with the character temperature on each plantation, {{there was a lot of}} that minute detail." [...] The filmmakers also used some pieces of clothing discovered on set that were worn by slaves.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 24, Summerfield and Humphreys called Nixon at his Missoula hotel.

The general and governor agreed that Nixon could come to Wheeling with the assurance he would remain on the ticket. After making speeches in Missoula and at a stop in Denver, and after Eisenhower made his own speech announcing that his running mate had {{been the victim of}} an [...] "attempted smear", Nixon arrived in Wheeling late in the day on the 24th. Eisenhower came to the airport to meet the plane, and hurried up the steps to greet the Nixons when the door was opened.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode {{with a score}} of 9.2 out of 10. He thought that after a [...] "stereotypical, over-the-top" [...] {{characterization}} in past episodes, Gaston [...] "stepped up his portrayal" [...] as Harris and was [...] "annoying... {{in a much more}} believable way." [...] Isler found the revelation surrounding Harris to be [...] "deliciously surprising," [...] and wrote that the [...] "last twenty minutes of the episode really ramped up the suspense and action." [...] However, the IGN reviewer thought that while <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Grayson was an [...] "hilarious homage to Leonard Nimoy, it seemed completely superfluous in terms of the overall storyline." [...] Isler concluded his review on a positive note by focusing on Noble's performance, calling it [...] "one of the best scenes [...] has ever done as Walter Bishop. It was emotional, believable, and perfectly accurate for a character that has a high level of self-loathing and remorse for what he's done, and the hopeless frustration {{of not being able to}} remember exactly why he did it." ...|$|E
500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E
500|$|Josh Wigler from MTV {{loved the}} revelations from <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> William Bell, {{along with the}} {{appearance}} of shapeshifters. He thought the episode was Fringe [...] "at its absolute finest," [...] as the [...] "mystery-of-the-week and the overarching plot worked in complete harmony with one another, proving that Fringe is entirely capable of delivering on both a serialized and episodic basis". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker praised guest actor Leonard Nimoy's [...] "terrific, coolly-controlled performance," [...] and wrote that he continued [...] "to admire the way Fringe can mind-meld its scientific fiction with workplace-family drama and light comedy, juggling an increasing number of characters and subplots, while still maintaining a strong narrative through-line". The A.V. Club Noel Murray graded the episode a B+, explaining that the episode was much better than the previous week and also praising the introduction of two new characters and the long awaited meeting between Olivia and William Bell. Murray concluded his review somewhat negatively, [...] "If the whole episode had maintained the [...] "yes we're aware this is kinda nutsy" [...] tone of that one great line, I'd have bumped it up one more notch to the A-level. I'm holding back only because [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] was such an info-dump, and played a fraction too soberly".|$|E
