25|$|Allodynia is {{pain from}} a {{stimulus}} {{that would normally}} not cause pain. For example, there is a patient who experiences unrelenting pain when a breeze <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> skin. Most patients experiencing allodynia, experience pain with touch and pressure, however some can be hypersensitive to temperature.|$|E
25|$|When castling, {{the king}} {{must be the}} first piece touched. If the player <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> rook {{at the same time}} as {{touching}} the king, he must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so. If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. Otherwise, the move must be withdrawn and another king move made.|$|E
25|$|Birds may bite or stab {{with their}} beaks to defend themselves. Some species use their beaks in {{displays}} of various sorts. As {{part of his}} courtship, for example, the male garganey <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> beak to the blue speculum feathers on his wings in a fake preening display, and the male Mandarin duck does the same with his orange sail feathers. A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks.|$|E

25|$|Kon El's {{consciousness}} is {{pulled into a}} pocket universe (dimension) when Jon Lane Kent <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> Psycho Future Self with all other Kons and Jons of the multiverse. The Future Jon taps into all other Kons and Jons except this dimension's Kon and younger Jon. The younger Jon heroically sacrifices himself to destroy the elder Jon, obliterating them both through his TK, sending all the other Jons and Kons back to their respective timelines, dimensions and universes. Jon isn't erased from history, and his actions outside of the pocket universe are well remembered, but he is truly gone, leaving Kon-El once again as Superboy. Kon-El is later revealed to travel all across the world and train and practice various forms of meditation and inner peace of mind as indicated in Supergirl comics. He later joins the Teen Titans.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E
25|$|Aaron, {{the brother}} of Moses, is on the first icon {{on the right side}} of the tier. He {{represented}} the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. In his right hand he holds a crosier decorated with flowers, and a thurible in his left. The next image depicts Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, with a fleece. In the Old Testament, an angel appeared to Gideon, telling him that he would save his tribe from the invading Midianites. Gideon asked for proof of God's message; he laid a fleece of wool on the ground and asked the Lord to make the fleece wet and keep the ground dry by next morning, if the victory were to be his. Next morning the fleece was wet and the ground was dry; Gideon demanded a second test in which the fleece should remain dry while dew covered the rest of the ground and this also happened. Later this narrative was understood as a reference to Jesus' birth. In these explanations the fleece stood for Mary, and the dew signified Christ. King Solomon is portrayed on the next icon. He was the son of King David, and he holds an image signifying the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament credits Solomon with its completion. Another unidentified icon stands close to Solomon's painting. The aged man reaching for the sky is probably Jeremiah, son of a landowner. In the Bible Jeremiah was chosen to prophesy God's anger at the Israelites who worshiped idols. He had to prepare his people for the fall of Jerusalem and for being enslaved. Knowing the fate of his tribe he is usually depicted as an old, worn man looking up to the skies, praying for God's forgiveness. The next icon shows a traditional depiction of Isaiah, in which an angel <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> lips. According to the iconographical traditions the angel fills Isaiah's lips with fire to preach his prophecies without fear. In another interpretation the fire refers to the Book of Isaiah, in which he mentions the burning anger of God. The last icon on the Prophets tier depicts a young man wearing a turban. It is the last uncertain icon in the row, probably portraying Habakkuk. He holds a package containing the stew he took for Daniel when he was in the lion's den with the help of an angel.|$|E

500|$|Mulder {{visits a}} local blood bank where a night {{watchman}} has been recently hired. Mulder has him arrested after he is caught drinking {{blood in the}} facility's storeroom. During his interrogation, the suspect tells Mulder that he belongs to a trio of vampires who desire immortality; he is known as [...] "The Son" [...] while the other two, {{a man and a}} woman, are called [...] "The Father" [...] and [...] "The Unholy Spirit". Mulder does not believe The Son's claims. However, at sunrise, The Son is burned to death when sunlight from the window <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> flesh. Mulder is taken aback, having previously assumed vampires to be purely mythological.|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} Jenna's {{scheme to}} con Carvel, Kenneth {{says that it}} is wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss knew about this [...] "he'd tear us apart with his fangs." [...] This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s. A television commentator opined that the Carvel storyline here referenced the 1973 caper film The Sting that starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as two professional grifters, who decide to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. In addition, after ordering the cakes with mistakes on them at a Carvel location, Grammer <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> nose as a sign to Jenna and Kenneth, who are outside, that he has ordered them, a similar gesture that Newman did in the film.|$|E
500|$|Courtship display {{serves to}} emphasise the male's body and crest size and to waft pheromones towards the female. A {{position}} characteristic {{for the large}} Triturus species is the [...] "cat buckle", where the male's body is kinked and often rests only on the forelegs ("hand stand"). He will also lean towards the female ("lean-in"), rock his body, and flap his tail towards her, sometimes lashing it violently ("whiplash"). If the female shows interest, the ritual enters the third phase, where the male creeps away from her, his tail quivering. When the female <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> tail with her snout, he deposits a packet of sperm (a spermatophore) on the ground. The ritual ends with the male guiding the female over the spermatophore, which she then takes up with her cloaca. In the southern marbled newt, courtship is somewhat different from the larger species in {{that it does not}} seem to involve male [...] "cat buckles" [...] and [...] "whiplashes", but instead slower tail fanning and undulating of the tail tip (presumably to mimic a prey animal and lure the female).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} after the Civil War {{commercial}} interests started building taller and more massive edifices along North Pearl and State streets. Albany native Edward Ogden designed the 1873 Kenmore Hotel on North Pearl, and expanded it in 1891 with Queen Anne <b>touches.</b> <b>His</b> 1889 Albany Business College building opposite the Kenmore likewise uses the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Another local architect, Albert Puller, had given downtown the YMCA building at 60 North Pearl, in that style three years earlier ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Leo Bloom, a mousy accountant, {{comes to}} Max's office to audit his books. When one of Max's {{little old lady}} [...] "investors" [...] arrives, Max tells Leo {{to wait in the}} {{bathroom}} until she leaves. She plays a sex game with Max, who eventually persuades her to give him a check to be invested in his next play, to be called [...] "Cash". Leo reveals his lifelong dream: he's {{always wanted to be a}} Broadway producer. After a panic attack when Max <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> blue blanket, Leo tells Max that he has found an accounting error in his books: Max raised $100,000 for [...] "Funny Boy", but the play only cost $98,000. Max begs Leo to cook the books to hide the discrepancy. Leo reluctantly agrees. After some calculations, he realizes that [...] "under the right circumstances, a producer could actually make more money with a flop than he can with a hit. ... You could've raised a million dollars, put on your $100,000 flop, and kept the rest!" [...] Max proposes a scheme: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pursued by Michael, Jamie {{runs down}} the street and finds Loomis. They take shelter in the school, but Michael appears and subdues Loomis before chasing Jamie through the building. Jamie trips and falls down a flight of stairs. Before Michael can kill her, Rachel, who survived the fall, subdues him with a fire extinguisher. The lynch mob and the state police arrive at the school after hearing the alarm go off. The lynch mob agrees to take Jamie and Rachel to the next town in a pickup truck. However, Michael climbs aboard the truck and kills the men. Rachel is forced to drive, {{continuously}} attempting to throw Michael off. She succeeds in doing so and then rams him with the truck, sending him flying into a ditch near an abandoned mine. Sheriff Meeker, Loomis, surviving members of the lynch mob, and the state police arrive, but when Jamie approaches Michael and <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> hand, he rises. Meeker, the state police, and the lynch mob relentlessly shoot Michael until he falls down the mine.|$|E
