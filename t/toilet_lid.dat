5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, they see a portion of Lewton's intestine hanging from a tree. Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a <b>toilet</b> <b>lid,</b> she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
25|$|After {{being left}} {{to die in}} a {{bathroom}} with several corpses, trapped by chains on his feet, by Amanda Young, Detective Eric Matthews looks for a way to escape, still believing his son Daniel is being held captive by John Kramer, the Jigsaw killer. Eric at first attempts to cut off his chained foot with a hacksaw, but is unable to do it. Instead, Eric grabs a dislodged <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> and breaks his foot with it, slipping out of his chains and escaping.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} a heated seat, {{which may be}} adjustable from 30°C to 40°C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on {{the location of the}} user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter [...] (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frühlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E
5000|$|Luis Piedrahita Cuesta (born 1977 in Coruña, Spain) is a Spanish {{stand-up}} comedian, magician, script writer, broadcaster and author.

50|$|Toto {{introduced}} a sensor that detects whether the user is seated or not, throughout the product lineup (earlier washlets activated {{regardless of whether}} the user was seated or not). The company added new functions including <b>toilet</b> <b>lids</b> that automatically open and close, toilet cleansing, deodorant, gas absorbant, and air refresher. Complete toilets with built-in washlets were introduced (“Neo-rest” and “GG”) and Toto's product lineup of washlets designed for public facilities, business offices, and hotels was strengthened.|$|R

50|$|One {{study found}} that {{lowering}} the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> prevented dispersion of large droplets and reduced the airborne bacteria concentrations {{by a factor of}} 12. The study recommended discouraging the use of lidless toilets, which contradicts the U.S. Uniform Plumbing Code specifications for public toilets.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} {{indirect}} evidence that aerosols containing pathogens {{could potentially be}} spread by a toilet plume, as of 2013 no direct experimental studies had clearly demonstrated or refuted actual disease transmission from toilet aerosols, and the risk had not been well characterized. It has been hypothesized that dispersal of pathogens may be reduced by closing the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> before flushing, and by using toilets with lower flush energy.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} contests {{that take place}} during the festival as well. Throughout the weekend a 5k is run, there are the [...] "Chick-O-Lympics" [...] for children. There are also corn hole tournaments, a volleyball tournament, a hot wing eating contest, karaoke contests, rooster crowing, chicken clucking, and strutting competition, and an egg drop contest. The biggest of the contests however are the London Kentucky Olympics, including things such as <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> horseshoes and belching contests.|$|E
50|$|Decorative textile {{covers for}} the <b>toilet</b> seat <b>lid</b> {{have gone in}} and out of fashion. Advocates claim that they allow the toilet {{to be used as a}} more {{comfortable}} seat and provide another way of decorating a bathroom, while critics view them as a sanitation problem which creates unnecessary work.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} mechanism {{which is}} in development by the Asian Institute of Technolog, Auto Cleaning Toilet Seat, L.L.C., and others {{involves the use of}} a <b>toilet</b> seat <b>lid</b> that after each use is closing and covering the toilet seat. At that point began the process of washing, disinfecting and drying the toilet seat.|$|R
25|$|A two-piece {{attaching}} {{seat and}} <b>toilet</b> bowl <b>lid</b> are typically mounted over the bowl to allow covering the toilet {{when it is}} not in use and to provide seating comfort. The seat may be installed at the factory, or the parts may be sold separately and assembled by a plumbing distributor or the installer.|$|R

5000|$|Confusingly, {{the term}} is also {{sometimes}} used for decorative covers for the toilet seat, or even the <b>toilet</b> seat <b>lid,</b> if present. These covers generally do not serve a sanitary purpose, and may even pose difficulties with cleaning and sanitization if they are made of porous materials or are unsuitably shaped. The descriptive qualifier [...] "disposable" [...] is added to clarify the intended use of some toilet seat covers.|$|R
500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{features}} {{a number of}} references to popular culture and famous dogs. Santa's Little Helper's adventure resembles {{the plot of the}} 1963 film The Incredible Journey. The scene in which Mr. Burns brainwashes Santa's Little Helper with the Ludovico technique is a parody of Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange, including the way Santa's Little Helper's eyes are held open while he is forced to watch a film featuring dog abuse, such as dogs being physically assaulted and getting their heads slammed by falling <b>toilet</b> <b>lids.</b> Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony is heard during the sequence. In another scene, the dog Lassie is referenced when Santa's Little Helper rescues a child from a burning building. Homer claims that Santa's Little Helper will be going to Doggie Heaven, while Richard Nixon's dog Checkers and Adolf Hitler's dog Blondi will be going to Doggie Hell. The doctor who performs the surgery on Santa's Little Helper is based on the main character in the Ben Casey television series.|$|R
50|$|Chemical toilets {{are large}} enough for a single occupant, usually about 110 cm square by 210 cm high. While the units are {{typically}} free-standing structures, their stability is augmented {{by the weight of}} the waste tank, which usually contains an empty liquid disinfectant dispenser and deodorizer. Some include both a seated toilet and a urinal. Most include lockable doors, ventilation near the top, and a vent pipe for the holding tank. When wind is blowing over the vent pipe it creates a low pressure area sucking the odor out. Leaving the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> open will reverse the flow of the venting of the tank.|$|E
5000|$|The players open a wine {{cabinet and}} have drinks, except for Duffy, who {{returns to his}} room. Lea goes for a walk and Jay sits at his bed. Francis leaves with a glass stopper; he breaks it in the bathroom, and hides some shards under the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid.</b> Shona, Claire and Max get drunk. Al B flirts and dances with Cynthia, until Francis arrives. The two men fight, but when Cynthia intervenes, Al B pushes her and knocks {{the back of her}} head against the stone railing, which causes her death. Jay [...] "arrests" [...] Al B, and locks him in a room using a pipe.|$|E

25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of <b>toilets</b> a <b>lid</b> need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|R

50|$|One night, Jonesy sees Duddits beckoning him {{to cross}} the street, but as he does so Jonesy is hit by a car. His {{injuries}} heal with mysterious speed and six months later {{he is able to}} make it for the group's annual trip. Jonesy rescues a man lost in the forest named Rick McCarthy. He is very ill, so Jonesy and Beaver let him rest and recover inside their cabin. Suddenly, herds of forest animals flee past their cabin, followed by two military helicopters that announce the area is now quarantined. Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick is sitting semi-catatonic on the toilet, which is now covered in blood. Rick is thrown from the toilet, dead into the tub as a creature writhes and screams in the toilet. Beaver attempts to trap the creature under the <b>toilet</b> <b>lid,</b> but the three-foot long lamprey-like creature, with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth, kills him. Jonesy tries to escape but is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Gray, who possesses Jonesy's body and emits a red-dust around the entire cabin.|$|E
5000|$|A very {{ordinary}} man named Howard Mitla, {{who has a}} strange aptitude for Jeopardy!, is confronted by the bizarre sight of a human finger poking {{its way out of}} the drain in his apartment's bathroom sink. He tries to deny the reality of what is happening, but the solitary digit eventually proves to be infinitely long and multijointed, and capable of attacking him. Mitla burns it with a bottle of heavy-duty drain cleaner, then chops it off with a pair of electric hedge trimmers. Howard, after cutting up the finger, starts thinking about the creature to which it was attached. He realizes it really had multiple digits and that there were several openings in an average bathroom, and an ominous sound is heard from the toilet. Investigating reports of noise coming from Howard's apartment, the police arrive to find him lying in a daze next to the toilet. He tells them, [...] "If {{you have to go to}} the bathroom, I definitely suggest you hold it." [...] The <b>toilet</b> <b>lid</b> pops up.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to produce and evaluate high-performance wood fiber composites. High-performance was defined as: high dimensional stability and a high durability, including resistance to wood-decaying organisms (fungi, bacteria, and insects). The main method, used to accomplish these properties, was acetylation of the wood fibers prior to the composite production. Acetylation involves a chemical modification of wood components, which {{was carried out by}} reaction with acetic anhydride. Another method applied was impregnation with kraft lignin followed by fixation of the lignin with an aluminum salt solution. Thus, lignin metal complexes are formed in situ - complexes that are insoluble under normal conditions in the environment. Test results show that both methods lead to more dimensionally stable composites, i. e. reduced swelling and shrinkage due to a varying moisture load. Kraft lignin treatment of wood fiber was estimated to be an economical method for obtaining a certain degree of stabilization of composites (fiberboards), although the composites cannot be labeled "high-performance" since they do not meet all requirements, as defined above. However, the use of acetylated fibers leads to a very high degree of dimensional stability as well as biological decay resistance and, furthermore, the mechanical properties are maintained during and after cyclic climate aging. Regardless of the lignocellulosic fiber source used, the thickness swelling of acetylated fiberboards in water is reduced by approximately 90 % and results from cyclic testing according to EN 321 (three cycles, each comprising 72 h water immersion, 24 h freezing at - 18 °C and 72 h drying at 70 °C) show that more than 85 % of the original internal bond strength, IBS, remains after testing. The latter figure should be compared with the corresponding value of 20 - 40 % obtained for fiberboards made from unmodified fibers. Acetylated wood fiber composites have also been tested for resistance to biological decay in a worldwide field test where 30 cm long fiberboard stakes were half-buried in soil. After three years of testing, most of the control stakes (made from unmodified fiber) had failed due to heavy decay while most of the acetylated composite stakes were perfectly sound, showing no sign of decay. To determine whether the acetylation, and other methods of chemical modification, cause any degradation of the cellulose,. alfa. -cellulose was isolated from unmodified and chemically modified fibers after which the intrinsic viscosity and molecular mass distribution (determined by size exclusion chromatography) of the cellulose samples were analyzed. The main part of the cellulose from acetylated wood fiber seems to be unaffected by the modification method, whereas the other modification methods appear to yield more or less degraded cellulose. In order to manufacture products with complex shapes, moldable flexible fibermats were produced on both a small pilot scale (kilograms) and on a large scale (over one metric ton). A variety of industrial products were manufactured from the acetylated fibermats: exterior doors, automotive panels, façade claddings, flooring boards, wet-room wall panels, <b>toilet</b> <b>lids</b> and roof tiles. Generally, {{it was found that the}} dimensional stability of the products was high and that other important properties, such as mechanical and weathering properties, were also very satisfactory. The conclusion is that composites based on acetylated wood fiber are truly high-performance, as defined above...|$|R
