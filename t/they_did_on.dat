5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E
5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This criminal act had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E
5|$|With the Ottoman {{annexation}} of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight {{to control the}} city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies {{for the maintenance of}} the mosque, though <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.|$|E

5|$|The Chiefs won the toss and {{deferred}} {{until the}} second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points {{late in the first}} quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17–3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs.|$|E

The army led by Louis of Baden {{occupied}} the city on 14 October and destroyed the aqueduct leading to the castle.

25|$|Through the Chinese ambassador, Zhou {{requested}} {{and received}} permission for Chinese embassy staff {{to inspect the}} wreckage of Lin's plane, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> September 15–16.

Zhou then sent additional staff to interview Mongolian witnesses of the crash, and to perform a detailed technical assessment of the crash. The report concluded that the plane had approximately 30 minutes of fuel when it crashed, but attempted to land without activating its landing gear or wing flaps.|$|E
25|$|Unlike promotional models {{which had}} sealed hoods, no engine detail and basic {{suspension}} detail molded into the chassis, kits usually had opening hoods, full engine detail, complete interiors and detailed multi-part suspensions. Earlier kits had less chassis detail and featured promo-like interiors, metal axles, whitewall tires and screws {{to attach the}} body to the chassis. Later kits often had more detail but metal parts such as axles, screws and hood clips were either deleted or made of plastic instead. Miniature whitewall tires, which were once a regular feature of kits, became outdated and modern blackwall tires took their place as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> actual cars.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} {{study by the}} Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind the shops, and the blood often flowed out into the streets. The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by regrattiers who specialized in this trade.|$|E

After {{consulting}} with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander of the People's Volunteer Army, a special unit of the People's Liberation Army, China's armed forces that would intervene in the Korean War and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander of the PVA.

500|$|... "Irreplaceable JP" [...] {{was written}} for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyoncé's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said {{that they might not}} have gone in the {{direction}} <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E
500|$|With the American Revolutionary War beginning, {{many thought}} {{it would be easy to}} spread the {{rebellion}} to the Province of Quebec, which had only been conquered by the British in 1759, and whose population was seen as resentful of British rule. [...] The American invasion of Quebec began with the arrival at Île aux Noix of the Continental Army under the command of General Philip Schuyler on September 4, 1775. [...] Schuyler, who was ill at the time, eventually turned command of the army over the General Richard Montgomery, who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint-Jean, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> September 18.

Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> record, so we thought we better go back and record them again."
