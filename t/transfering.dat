The development of this application is encompassing four primary activities in developing an expert system, namely: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge inferencing, and knowledge <b>transfering.</b> Knowledge acquisition is a process of acquisition or <b>transfering</b> knowledge or expertise of an expert through a knowledge engineer. Knowledge representation is a process of <b>transfering</b> knowledge into a computer based system. Knowledge inferencing is a reasoning process performed by an expert system to draw a conclusion or a final result. The reasoning process applies a forward-chaining method. Knowledge <b>transfering</b> is a process of <b>transfering</b> knowledge from an expert system to a user (non-expert one) through a user interface of the expert system. This expert system has been tested to about 300 users. This simple system generally runs quite well although there are still some weakness to refine in the further research. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{determine}} the scope of one of more important functions of a family, i. e. the socialization-educational function. Therefore, it was necessary to explain and specify the notions of „function", „socialization" and.,education" as well as to list more important definitions of these notions presented in the literature. Taking into account general considerations on the notion of „function" contained in her article, the author proposes to define „the function of the family" as the totality of the family's activities and consequences of these activities which contribute to carrying out the tasks the family is to fulfil. In turn, the essence and content? of the socialization-educational function is the implementation of the following tasks: 1) <b>transfering</b> and acquiring material and spiritual cultural heritage; 2) <b>transfering</b> and acquiring the native language; 3) determining, <b>transfering</b> and acquring the system of values; 4) determining, <b>transfering</b> and acquiring the means by which the desired values may be achieved and providing motivation for activities; 5) determining, <b>transfering</b> and acquiring the models of behaviours together with the capacity to perform various social roles inside and outside the family; 6) controlling and evaluating behaviours of family members and applying sanctions.
