40|$|B ilitranslocase (TC 2. A. 65. 1. 1) is a plasma {{membrane}} transporter {{expressed in the}} gastro-intestinal epithelium (luminal side), the liver and kidney (vascular side) (1) and in the vascular endothelium (2). It transports bilirubin, flavonoids and other organic anions. By using specific anti-sequence bilitranslocase antibodies targeting extracellular epitopes critical for the carrier function, we can investigate both the tissue and cellular localisation of the protein and its function in absorption and tissue distribution of flavonoids, by a system of in vitro methods featured by increasing structural complexity: i) {{plasma membrane}} vesicles, ii) cell cultures, iii) tissue fragments, and iv) isolated organs. The best example of implementation of this chain of in vitro methods is the cardiovascular system, where consistent observations were obtained throughout the chain. It can be concluded that the first method, i. e. a bilitranslocase-specific functional assay (3) in membrane vesicles where potential ligands (competitive and non-competitive inhibitors) are identified, yields data predictive of bilitranslocase function in organs. This approach can be helpful for exploiting bilitranslocase as a membrane transporter in drug targeting and development. 1 Passamonti S, Terdoslavich M, Franca R, Vanzo A, <b>Tramer</b> F, Braidot E, et al.

40|$|Distortions in {{incidence}} {{data are}} probably {{responsible for the}} appar-ent excess of schizophrenia among people born in winter. The widely held belief that the excess reflects a winter component in the etiology of schizophrenia is based on errors {{in the design and}} interpretation of seasonal studies. In 1929, when schizophrenia was still commonly known as dementia praecox, when the predominant theories of etiology were toxic endocrine poisons and poor mental hygiene, when generic involvement was still just a suspicion and the primary treatment was occupational therapy—in that distant year, <b>Tramer</b> first reported that an excess number of future schizophrenic patients appeared to be born in winter. It was a promising find in an era of little promise. Seasonality was one of Hippocrates ' great clues to the etiology of disease, and no one familiar with the history of medicine would have been sur-prised if within a year or two of Tramer's report, someone had turned up a cold weather variable responsible for some forms of schizophrenia. The importance of seasonality can be illustrated by another finding of the same era. Maxcy's (1926) report that typhus fever had different peak seasons in the United States and Europe led to the unexpected dis-covery that two diseases with identical symptoms were involved. Within 5 years the seasonal vector for American typhus was identified, and control of the disease was established (Dyer et al. 1931). Schizophrenia has not yielded to seasonal study as gracefully as typhus. Sixty years after <b>Tramer,</b> we know only that although there is disagreement, the obvious winter variables (e. g., temperature) {{do not appear to be}} responsible and that a confusing array of other variables do. The situation is illustrated in table 1, which lists some recent findings. The theory with the most explanatory power attributes sea-sonality to harmful environmental agents, but no theory explains even half of the results, and there is no consistent pattern across studies (compare, e. g., Kendler [1982] wit...|$|E
30|$|Detection and {{exclusion}} of duplicate data {{is an important}} step in conducting a meta-analysis. Our study found an increase in the mean effect size and fail-safe number with duplicated data. This finding means that the effect and reliability was overestimated in a meta-analysis. Multiple publication bias may be an important threat to the validity of meta-analyses. Most importantly, studies with significant results are more likely to lead to multiple publications and presentations (Easterbrook et al. 1991), which makes it more likely that they will be located and included in a meta-analysis. For instance, <b>Tramer</b> et al. (1997) concluded that the inclusion of redundant data in a meta-analysis led to a 23 % overestimation of the treatment effectiveness of an antiemetic agent. Murphy and Wyllie (2009) reported that removing the overlapping case would decrease the sample size by 20 % in a meta-analysis that quantified the association between initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and increased mortality in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the association between}} the risk of schizophrenia and season of birth are reviewed and the association dearly established. This association cannot be explained {{on the basis of}} age-incidence or age-prevalence artifacts. Other studies suggest there may be an association between bipolar disorder and season of birth. The leading theory in explaining the season of birth phenomenon is that a seasonal factor (such as viral infection, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, prenatal or obstetrical complications, or ambient temperature) can damage an infant's brain and thereby predispose the child to later development of psychosis. Evidence suggests that the seasonal effect is associated with a subgroup of schizophrenics who have early onset of psychosis, less genetic loading than other schizophrenics, and better prognosis. Case-control studies are needed comparing winter-born to nonwinter-born schizo-phrenics. Since 1929, {{it has been reported that}} more schizophrenics are born during the winter and early spring than during other seasons (<b>Tramer</b> 1929). Although the basis for this finding is unknown, it has been suggested that it may be a clue to the identification of a subtype of schizophrenia (Dalen 1975). Some studies also indicate that this is true for patients with bipolar affective disorder (mania) (Hare...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} seed {{dispersal}} between the widely separated forest patches (forest islands) {{of the eastern}} Great Plains can contribute to understanding effects of deforestation in the more complex forest island landscapes of the eastern United States. In the East, there is growing concern that the dissection of regional forests {{and the creation of}} small forest islands surrounded by non-forest uses (e. g., agriculture) may be affecting plant species richness and developmental patterns of vegetation (Levenson 1976), as has already been noted in the tropics (Gomezpompa et al. 1972). Curtis (1956) showed that the presettlement forest area in a portion of Green County, Wisconsin had been reduced by 70 % as of 1882, 90 % by 1902, 95 % by 1935, and more than 96 % by 1950. The effect of distance in altering seed exchange between forest islands has not been directly tested. However, the use of forest islands as study sites has provided some clues about the effects of distance (isolation) on dispersal and forest composition. Scanlan (1975), <b>Tramer</b> and Suhrweir (1975), and Levenson (1976) all noted that the species richness of forest stands in Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, respectively, was inversely proportional to the degree of isolation from neighboring stands. It is not clearly understood whether the characteristics of deforested landscapes preferentially reduce the abundance of species with certain dispersal characteristics (e. g., heavy animal-dispersed and heavy wind-dispersed seeds) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the antiemetic efficacy and {{adverse effects of}} cannabis used for sickness induced chemotherapy. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Systematic search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, bibliographies), any language, to August 2000. Studies: 30 randomised comparisons of cannabis with placebo or antiemetics from which dichotomous data on efficacy and harm were available (1366 patients). Oral nabilone, oral dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol), and intramuscular levonantradol were tested. No cannabis was smoked. Follow up lasted 24 hours. Results: Cannabinoids were more effective antiemetics than prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, thiethylperazine, haloperidol, domperidone, or alizapride: relative risk 1. 38 (95 % confidence interval 1. 18 to 1. 62), number needed to treat 6 for complete control of nausea; 1. 28 (1. 08 to 1. 51), NNT 8 for complete control of vomiting. Cannabinoids were not more effective in patients receiving very low or very high emetogenic chemotherapy. In crossover trials, patients preferred cannabinoids for future chemotherapy cycles: 2. 39 (2. 05 to 2. 78), NNT 3. Some potentially beneficial side effects occurred more often with cannabinoids: "high" 10. 6 (6. 86 to 16. 5), NNT 3; sedation or drowsiness 1. 66 (1. 46 to 1. 89); euphoria 12. 5 (3. 00 to 52. 1), NNT 7. Harmful side effects also occurred more often with cannabinoids: dizziness 2. 97 (2. 31 - 3. 83), NNT 3; dysphoria or depression 8. 06 (3. 38 - 19. 2), NNT 8; hallucinations 6. 10 (2. 41 - 15. 4), NNT 17; paranoia 8. 58 (6. 38 to 11. 5), NNT 20; and arterial hypotension 2. 23 (1. 75 to 2. 83), NNT 7. Patients given cannabinoids {{were more likely to}} withdraw due to side effects 4. 67 (3. 07 to 7. 09), NNT 11. Conclusions: In selected patients, the cannabinoids tested in these trials may be useful as mood enhancing adjuvants for controlling chemotherapy related sickness. Potentially serious adverse effects, even when taken short term orally or intramuscularly, are likely to limit their widespread use. Citation: <b>Tramèr,</b> M. R. et al. (2001).

The Council of Jews from Germany (Council for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Jews from Germany) is the umbrella organization of organizations built up by Jews from Germany and other Central European countries in their countries of resettlement after fleeing Nazi Germany. It represents the interests of former German Jews in matters of restitution and indemnification, legislation, contacts with successor organizations for heirless Jewish property in West Germany, and social work activities. Founded in 1945 in London, the first member organizations were Israel's Irgun Olei Merkaz Europa (IOME), the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe, and the Association of Jewish Refugees in Great Britain. It also has affiliates in other countries. In the immediate post-war period, the Council's activities centered on restitution advocacy for Jews who had lived in Germany before World War II. The area of German restitution payments was complex, with claims also put forth by Jews living in Germany after the war (so-called successor communities), by worldwide Jewish organizations such as the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the World Jewish Committee (WJC), and by the state of Israel. In this mix of competing claims, which was made more complicated by reluctance of the western powers to press for restitution as well as by German reluctance, the Council forcefully asserted the "moral claims" of Jews who had lived in Germany before the war. Many of these issues were resolved by the mid- 1950 s. The Luxembourg Agreements of 1952, between West Germany, Israel, and the Claims Conference, created a framework for future restitution and indemnification claims. The American Court of Restitutions Appeals (CORA), in its 1954 Augsburg decision, determined that the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO), rather than successor communities in Germany, was the proper legal successor for German-Jewish heirless communal property. However, disagreements remained, with the Council briefly withdrawing from the JRSO in 1954 after a failure to agree about the allocation of payments. The Council of Jews from Germany was central to many post-war Jewish organizations. It was instrumental in the founding of the United Restitution Organization (URO) in 1945, and was also intimately involved in Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO), which was set up in 1946 in the United States zone of western Germany. The Council was also a founding member of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany (1951), and helped create the Leo Baeck Institute (1955). The first president of the Council was Leo Baeck, who was succeeded by Siegfried Moses in 1957. After the death of Siegfried Moses in 1974, three joint chairmen were elected. The Council's secretaries were Kurt Alexander (1945 - 1949), Hans Reichmann (1949 - 1955), Ernst Berent (1955 - 1961), Bruno Woyda (1961 - 1967), and Werner Rosenstock.

Included in the collection are personal papers such as vital documents and correspondence, business records including balance sheets and account books, correspondence, certificates and official announcements. Other papers include family trees, genealogical notes, and articles and essays about the family and their business. The following individuals are mentioned in this collection:Auerbach, Siegfried; Hildesheimer, A; Hirsch, Aron; Hirsch, Benjamin; Hirsch, Siegmund; Rau, Max; Rau, Moses; Schmidt, Rudolf; Schwab, Hermann; <b>Tramer,</b> Hans; Weltsch, Robert. In 1780 the Rabbi Naphtali Hirsch Gumprecht Göttingen moved to Halberstadt to attend the city's "Klaus" (an institution for Talmudic study). His eldest son was Aron Gumprecht Göttingen, born in Halberstadt in 1783. Following the Napoleonic edict that required Jews to select surnames in 1808, Aron chose the name "Hirsch. "In 1805 Aron Hirsch (1783 - 1842) founded a metal business, taking advantage of existing copper and silver mines in the nearby Harz mountains. Eventually, his son Joseph (1809 - 1871) and other relatives joined the new family business “Aron Hirsch & Sohn”, which expanded to trade in copper, tin, zinc, and lead, as well as in alloys and chemicals. By the mid- 1800 s Halberstadt had become a center of the metal trade in Europe. Throughout his life, Joseph Hirsch was not only active in the Jewish community of Halberstadt, but he also initiated charitable institutions city-wide. He befriended Halberstadt’s well-known rabbi Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, whose children, Julie and Selig married Joseph Hirsch’s children Benjamin and Rosa. In 1863, Joseph Hirsch’s brother Gustav (1822 - 1898) extended the firm to include the brass works (Messingwerke) near Eberswald in Prussia, close to the Finow Canal. Following Joseph Hirsch’s death in 1871, his eldest son Benjamin took over the firm's leadership. Benjamin Hirsch (1840 - 1911) was instrumental in expanding the firm's international connections to London, New York and Australia, and he acquired the mines of Tetiutse near Vladivostock in Russia, whose government forced him to change his religion. As his father before him, Benjamin Hirsch was head of the Jewish community in Halberstadt, and he helped found the local B'nai B'rith Lodge and bestowed aid to many other Jewish philanthropies. In 1906 the firm created the Hirsch, Kupfer und Messingwerke AG in Berlin, specializing in alloys from the brass and copper works near Eberswald and Ilsenburg. The metal trade continued under the name Aron Hirsch & Sohn, and was still administrated from the parent firm in Halberstadt. Following the death of Benjamin Hirsch in 1911, his nephew Aron (1858 - 1941; son of Benjamin’s brother Siegmund, 1831 - 1877) took over the leadership of Hirsch, Kupfer und Messingwerke AG in Berlin, passing on the leadership to his own son, Siegmund after World War I. In 1938, following the liquidation of Hirsch, Kupfer und Messingwerke AG in 1932, Siegmund Hirsch went to Egypt, where he established the Egyptian Copper Works.

Johannes Urzidil was born in Prague on February 3, 1896, the youngest son of a railroad official (Eisenbahnbeamter) who was also an inventor. His mother, Elisabeth von Steinitz, was his father’s second wife and died when Johannes Urzidil was 4 years old. From 1914 through 1919 Urzidil studied German studies, Slavic studies, and art history at the University of Prague. A schoolfriend of his introduced Urzidil to the Café Arco, where he became acquainted with the members of the "Prager Kreis," including Franz Kafka, Franz Werfel, and Max Brod. His studies were interrupted from 1916 - 1918 when Johannes Urzidil served in the Austro-Hungarian military during World War I. From 1918 - 1922 he worked as a translator for the German Consulate in Prague, also writing during the same time period for the the Berlin Börsen-Courier and the Wolffsche Telegraphen-Bureau. In 1922 Urzidil was appointed to the position of press attaché for the German Legation in Prague, a position he held until 1933. In 1922 Johannes Urzidil also married his wife, the poet Gertrude Thieberger, daughter of a rabbi and sister to the writer Friedrich Thieberger. In 1924 Franz Kafka died, and Johannes Urzidil spoke at a memorial for him. By 1933 Urzidil had lost his position as press attaché as Nazism rose to power in Germany. He was arrested by the police on suspicion of espionage but was freed, and shortly thereafter registered with the American Consulate in Prague for visas for himself and his wife to go to the United States. After the Gestapo began searching for Johannes Urzidil, they fled Prague using false papers, still awaiting word from the American Consulate. While the Urzidils waited in Italy, Gertrude Urzidil's sister in London placed their names on a list of politically endangered persons, {{and they were able to}} receive visas for Britain. The English writer Bryher (Anne Winnifred Ellerman), with whom Johannes Urzidil had exchanged letters, assisted them in affording the voyage to England and a place to stay while residing there. They would remain there until 1941 when the Urzidils emigrated to the United States. During the time they lived in England Johannes Urzidil became involved with writing articles for expatriate newspapers to support the position of the government of Edvard Bene, known alternatively as the Czechoslovak National Committee (after December 1939), the Provisional Czechoslovakian Government (after July 1940), and the official Czechoslovak government in exile (after June 18, 1941). In March 1940 Johannes Urzidil met Edvard Bene and was sent to the United States as an official correspondent for the Czechoslovak expatriate publications Cechoslovak and the Central European Observer. Johannes and Gertrude Urzidil arrived in New York in February 1941. Although they first lived in Jackson Heights, they eventually moved to Kew Gardens in Queens, New York. Once more the writer Bryher helped them financially as they started their new life in the United States. Johannes Urzidil discovered that the salary he earned writing for the Cechoslovák and the Central European Observer was not enough to support himself and Gertrude; he made leather handicrafts and Gertrude Urzidil looked after children to earn extra income. Following their arrival in New York Johannes Urzidil found himself at odds with the Bene government's policy on the resettlement of Sudeten Germans when he published articles in 1941 and 1942 critical of resettlement in the publication Aufbau. Finally Urzidil secured a job proofreading for a publishing company after the end of World War II. While working for this company Johannes Urzidil met Heinz Risse, who would become an important friend for him by assisting in securing publication of Die verlorene Geliebte and introducing him to literary magazine publishers and positions with radio stations. By 1951 he was working as a script writer and information specialist for Voice of America, a position Johannes Urzidil kept until 1953 when rising McCarthyism drove him out of the position. He later returned to work for Voice of America in a freelance capacity. By the 1960 s Johannes Urzidil often traveled back to Europe to give lectures and talks for various institutions and organizations, usually travelling with Gertrude, although they never returned permanently to Europe. The topics of his lectures concerned such subjects as Franz Kafka and the "Prager Kreis," Goethe, his own works, and the artist Vaclav Hollar, among other topics. Throughout his life Johannes Urzidil wrote not only articles, essays, and radio scripts but also longer works, poetry and fiction in German. His first poetry was published when he was only 17 years old, under the pseudonym Hans Elmar in a Prague newspaper. Some early writings of his were published in expressionist publications such as Die Friede and Der Mensch. In 1919 Urzidil's first volume of poetry Die Sturz der Verdammten was published. His other volumes of poetry were Die Stimme in 1930 and Die Memnonsäule in 1957. One of his most well-known works, Goethe in Böhmen, was published in 1932. Bohemia was a common topic in most of Johannes Urzidil's writings, including such works of his as Die verlorene Geliebte, which won the Charles Veillon Prize in 1956. The lyrical work Prager Triptychon, and Die Entführung und sieben andere Ereignisse were two other fictional pieces which featured Bohemia. Some of his works deal with life in America, including Das große Hallelujah, Vaterliches aus Prag und Handwerkliches aus New York. Der Trauermantel focused on the life of the writer Adalbert Stifter. Johannes Urzidil died in Rome on November 2, 1970, where he was to give a lecture for the Austrian Institute. He was buried in Campo Santo Teutonico, the German cemetery there. Gertrude Urzidil died in New York on June 12, 1977, and was buried in the cemetery in the town where she was born, Goltsch-Janikay, Austria (now Golcuv Jenikov, Czech Republic). 14 -page inventory.
