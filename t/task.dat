40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} fixed priority scheduling of non-preemptive strict periodic <b>tasks</b> in conjunction with sporadic preemptive <b>tasks.</b> There are few studies about the scheduling problem combining these two kinds of <b>tasks.</b> Moreover, only few results are available on scheduling non-preemptive strict periodic <b>tasks</b> since their performance analysis gives low success ratios, except {{in the case of}} harmonic <b>tasks.</b> Also, strict periodic <b>tasks</b> are of great importance since they are in charge for example of sensors/actuators or feedback control functions which are all critical in feedback control systems. Such <b>tasks</b> must have the highest priorities in order to guarantee a correct behavior of the control system. Preemptive sporadic <b>tasks</b> can be used for non critical functions and have lower priorities. We first investigate the scheduling problem of non-preemptive strict periodic <b>tasks</b> by recalling an existing schedulability condition. This results in defining the first release times of strict periodic <b>tasks</b> that preserves the strict periodicity constraints. We show that the schedule of strict periodic <b>tasks</b> can have transient and permanent phases. Then, assuming that some non-preemptive strict periodic <b>tasks</b> have been scheduled, we characterize the release times of the sporadic <b>tasks</b> that maximize their worst case response times. We prove that these release times can be restricted to the permanent phase. For preemptive sporadic <b>tasks,</b> we extend the classical worst case response time computation to take into account non-preemptive strict periodic <b>tasks.</b> Finally, we {{consider the}} particular case where some of the sporadic <b>tasks</b> are alternate <b>tasks</b> to primary strict periodic <b>tasks</b> for fault-tolerance...|$|R

Our analysis showed that only about 10 % of the <b>tasks</b> in the textbooks are context-based <b>tasks.</b> Moreover, at least 85 % of these <b>tasks</b> provide exactly the information needed to solve them and do not leave room for students to select relevant information by themselves. Furthermore, of the context-based <b>tasks,</b> 45 % are reproduction <b>tasks</b> requiring performing routine mathematical procedures, 53 % are connection <b>tasks</b> requiring linking different mathematical curriculum strands, and only 2 % are reflection <b>tasks,</b> which are considered as <b>tasks</b> with the highest level of cognitive demand. A linkage between {{the findings}} of the error analysis and the textbook analysis suggests that the lacking opportunity-to-learn in Indonesian mathematics textbooks may cause Indonesian students’ difficulties in solving context-based <b>tasks.</b> Based on the results of this study, recommendations are given for improving the opportunities-to-learn to solve context-based <b>tasks</b> as well as for doing further research on this topic...|$|R
