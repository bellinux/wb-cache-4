40|$|This paper {{presents}} flutter {{and forced}} oscillation experiments in a transonic wind tunnel. For an aeroelastic supercritical 2 -D airfoil configuration we studied typical transonic phenomena in as pure a form as possible. Various manifestations of small-amplitude limit cycle oscillations were observed for different flow conditions {{as well as}} coexisting limit cycles. We demonstrated how very small control forces were sufficient to excite or suppress flutter oscillations. Limit cycle oscillations occurred under free and forced turbulent boundary layer transition in a perforated wall test-section. Flutter calculations based on experimental aerodynamic forces yield stability limits which show good agreement with directly measured experimental flutter values. The results indicate that flow separation at the <b>trailling</b> edge, and the interactions between the shock and the marginal region of separated flow beneath it, {{may be responsible for}} limiting the amplitude of the observed limit cycle oscillations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to provide information on the educational and employment status of 1976 - 1980 vocational program completers in Pennsylvania. Results were based on a 59 percent return (2, 669 persons) from selected area vocational-technical schools. The data were collected by mail from October 1982 to January 1983. Some of the findings were the following: (1) the unemployment rate for vocational completers was about one-fourth less than the rate for similar age group persons in the state in 1982; (2) about 25 percent of the completers are enrolled or have taken postsecondary training; about half of the. <b>trailling</b> was related to the secondary vocational field of study; (3) most completers were employed close to where they were trained; (4) more than three-fourths of completers employed in their field of training felt their high school vocational programs gave them good to excellent preparation for their current jobs; (5...|$|E

40|$|Inlet {{guide vanes}} (IGV) of high {{temperature}} gas turbines require an effective <b>trailling</b> edge cooling. But this cooling influences significantly the aerodynamic performance {{caused by the}} unavoidable thickening of trailing edge and the interference of the cooling flow with the main flow. Generally the blade trailing edge losses belong to the most importantpenalties for the overall turbine stage efficiency. They are functionof the trailing edge thickness and the base pressure and may amount to 30 % of the losses for cascades operating at transonic outlet Mach numbers. It is also known that the ejection of coolant flow from the trailing edge affects considerably the base pressure and thereby the trailing edge losses. Most investigations refer to coolant flow ejection through the trailing edge but the actual tendency seems to favour the ejection of the coolant from the pressure side {{just ahead of the}} trailing edge. The obvious advantage is the reduction of the trailing edge thickness. But this may be compensated by the modified pressure distribution resulting in a reduced lift of the blade...|$|E

5000|$|On 23 October, while {{returning}} from the mission upon which <b>Traill</b> scored his eighth victory, <b>Traill</b> collided with another plane in his flight while flying at 7,000 feet. The accident knocked away part of the Bristol F.2 Fighter's wing. As the fighter tried to spin out of control, Burbidge leaped out onto the opposite wing at <b>Traill's</b> command, to counterbalance the spin while <b>Traill</b> struggled for control. The resultant crashlanding hurled Burbidge onto his face, but left <b>Traill</b> uninjured and preserved the airplane. Both men were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this incident. <b>Traill's</b> citation read [...] An officer of marked skill and bravery, who has shot down three enemy machines and seriously damaged a fourth. On 23rd October his machine accidentally collided with one of ours at a height of 7,-000 feet, {{and a part of}} the left plane was carried away, the machine being thereby rendered out of control. With great presence of mind Captain <b>Traill</b> ordered his observer to climb out and so directed him to balance the machine which enabled him to obtain partial control.
