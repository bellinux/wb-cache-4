Another sortie followed on 23–24 October during which the German fleet did not encounter any British forces. Another uneventful advance into <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> took place on 21–22 April 1916. A bombardment mission followed two days later; Westfalen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Due to poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Mecklenburg {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. The squadron was initially allocated to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic {{in the direction of the}} Svenska Högarna islands. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the next day. From 5 December to 2 April 1915, Mecklenburg and the rest of the squadron were assigned to guard duty in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> based in the mouth of the Elbe.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Leipzig {{was assigned to the}} blocking force that was intended to prevent the escape of the Polish Navy from the Baltic; they were unsuccessful. Leipzig thereafter went to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> where she and the other light cruisers laid a series of defensive minefields. This task lasted {{through the end of the}} month, after which she returned to the Baltic for training maneuvers. On 1719 November, Leipzig covered a minelaying operation in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> She joined Deutschland, Köln, and three torpedo boats for a sweep in the Skagerrak for Allied shipping on 2122 November. Leipzig was tasked with escorting the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the Skagerrak, and with covering their return on the 27th.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II on 1 September 1939, Nürnberg {{was assigned to the}} blockade force that was intended to prevent the Polish Navy from escaping the Baltic. Despite the Germans' efforts, several Polish destroyers and submarines escaped to Britain, where they continued the war. On 3 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of the}} cruisers were withdrawn to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> to lay a series of defensive minefields to protect the German coastline. She returned to the Baltic for training exercises in October. The following month, she was transferred back to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> where she was tasked with escorting destroyers laying minefields off the British coast. On 46 December, the ship conducted a mining operation off Kristiansand, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having been}} forced to flee, Jachmann was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} rear admiral for his actions during the battle. The Prussians made several further patrols in the Baltic, but refused to seek a pitched engagement with the far superior Danish fleet. Instead, the Second Schleswig War was decided on land. Additionally, the arrival of an Austrian squadron in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> allowed the Austrians and Prussians to break the Danish blockade of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> coastal ports at the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May. The Austrians, fearing that a more aggressive operation to defeat the Danish fleet in the Baltic would provoke the British, kept their squadron in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> {{for the remainder of the}} war. On 9 May, the two sides signed an armistice in London that took effect three days later, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The Austrian and Prussian naval forces in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June. Ultimately, Denmark sued for peace after it became clear that they had lost naval superiority and that Britain would not intervene in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage. König was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a minesweeping unit in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> König conducted her last exercise in the Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter anchorages, capturing it intact. The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
