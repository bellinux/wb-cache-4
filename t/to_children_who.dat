As Ezaki Glico soon ran out of genuine Tenpō Tsūhō coins they started producing near identical fake Tenpō Tsūhō coins to meet the demand, these imitation Tenpō Tsūhō tend to have deeper cut characters on the coin’s reverse. These Glico-produced coins are worth more than genuine Tenpō Tsūhō because of their scarcity.|$|E

25|$|Injuries to the genital {{areas can}} be swelling, lacerations, and bruising. Common genital {{injuries}} are anal injury, labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior fourchette and fossa. Genital injuries are {{more prevalent in}} post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls. Internal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or {{it happened in the}} past after the injuries heal. Scarring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, {{eligibility}} for maternity allowances {{was extended to}} Aboriginal women who were exempted from State laws relating to the control of Aboriginal natives and who were considered suitable to receive the benefits. From 1943, the income test for maternity allowances was abolished {{and the rate of}} the allowance was increased to 15 pounds where there were no other {{children under the age of}} 14 years, 16 pounds where there were one or two other children, and 17 pounds 10 shillings in cases of three or more children. These amounts included an additional allowance of 25 shillings per week in respect of the period four weeks before and four weeks after the birth, to be paid after the birth of the child.

500|$|The castle {{declined}} once again, {{the courtroom}} became unsafe {{to use and}} [...] by 1833, the remaining judicial fittings had been stripped out. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century the Duchy of Cornwall rejected proposals to repair the castle in order to bring it back into service as being too expensive, but the castle site was enclosed to prevent injuries <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> might be tempted to play on the stonework. By the 1870s, the town of Lydford was vastly reduced in importance from the medieval period and the castle's roofs and floors had either collapsed or been removed.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the novel, Egoyan changed the setting from Upstate New York to British Columbia, to help secure Canadian funding. He also added {{references to the}} story of The Pied Piper of Hamelin by Robert Browning, to emphasize how Egoyan saw The Sweet Hereafter as a [...] "grim fairy tale." [...] Nicole is seen reading The Pied Piper <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> later die in the accident. In that story, the Pied Piper leads all the children away, never to return, after their parents refuse to honour their debt to him. Egoyan wrote a new stanza in the Pied Piper style for the scene in which Nicole testifies Dolores was speeding, in which she describes her father's lips as [...] "frozen as the winter moon." [...] Egoyan also made Mitchell Stephens the main character and increased the importance of Stephens' daughter, and moved the reveal of incest to later in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{first public}} {{mention of the}} Dorset Ooser was in an 1891 edition of Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries, where it {{was the subject of}} an article by the journal's editor, Charles Herbert May. The head was, at the time, in the {{possession}} of Thos Cave of Holt Farm in Melbury Osmond; the editor noted that it had been owned by Cave's family from [...] "time out of mind". Cave had stated that it had formerly been kept in an [...] "old malt-house" [...] in the village, [...] "where it was an object of terror <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> ventured to intrude upon the premises". May noted that it was [...] "possibly the only example now in existence, or at any rate from {{one of the very few}} which may still survive in the County", adding that Cave was [...] "willing to dispose of this mask to a lover of objects of antiquarian interest".|$|E

500|$|In Chinese literature, {{ailanthus}} {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing {{a father and a}} stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who,</b> like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
500|$|Sonny Bunch of The Washington Times said, [...] "The {{episode was}} both funny and smart, a wry {{commentary}} on the inherent trickiness of marketing a rebellious art form infused with sexuality <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have no business being sexually active themselves." [...] Tamar Anitai, a blogger for MTV, said the episode was [...] "hilarious". He said [...] "The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize, if not side with, the Jonas Brothers ... In the end, Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers." [...] Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, {{said he thought the}} Mickey Mouse character was used as an effective satirical device for corporate greed, but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because [...] "its targets — the Jonas Brothers, and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were so easy to hit". In contrast, Parents Television Council (PTC), criticized the episode for such elements, and they named this episode the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week".|$|E
500|$|The pace of Blue's Clues was deliberate, and its {{material}} was presented clearly. Similar to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which also inspired the producers, {{this was done}} was {{in the use of}} pauses that were [...] "long enough to give the youngest time to think, short enough for the oldest not to get bored." [...] The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem. After pausing, child voice-overs provided the answers so that they were given <b>to</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had not come up with the solution and helped encourage viewer participation. Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that the show was [...] "unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element." [...] In 2002, the success of Blue's Clues inspired the producers of Sesame Street to change its format and add more interactive segments. Blue's Clues also differed from Sesame Street by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers but, instead, made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children's attention. The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability.|$|E
