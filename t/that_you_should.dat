5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|Hence, the {{combination}} of object te with subject você in informal BP: eu te disse para você ir (I told you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go). In addition, in all the country, the imperative forms {{may also be the}} same as the formal second-person forms, but it is argued by some that it is the third-person singular indicative which doubles as the imperative: fala o que você fez instead of fale o que você fez ("say what you did").|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{was born}} into a cricketing family and his dad must take credit for his technique. He is {{actually}} a natural right-hander but his father felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have the stronger hand {{at the top of the}} handle and he switched him around. Rogers attended Brydon Country School and played in their 1st Eleven as an allrounder along with Sean Ervine. His secondary education was at St. John's College where he was captain of the first eleven.|$|E

25|$|Since I am anxious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{all know}} {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

500|$|Abercrombie never led another {{military}} campaign. Although he {{was active}} at Lake George, he did {{little more than}} provide support for John Bradstreet's successful attack on Fort Frontenac, which was authorized in a war council on July 13. Bradstreet left with 3,000 men on July 23, and Abercrombie then refused to engage in further offensive acts, alleging a shortage of manpower. William Pitt, the British Secretary of State who had designed the British military strategy and received word of the defeat in August, wrote to Abercrombie on September 18 that the [...] "King has judged proper <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> return to England."

500|$|In 2015, {{political}} historian Jenny Hocking {{revealed an}} exchange between Kerr and Prince Charles, who in 1975 was being mooted {{as a future}} Governor-General. In Kerr's private papers from September 1975, {{a month before the}} dismissal, Kerr had informed Prince Charles that he was considering dismissing Whitlam, and was concerned that his commission might be revoked by Whitlam to prevent it. According to Kerr, Charles had responded: [...] "But surely, Sir John, the Queen should not have to accept advice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be recalled at the very time when you were considering having to dismiss the government". This information was also shared with Buckingham Palace because the Queen's Private Secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, wrote to Kerr that should this [...] "contingency" [...] arise, the Queen would try to delay things for as long as possible.|$|E
500|$|Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Shining with Kubrick, {{notes that he}} [...] "always {{said that it was}} better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it.

When deciding on a subject for a film, {{there were a number of}} aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would [...] "appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film". According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly [...] "wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance". Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to [...] "enigmas and allegories" [...] and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.|$|E

500|$|Wiedemann and Lammers had {{provided}} assurances that Hess {{would not be}} harmed. In August 1940, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, issued {{a letter to the}} Düsseldorf Gestapo ordering that Hess should not be [...] "inopportuned in any way whatsoever". Noting that Hess had been [...] "both in the same company as the Führer and briefly the Führer's company commander", Himmler instructed that Hess should be granted [...] "relief and protection as per the Führer's wishes" [...] and asked that he be informed if Hess should leave Düsseldorf. A follow-up letter was sent by Lammers in November 1940, informing Hess that [...] "it is, however, the Führer's wish <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not be subject to any further restrictions because of your ancestry beyond those required by law." [...] Lammers expressly informed Hess that he was to use the letter for his protection: [...] "I give you this letter, if necessary, to make use [...] ".|$|E
500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was {{familiar}} with from {{his work at the}} Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, before stabbing and strangling Pesce to death and killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a reason <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> take me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E
