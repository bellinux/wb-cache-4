5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the government <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> story of a different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat {{was one of the}} Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
5|$|When Richter {{resigned}} {{as head of}} the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898, the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor. The appointment was not universally welcomed; the anti-Semitic press wondered if, as a non-German, Mahler would be capable of defending German music. Attendances rose sharply in Mahler's first season, but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re-scoring acknowledged masterpieces, and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar. An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed, because Richter was not interested. Mahler's position was weakened when, in 1900, he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle. The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money—Mahler had <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> orchestra's fare home from the Rothschilds. In April 1901, dogged by a recurrence of ill-health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra, Mahler relinquished the Philharmonic concerts conductorship. In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works, which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz, Wilhelm Kienzl and the Italian Lorenzo Perosi.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphoniumists were forced <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> literature of other instruments.

25|$|England's {{crushing}} defeat by France, {{the dominant}} naval power, in naval engagements {{culminating in the}} 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power.

25|$|The {{legend of}} the Lee Penny gave rise to Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman. The amulet was placed in water, which was then drunk to provide the cure. No money was ever taken for its use.

25|$|Potential loss on a {{short sale}} is {{theoretically}} unlimited, {{as there is no}} theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.|$|E

After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>the</b> cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years.

40|$|When {{a central}} bank {{implements}} the LOLR policy in a financial crisis, bank creditors often infer a bank's quality from {{whether or not it}} <b>borrows</b> from <b>the</b> central bank. We establish a formal model to study the optimal LOLR policy in the presence of this signaling effect, assuming that the central bank aims to encourage central bank <b>borrowing</b> <b>to</b> avoid inefficiencies caused by contagion. In our model, {{there are two types of}} banks: a high quality type with high expected asset returns and a low quality type with lower returns. Both types of banks need to roll over their short-term debts. A central bank offers to lend to both types of banks. After private creditors observe whether banks <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> central bank, banks try <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> private market. We find that there may exist a separating equilibrium where only low quality banks <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> central bank; and two pooling equilibria where both types of banks do and do not <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> central bank. Our major results are as follows: (1) Considering the signaling effect, the central bank should set its lending rate lower than the prevailing market rate to induce both types of banks <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> central bank. (2) Hiding the identity of banks <b>borrowing</b> from <b>the</b> central bank will encourage banks <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from <b>the</b> central bank. (3) The central bank may serve as a coordinator for the realization of its favored equilibrium...|$|R
