25|$|In Tulgao or Sumadel, {{you need}} to {{negotiate}} to find a local guide willing to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sugo-oc fumarole field. The trek from the village to the fumarole field is steep, difficult, at higher elevation, along carabao (water buffalo) tracks. As of 2008, tourists do not visit Sugo-oc and special arrangements need to be made. There is no western style accommodation in the villages of Tulgao or Sumadel, and no accommodation at all at Sugo-oc. There is a little used foot track from Sumadel to the plateau on the southern flank of Binuluan but requires some months of planning and negotiation and {{a high level of}} fitness.|$|E
500|$|According to Mudhoney vocalist Mark Arm, [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] {{originated}} from {{a discussion with}} Sub Pop owner Bruce Pavitt, who [...] "said: 'Hey, you sing about dogs. You sing about being sick. You got a shtick, it'll <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top.' And he basically gave us five chords, but he said don't use more than three within one song." [...] Arm also states that [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] was a catchphrase around which the band built a song.|$|E
500|$|A {{psychedelic}} rock version by the Misunderstood {{was recorded}} in 1966 and released as the B-side to the [...] "I Can <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun" [...] single on Fontana Records. [...] Author Dave Thompson writes, [...] "The Misunderstood pumped it up but kept it short, psychedelic sound effects, heart attack drums, [...] eerie harmonics". [...] Misunderstood guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell reworked [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] with his later band, Juicy Lucy, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970. [...] The song features Campbell's psychedlic steel guitar lines, which Thompson describes [...] "as fast and mean and dirty as any record could have been, a breakneck tour through the bayou swamps and dirt-track roads of the American South, powered by a guitar to make your fingers bleed".|$|E

500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus called [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{a little}} [...] "structurally {{ramshackle}} though never erratic, it's {{the type of}} massive album centrepiece that was inconceivable before The-Dream's stadium-R reinvented the genre as a mythological epic." [...] Paley Martin of Most Blunted stated that the track [...] "is {{so much more than}} a song; it is an audible baptism, a narrative delicacy, a self-indulgent experience! And you best believe once you press play, this ride will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1947, the Perkins {{family moved}} from Lake County, Tennessee, to Madison County, Tennessee. A new radio that ran on house current {{rather than a}} battery and the {{closeness}} to Memphis exposed Perkins to {{a greater variety of}} music. At age fourteen, using the I-IV-V chord progression common in country music of the day, he wrote a song that came to be known around Jackson as [...] "Let Me <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Movie, Magg" [...] (the song later persuaded Sam Phillips to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label).|$|E
2500|$|The Misunderstood is {{the only}} band that Peel ever {{personally}} managed—he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London.

[...] and shortly before his death, he stated, [...] "If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality that can get you on the ladder—though it still won't <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{methods of}} {{phishing}} use {{some form of}} technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear {{to belong to the}} spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> example section of the yourbank website; actually this URL points to the [...] "yourbank" [...] (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the [...] tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher. Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview feature.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
