5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's <b>technical</b> <b>manager,</b> {{developed}} an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E

[...] Brunner was educated at his father's school and then, {{at the age of}} 15, he decided to follow a career in commerce. [...] He spent four years in a shipping house in Liverpool, but found it neither exciting nor lucrative, and so decided on a change of career.

2500|$|The hybrid concept re-emerged {{early in}} 1942 when, {{in the face}} of {{mounting}} losses from U-boat attacks, it became apparent that escort carriers building in the US could not be delivered quickly enough in the numbers required.

Sir James Lithgow, Controller of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repair and joint-owner of Lithgows Ltd, the Clyde-based shipbuilders, also helped overcome Admiralty reservations about MACs. [...] Lithgow is said to have sketched a rough design for one on the back of an envelope and offered to convert two ships about to be built at his family's shipyard on condition that [...] "I am not interfered with by the Admiralty". While the timing of Lithgow's possibly apocryphal intervention is uncertain, his deputy, Sir Amos Ayre, the Director of Merchant Shipbuilding, was certainly discussing the requirements for MACs by May 1942.
