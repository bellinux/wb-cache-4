40|$|Details are {{presented}} of the fabrication {{and testing of}} five groups of twenty-four nominally identical double-lap single-bolt tension joints in pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite plate. All of the joints had the same nominal width (W) to hole to diameter (D) ratio, but {{each of the five}} groups had a different end distance (E) to diameter ratio. Each group of twenty-four joints was divided into four sub-groups of six joints, which were tested at four temperatures. Tensile loads and overall extensions at failure and failure modes were recorded for each joint test. The test data was used to produce graphs of mean and characteristic failure stresses, as well as approximate mean and characteristic failure strains. The former data were used in conjunction with mean and characteristic failure stresses of the virgin GFRP plate to provide <b>tensile</b> knock-down <b>factors</b> for the bolted joints for five joint geometries and four test temperatures.

40|$|Abstract - A {{tethered}} satellite system is {{proposed for the}} collection of a dust sample from the Martian atmosphere. In a previous paper, under the assumption of a circular orbit, a system had been designed by trading off the lowest reachable altitude versus the propellant consumption necessary to maintain a constant altitude orbit. Because of the dust density and distribution during a Martian storm, significant improvements in the mission scenario are achieved in the present paper by considering an elliptic orbit with dramatic reduction of propellant consumption with respect to our previous results. The system design is optimized in terms of tether diameter and orbital parameters with a simplex optimization algorithm that considers the propellant consumption as the cost function and the maximum in-plane libration and the tether <b>tensile</b> safety <b>factor</b> as constraints. The simulations of the system dynamics include an active feedback tether control for stabilizing the tether libration, which, for an elliptic orbit with low periapsis, can be significant. The analysis shows the potential of a tethered system for collecting a dust sample from the Martian atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of stone groundwood / polypropylene injection-molded composites was evaluated {{with and without}} coupling agent. Stone groundwood (SGW) is a fibrous material commonly prepared in a high yield process and mainly used for papermaking applications. In this work, the use of SGW fibers was explored as a reinforcing element of polypropylene (PP) composites. The surface charge density of the composite components was evaluated, {{as well as the}} fiber’s length and diameter inside the composite material. Two mixing extrusion processes were evaluated, and the use of a kinetic mixer, instead of an internal mixer, resulted in longer mean fiber lengths of the reinforcing fibers. On the other hand, the accessibility of surface hydroxyl groups of stone groundwood fibers was improved by treating the fibers with 5 % of sodium hydroxide, resulting in a noticeable increase of the tensile strength of the composites, for a similar percentage of coupling agent. A new parameter called Fiber <b>Tensile</b> Strength <b>Factor</b> is defined and used as a baseline for the comparison of the properties of the different composite materials. Finally the competitiveness of stone groundwood / polypropylene / polypropylene-co-maleic anhydride system, which compared favorably to sized glass-fiber / polypropylene GF/PP and glass-fiber / polypropylene / polypropylene-co-maleic anhydride composite formulations, was quantified by means of the fiber tensile strength facto...|$|R

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of fibers into a matrix over {{only a partial}} thickness of the beam is regarded as partially fiber reinforcing a beam.

A <b>tensile</b> strain enhancement <b>factor,</b> t, as determined by a direct tension test, forms a convenient engineering parameter that {{takes care of the}} influence of the aspect ratio and volume fraction of the given type of fiber.

40|$|This paper {{present a}} design {{approach}} {{to predict the}} shear capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates/rods applied according to the near surface mounted (NSM) technique. The new approach {{is based on the}} simplified modified compression field theory (SMCFT) and considers the relevant features of the interaction between NSM FRP systems and surrounding concrete, like debond and concrete fracture. In the SMCFT model, the shear strength of a RC element is a function of two parameters: the <b>tensile</b> stress <b>factor</b> in the cracked concrete (β), and the inclination of the diagonal compressive stress in the web of the section (θ). However, this approach is not a straightforward design methodology due to its iterative nature. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the relative importance of each input parameter that mostly affect the shear capacity of RC beams shear strengthened according to the NSM technique. Taking into account the obtained results, equations to determine β and θ without recurring to an iterative procedure are derived. The experimental results of 112 beams shear strengthened with NSM FRP are used to appraise the predictive performance of the developed approach. By evaluating the ratio between the experimental results and the analytical predictions, an average value of 1. 14 is obtained, with a coefficient of variation of 13. 1 %, being safe estimations 87 % of the predictions.

40|$|A {{study of}} the fatigue crack {{propagation}} behavior of single crystal nickel-base superalloy MAR-M 200 (Ni- 9 Cr- 10 Co- 12 W- 1 Nb- 2 Ti- 5 Al) was conducted {{in order to gain}} a detailed understanding of how fatigue cracks propagate along crystallographic planes. This included both the study of Stage I fatigue crack propagation using conventional compact-type (C-T) specimens and four-point loading specimens specially designed to achieve a pure cyclic shear condition. A two dimensional Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) method was used to calculate both the shear stress intensity factor (K(,l l)) and the <b>tensile</b> stress intensity <b>factor</b> (K(,l)) of C-T specimens with angled cracks as well as for pure shear specimens in four-point loading. ^ It was observed that crystallographic fatigue crack propagation occurred exclusively along octahedral (111) planes and was independent of the specimen crystallographic orientations. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that fatigue cracks propagate along crystallographic planes subject to pure cyclic shear loading. A shear component is necessary to propagate a crack and the crystallographic crack propagation is solely governed by the shear stress intensity factor (K(,l l)). The <b>tensile</b> stress intensity <b>factor</b> (K(,l)) does not provide any driving force for the crack propagation. ^ A basic crystallographic fatigue crack propagation mechanism, namely the cross-slip extrusion mechanism, has been identified in this study. It is observed that at least two slip systems receiving equal shear stress in the same crack plane are required in propagating the crystallographic fatigue crack in the absence of oxygen. Crack advance can be viewed as an intrusion process resulting from dislocation cross-slip using a primary slip system. The excess material accumulated {{as a result of the}} cross-slip process can either be extruded out toward the free surface or be transported using a secondary slip system. In addition to the above mechanism which operates in the absence of oxygen, a oxidation mechanism is responsible for crack advance using only one slip system when oxygen is present. The crack increment per loading cycle is the result of the oxidation of the freshly exposed surface ahead of the crack tip upon loading. The oxide break down at the crack tip due to dislocation pile-ups further enhances the irreversibility required in fatigue crack propagation. ...|$|R

Palm oil was converted to polyol by transesterification reaction with glycerol using calcium oxide as a catalyst.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unidirectional fiber-remforced {{composites}} {{exhibit a}} high degree of anisot-ropy in strength. Crack initiation from a pre-existing crack almost always occurs along the fiber direction; it is known as the splitting crack. One criterion for the splitting crack initi-ation under mixed mode condition is proposed. In this criterion, the splitting crack initia-tion is characterized by a unique interaction curve on the Kf&sigma;-Ktau plane, where Kf&sigma; and Kf&tau; are the tensile and shear stress intensity factors along the fiber direction. Fracture toughness tests under mixed mode loading are systematically carried out on two graphite-epoxy systems: AS 4 / 3501 - 6 and IM 7 / 85517. For both composites, the condi-tion of the splitting crack initiation can be characterized by a vertical line of Kf&sigma; = con-stant on the Kf&sigma;-Ktau plane. This means that the <b>tensile</b> stress intensity <b>factor</b> along the fiber direction is responsible for the splitting crack initiation. Furthermore, it is found that under the conditions of Kf&sigma; = 0 or Kf&sigma; < 0, damage occurs at locations away from the tip of the pre-existing crack before crack initiation and that the fracture toughness under such conditions is high...|$|R

40|$|The {{change of}} Young's modulus with {{increasing}} applied tensile strain {{in the open}} cell nickel and copper foams, fabricated by the slurry foaming process at Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, Japan, was investigated experimentally and analytically. Stress-strain curves were measured at room temperature, in which the loading-unloading-reloading process {{was performed on the}} sample at various applied strains. For measurement of the strain of the sample itself accurately, the non-contact extensometer was employed. The Young's modulus values at various applied tensile strains were estimated from the slope of the elastic region in the stress-strain curve in the unloading process. It was revealed that two competitive factors affect on the Young’ modulus value. One is the irreversible morphology-change of cells arising from the plastic deformation of the metal as a results of which, the cells are elongated and struts are straight forwarded in the <b>tensile</b> direction. This <b>factor</b> acts to raise the Young’s modulus with increasing applied strain. Another factor is the failure of struts, which tends to reduce the Young's modulus with increasing applied strain, especially beyond the strain where the struts are failed successively. Accordingly, due to the competition of the former and latter factors, the Young's modulus increases, reaching maximum and then decreases with increasing applied strain in both of the foams. The increase in Young's modulus with increasing applied strain due to the change of geometry of struts was confirmed by the experimental test of micro-samples composed of several struts and nodes and by the simulation based on the finite element analysis using a model micro-sample...|$|R

For the splitting test shape effect, no significant difference was found between CVC and SCC. Secondly, for the relationships between different tensile strength test methods, it was shown that a slight overestimation of the conversion factors is obtained using the model proposed in EC 2.

40|$|Two main {{objectives}} {{are included in}} this research. The first objective {{of this research is}} to develop constitutive material models for ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC). Since the unique behaviors of UHP-FRC under compression and tension, no existing material models can satisfactorily predict its behaviors subjected to various loadings. A three dimensional strain rate dependent plasticity model is proposed and developed to characterize the compressive behavior of UHP-FRC subjected to static and dynamic loadings. This proposed model is capable to capture the hardening and softening behavior of UHP-FRC and represents the material response under static and dynamic conditions. A three dimensional strain rate dependent fracture model based on smeared crack theory is proposed and developed to characterize the tension behavior of UHP-FRC subjected to static and dynamic loadings. This proposed model is able to capture the strain hardening and softening behavior of UHP-FRC under tension. The second objective is to understand the origin of strain rate sensitivity of UHP-FRC. Like the normal strength concrete, UHP-FRC exhibits strain rate sensitivity (higher strength achieved at higher strain rate loadings) when subjected to dynamic loadings. However, limited information about the origin of such strain rate dependency. Some researchers regarded the strain rate sensitivity as material inherent property while some suggested that the enhanced strength is due to the structural effect. Misinterpreting the structural effect as material effect will overestimate the material impact resistance and causes severer outcome. Two jobs are conducted to achieve this objective. First, employing pulse shaper technique to guarantee the validity of Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test. A parametric study of pulse shaper is conducted and suitable pulse shaper material and dimensions for testing of UHP-FRC is developed.
