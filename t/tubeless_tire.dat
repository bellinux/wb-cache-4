5000|$|<b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> are {{primarily}} used on mountain bikes {{due to their}} ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> work similarly to clinchers in that the bead of the tire is specifically designed to interlock into a corresponding tubeless rim, but without an inner tube. Air is inflated directly into the tire, and once [...] "locked" [...] into the rim, the system is airtight. Liquid sealants are often injected into <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> to prevent punctures. Pinch flats are impossible in a tubeless setup because there is no tube to pinch; however, air can escape if the bead lock is compromised from too much lateral force on the tire or deformation of the rim/tire due to hard impact with an object. Tubeless technology has progressed significantly over the last few years, and road-specific tubeless technologies for narrow tires are now gaining popularity.|$|R
5000|$|... 1978 Frank Herzegh - Goodrich {{inventor}} of the first successful <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> and owner of patents for over 100 inventions {{in the field of}} tire technology ...|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{designs of}} {{pneumatic}} tires required a separate inner tube which could fail {{for a number}} of reasons, such as incorrect tire fit, friction between the tire wall and inner tube generating excess heat, or a puncture. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety. In a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. If a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation. Conversely, an inner tube could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. However, the [...] "bursting like a balloon" [...] scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the inner tube is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size.|$|E
5000|$|Herzegh {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, {{receiving}} his bachelor's degree in Physics from Case School of Applied Science. He then joined the B. F. Goodrich Co. in Akron as a research and development engineer. In addition to the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> he also obtained over 100 other patents. After a 42-year career with Goodrich, he retired in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly common are <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> {{conforming}} to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) standard pioneered by French wheel manufacturer Mavic {{in conjunction with}} tire manufacturers Hutchinson and Michelin.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tubeless</b> bicycle <b>tire</b> system {{requires}} a compatible tire, an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire bead seat. The main benefit of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R
50|$|The {{globally}} certified {{safety features}} of this vehicle include crash protecting crumple zones, child lock, collapsible steering and side intrusion beams. Also, the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> voice assist system and remote locking / unlocking of the vehicle are the additional safety features.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, several dozen {{individuals}} and small businesses located mostly in southern Ontario experimented with snowblower innovation. One of these, Samuel McLaughlin of Oshawa, eventually {{became the basis for}} General Motors of Canada. S. L. C. Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick invented the sway bar, a device to improve the suspension of automobiles, in 1919. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney. In Montreal Alexis Nihon invented the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> system {{requires}} an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire bead seat — and a compatible tire.Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson for mountain bikes is the most common system of tubeless tires/rims for bicycles. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|E
50|$|The {{cross-section}} of a rim {{can have a}} wide range of geometry, each optimized for particular performance goals. Aerodynamics, mass and inertia, stiffness, durability, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> compatibility, brake compatibility, and cost are all considerations. If the part of the {{cross-section of}} the rim is hollow where the spokes attached, as in the Sprint rim pictured, it is described as box-section or double-wall to distinguish it from single-wall rims such as the Westwood rim pictured. The double wall can make the rim stiffer. Triple-wall rims have additional reinforcement inside the box-section.|$|E
50|$|A {{tire iron}} (also tire lever or tire spoon) is a {{specialized}} metal tool used {{in working with}} tires. Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift {{to the use of}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> in the late 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawbacks}} to <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> {{are that}} they are notorious for being harder to mount on the rim than clincher tires, and that the cyclist must still carry a spare tube to insert {{in case of a}} flat tire due to a puncture.|$|R
50|$|More recently, <b>tubeless</b> {{clincher}} <b>tires</b> {{have become}} popular after their successful presence on mountain bikes {{for the last}} several years. Advantages include lower overall wheel weight (no inner tube), lower tire pressures allowing for more traction without risk of a 'pinch flat' and no glue as required for tubular tires. It should be noted that not all clincher rim designs allow for <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> as an air tight contact surface is required to prevent the unintended loss of tire pressure.|$|R
50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim {{is similar to the}} hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|E

50|$|Tucker envisioned {{several other}} {{innovations}} that were later abandoned. Magnesium wheels, disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> and a direct-drive torque converter transmission were all evaluated or tested, but were {{dropped on the}} final prototype due to cost, engineering complexity, and lack of time to develop.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson {{introduced}} a tubeless system for road bicycles. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> {{have not yet}} gained popular acceptance in road racing {{due to lack of}} sponsorship, the tradition of using tubular tires and the fact that, even without the innertube, the combined weight of <b>tubeless</b> rims and <b>tires</b> is more than top-of-the-line tubular <b>tire</b> wheelsets. Road <b>tubeless</b> is gaining popularity among riders for whom the benefits are worth the costs.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{pneumatic}} tires {{which use}} a separate inner tube, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> have continuous ribs molded integrally into the bead of the tire {{so that they}} are forced by the pressure of the air inside the tire to seal with the flanges of the metal rim of the wheel.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{halogenated}} {{butyl rubber}} (halobutyl) was developed, in its chlorinated (chlorobutyl) and brominated (bromobutyl) variants, providing significantly higher curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. Halobutyl is today {{the most important}} material for the inner linings of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the cast wheels versus spoked are several, and {{include the use of}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> for higher speed and better retention of inflation; better runout tolerance and the elimination of spoke maintenance; better rigidity and thus better handling; weight reduction due to smaller hub size; and better handling of side loads for motorcycles with sidecar rigs.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile. The safety feature {{helps keep the}} tire bead held to the rim under adverse conditions by having a pair of safety humps extending inwardly of the rim toward the other tire bead seat from an outer contoured surface of the rim.|$|R
5000|$|Many patents {{had been}} filed {{covering}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b> Killen Tire {{applied for a}} patent in 1928 and was granted [...] in the UK in 1930. The Wingfoot Corporation, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire were granted a patent in South Africa in 1944. Due to technical problems, most of these designs only saw limited production or were abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|Tires {{also come}} with tubes, <b>tubeless</b> and tubeless-ready. <b>Tires</b> with tubes are the {{standard}} {{design and the}} easiest to use and maintain. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance. Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go tubeless. A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim. [...] Popular tire manufacturers include Wilderness Trail Bikes, Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson Specialized and Panaracer.|$|R
50|$|Second Series Volgas were {{introduced}} in 1959, with a new grille painted the body color or in chrome. Halfway through the 1959 production run (model year 1959½), a vinyl cover {{was added to the}} dash. Added were windscreen washers and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b> just Before the series concluded, telescopic shocks replaced the lever type. The 1961 Volgas were priced at 5,100 rubles.|$|R
50|$|Some {{off-road}} {{tires are}} designed to be used with low inflation pressure on difficult terrain, reducing their rigidity and allowing the tread to better conform to the terrain. Such a design may allow for use on a wider range of surfaces, but <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> running under rated pressure run the risk of breaking their bead. A beadlock can be used to prevent this.|$|R
50|$|The ComStar wheels {{combine the}} {{flexibility}} of spoked wheels with the strength and tubeless characteristics of one-piece wheels. Honda introduced the Com-Star wheels {{a year or so}} earlier on the CB250T/400T Dream {{as well as on the}} CB750F2 and GL1000 Gold Wing, although these featured standard rims that demanded inner tubes to be used. The CX500 was the first production motorcycle to use <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Butler {{was born}} in Denver, Colorado, to Winfred Girnt and Clarence Butler. His father was of English ancestry, while his mother was of German-English ancestry. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, and {{after graduating from high}} school in 1938, he became an {{aeronautical}} engineering major at Los Angeles City College. He was a co-inventor of the rapid repair of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> for which he held both U.S. and Canadian patents.|$|R
50|$|The Hunk has the 149 cc engine used in Honda Unicorn and Hero Honda CBZ X-treme, with Advanced Tumble-Flow {{induction}} Technology (ATFT) {{which the}} company claims will reduce emissions and fuel consumption. The new upgraded Hunk comes with semi-digital dashboard, ridged exhaust cover with front and rear disc brakes, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> and contoured visor. After recent cosmetic changes, the bike still retains its single-cylinder, air-cooled 149.2 cc engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve stem}} is a tube made of metal or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. Valve stems usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in valve stems eventually degrades, and, in the case of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> replacement of the valve stem at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their valve stem is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|R
