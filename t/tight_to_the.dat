25|$|Chan {{created his}} screen persona as a {{response}} to the late Bruce Lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death. Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it, since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E

2500|$|The Boxer is a {{short-haired}} breed, with a shiny, smooth {{coat that}} lies <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body.

[...] "Fawn" [...] denotes a range of color, the tones {{of which may be}} described variously as light tan or yellow, reddish tan, mahogany or stag/deer red, and dark honey-blonde. In the UK and Europe, fawn Boxers are typically rich in color and are often called [...] "red". [...] "Brindle" [...] refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background. Some brindle Boxers are so heavily striped that they give the appearance of [...] "reverse brindling", fawn stripes on a black body; these dogs are conventionally called [...] "reverse brindles", but that is actually a misnomer—they are still fawn dogs with black stripes. In addition, the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA blue-native gel {{electrophoresis}} system was {{combined with an}} in organello import assay <b>to</b> specifically analyse <b>the</b> location and assembly of two nuclear-encoded photosystem II (PSII) subunits. With this method {{we were able to}} show that initially the low molecular mass PsbW protein is not associated with the monomeric form of PSII. Instead a proportion of newly imported PsbW is directly assembled in dimeric PSII supercomplexes with very fast kinetics; its negatively charged N-terminal domain is essential for this process. The chlorophyll-binding PsbS protein, which is involved in energy dissipation, is first detected in the monomeric PSII subcomplexes, and only at later time points in the dimeric form of PSII. It seems <b>to</b> be bound <b>tighter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PSII core complex than to light harvesting complex II.
