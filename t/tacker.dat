40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{role and}} benefit of fibrin glue over <b>tackers</b> for mesh fixation in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Backgroud: Mesh fixation by <b>tackers</b> {{may lead to}} many complications peroperatively like bleeding, increased hospital stay and overall more cost and later on chronic groin pain. Material and Methods: 60 inguinal hernia with age more than 18 years were taken and were divided in two groups; 30 patient group who underwent TAPP and 30 patient group who underwent TEPP. In 15 patients in both groups <b>tackers</b> were used and in other half fibrin glue was used for fixation of mesh using a 3 mm catheter (Duplotip: Baxter Healthcare), which fits the Tisseel syringe. Results: The use of fibrin sealent has a distinct advantage in laparoscopic treatment of inguinal hernias compared with use of <b>tackers</b> {{as a method of}} mesh fixation. The use of fibrin sealant reduces the risk of post- and intraoperative complications, such as bleeding, seroma, chronic pain, has a lower incidence of postoperative neuralgia and provides an early faster return to social life. The recurrence rates do not vary much, but the operative time is slightly longer if the preparation time of the fibrin sealant is taken into consideration. In our study, we found a marginal difference in the cost of the two groups, fibrin sealant and stapled <b>tackers.</b> [Cukurova Med J 2015; 40 (3. 000) : 457 - 465...|$|R

40|$|Background Fixation of the {{prosthesis}} {{is one of}} the critical components of laparoscopic repair of ventral and incisional hernia (LRVIH). The impact of the Wxation technique used on operative time has never been analyzed. We compared the duration of the operation according to the Wxation technique used in a series of 138 patients with primary umbilical hernia. Methods All patients underwent a straightforward repair by using completely standardized techniques. One hundred and seven patients had mesh Wxation with a single crown of <b>tackers</b> (ProTack®, TycoUSS, Norwalk, CT) and eight transabdominal sutures (TAS). Thirty-one patients had mesh Wxation with a double crown of <b>tackers</b> (DC) without TAS. Results There were no signiWcant diVerences in age, sex, hospital stay, and morbidity between the two groups. Mean operating time for the technique with TAS was 50. 6 min compared to 41. 4 min for the DC technique. The mean diVerence in operating time was 9. 2 min. This diVerence was signiWcant (P = 0. 002). During a mean follow-up of 26. 4 months, there were no recurrences in the entire series. Conclusions The diVerence in operative times between the two operative techniques can be entirely accounted to the diVerence in the time needed for insertion of eight TAS as compared to the time needed for application of an inner crown of <b>tackers.</b> This strongly indicates that insertion of every single TAS prolongs LRVIH for approximately 1 min.

As the gentleman was not honourable enough to keep his engagement, he came again next day, with his pocket-book in such a state of distention that he was regarded in the bar as a man of large property. After that, he repeated his visits every day, and had so much writing to do, that he made nothing of emptying a capacious leaden inkstand in two sittings. Although he never talked much, still, by being there among the regular customers, he made their acquaintance, and in course of time became quite intimate with Mr <b>Tacker,</b> Mr Mould's foreman; and even with Mr Mould himself, who openly said he was a long-headed man, a dry one, a salt fish, a deep file, a rasper; and made him the subject of many other flattering encomiums.|$|E
