Manjoo explained: [...] "The {{problems}} is, {{when you try}} to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag <b>telling</b> <b>your</b> recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, [...] "From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com." [...] Manjoo further wrote that [...] "Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software". The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the [...] "On behalf of" [...] tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers.|$|E
