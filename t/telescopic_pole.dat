5000|$|An {{automated}} pool cleaner is {{a vacuum}} cleaner intended to collect debris and sediment from swimming pools with minimal human intervention. Popularly dubbed a creepy-crawly or [...] "Kreepy Krauly" [...] in South Africa, {{it is one of}} several types of swimming pool vacuum cleaners. Other major types are battery-powered or manually powered wands effective only for very small pools, kiddie or wading pools and small spas and hot tubs, and battery-powered, handheld/extended reach pool and spa vacuums. The latter are powered by rechargeable batteries and can be hand held attached to a <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> used for extended reach. These are used for small to medium-sized pools, larger spas, and to spot clean larger pools. The name creepy-crawly derives from the vacuum's webbed-nozzle crawling creepily through the underwater mist as well as for its creepy suction noise. Creepy crawly originally referred to strange creatures that crawl {{on the bottom of the}} ocean, as the webbed nozzle of the vacuum slightly resembles an octopus in both appearance and suction ability.|$|E
40|$|This study {{measured}} {{the accuracy of}} two radiotracking techniques: (1) triangulation using a Yagi antenna and (2) a form of direct location, the extended-reach technique, which uses a small loop antenna attached to a lightweight 9 -m <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole.</b> The {{study was conducted in}} the Cotter River, an upland stream in the Australian Capital Territory. Radio tags were positioned instream to determine whether depth, substrate, or local bank profile affected radiotracking accuracy. The extended-reach technique was more accurate (mean error 6 SE 젱. 00 6 0. 21 m) than triangulation (2. 57 6 0. 21 m). Decreased accuracy resulted from the triangulation of radio tags positioned close to boulders or in water more than 1 m deep. These variables had no effect on the accuracy of the extended-reach technique. The presence or absence of a steep rocky bank did not affect the accuracy of either radio-tracking method. The increased accuracy of the extended-reach technique provides an improvement over traditional methods for studying the small-scale movement and microhabitat use of crayfishes (e. g., Eustacus spp.) and benthic fishes in upland streams.

Indeed, this work contributes to the enrichment of this topic by providing a new pollination device to date palm growers. This pollinator consists of a powdering device mounted on a <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole.</b> Field tests of this pollinator were conducted in Touggourt and Biskra (Algeria).

The cost of the device was less than the cost of pollinating about 25 palm trees by the traditional method. Moreover, pollination by this device required half the time which was necessary by the traditional method of pollination. With this device, the safety of the farmer is assured since he doesn’t have to climb the palm tree anymore which is also very important. The promising research results obtained testing the developed pollination device makes this pollinator an alternative option for farmers in economic, security and time savings terms.

40|$|The {{presence}} of vegetation in stream ecosystems is highly dynamic in both space and time. A digital photography technique is developed to map aquatic vegetation cover at species level, {{which has a}} very high spatial and a flexible temporal resolution. A digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera mounted on a handheld <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> is used. The low-altitude (5  m) orthogonal aerial images have a low spectral resolution (red-green-blue), high spatial resolution (∼ 1. 9  pixels cm− 2, ∼ 1. 3  cm length) and flexible temporal resolution (monthly). The method is successfully applied in two lowland rivers to quantify four key properties of vegetated rivers: vegetation cover, patch size distribution, biomass and hydraulic resistance. The main advantages are that the method is (i) suitable for continuous and discontinuous vegetation covers, (ii) of very high spatial and flexible temporal resolution, (iii) relatively fast compared to conventional ground survey methods, (iv) non-destructive and (v) relatively cheap and easy to use, and (vi) the software is widely available and similar open source alternatives exist.

Previous research has left a number of problems open and the proposed solutions cannot be considered yet fully satisfactory. In the first part of the article we will outline the limits of the current standards of archaeological documentation and describe the possibility of integration of these new tools into the operational practices, with particular emphasis on photogrammetry. In the second part we will propose an example of archaeological analysis of the Nuraghe of Tanca Manna (Nuoro) using unconventional methods and tools: a system of shooting on <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> (featuring remote control of the camera to the ground and preview frame); the combined use of free cloud computing and commercial software for automatic modeling of architectural surfaces; a dedicated electronic procedure to document the wall stratigraphy and the shape of the structural elements on the 3 D model; data management in a GIS environment; the use of PDF 3 D as standard format for the exchange and use of three-dimensional content.

The water is filtered by either a two-stage or three-stage filtration process, involving a carbon filter, and two de-ionization filters, or a carbon filter, a reverse osmosis membrane filter, and a de-ionization resin filter. The filtered water contains a TDS (total dissolved solids) of less than 5 ppm. (parts per million.) The brush is used to agitate the debris off the window, while spraying water, and then the brush is lifted a few inches from the glass to rinse the glass with the pure water jets. Fan jets are used for hydrophobic glass, and [...] "pencil" [...] jets are used for hydrophilic glass. The de-ionized water is lacking in ions, so it will pull solids off the glass and dissolve the solids into the water, aiding in the cleaning process. Because there are no solids dissolved in the water, the windows dry clear without water spots. Water-fed poles vary in length. The longest poles are about 70 feet, and can reach up to six storeys. Water-fed cleaning is also referred to as pure water cleaning. It is common in the UK and becoming common in the US.|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} for UK and world cities are often taken at local airports. These are usually {{on the outskirts}} of the urban areas and so not subject to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Hence they are not representative of urban and city area temperatures. As most buildings are built in urban and city areas, designers need to know these temperatures. It is therefore very important to study the UHI effect and adjust the weather data used for design to include the UHI effect. This paper emanates from a project to measure the UHI effect in Greater Manchester, UK. With the advent of miniature temperature sensors and data loggers a simpler and cheaper shield was designed and produced. This paper describes the construction and testing of a new, low cost radiation shield that can accommodate a new, low cost combined miniature temperature sensor and data logger. The shield and data loggers are both tested and shown to give very reliable results. Practical application: The low cost, easily fabricated radiation shield with its miniature sensor—logger was designed to measure the dry bulb air temperature in Greater Manchester to investigate the UHI effect. The shield is designed to be mounted, with two stainless steel bands, on a lamppost column, typically at 4 m height. A <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> can be used to unhook the sensor—logger for data collection.

40|$|The work {{described}} herein {{took place}} during 2014 (June 23 to September 30) to investigate the removal efficiency of solids, the settling of solids, and the hydraulics (flow pattern, velocity) within a conventional stormwater pond located in John Avant Park, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The stormwater pond in John Avant Park has a total contributing catchment area of 114. 62 ha, from three inlets, one outlet, a man-made aeration stream, and an aeration fountain. Programmable ISCO 6700 series automated stormwater samplers equipped with ISCO 750 acoustic Doppler area velocity flow modules were installed in the inlet and outlet manholes to measure the water level and velocity. Stormwater samples were collected within 24 hours for concentration and particle size distribution analysis, following each of 14 rain events {{that occurred during the}} measurement period. A hand corer and a water depth to sediment surfaces measurement apparatus (<b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> with foot) were used to investigate spatial variances in the particle size distribution and accumulation of settled solids. A robotic total station and a three dimensional prism were used to track drogues to investigate pond hydraulics. For comparison, camera equipment was used and calibration points were surveyed to evaluate the movement of drogues using concepts from large scale particle tracking velocimetry (LSPTV) along with visual observations. In total, 82 mm of rainfall was recorded over the field season, resulting in an inflow to the pond of approximately 66, 517 m 3, as measured from the inlets. The total outflow from the pond was approximately 154, 150 m 3, where 86, 943 m 3 of the outflow was not accounted for as inflow measured in the inlets. It was found that the stormwater pond had a total solids removal efficiency of - 67 %, indicating a higher concentration of solids were leaving the pond than entering. Solids sampled from the pond’s outflow had a higher concentration of finer particles than the inflow, suggesting the pond was more effective at removing larger particle sizes. From the negative removal efficiency and the higher concentration of finer particles in the outflow, it was determined that resuspension of finer grained solids (clay, silt size) potentially occurs. From 51 sediment depth measurements taken throughout the pond it was estimated that the pond is accumulating approximately 1 cm of solids per year, based on when the pond went into service in the late 1980 s. It was found that over the summer season, from June 24 to August 25, the spatial distribution of sediment thickness slightly differed. The thickness of core samples varied from approximately 10 cm to just over 30 cm, where the clay liner of the pond was captured in some cores and not others such that the cores themselves could not be used to indicate depth. Core samples were predominately comprised of sand, with coarser particles (sand, gravel) located closer to the inlets and the periphery. Finer particles (silt, clay) were more predominant further away from the inlets. Drogue tracking was performed on five different occasions throughout the field season to evaluate pond hydraulics (flow pattern, velocities) using surveying with a robotic total station, concepts from Large Scale Particle Tracking Velocimetry (LSPTV), and visual observations. The flow path and velocity of drogues were found to be predominately related to the wind speed and direction. Results from this field investigation suggest that short-circuiting could occur when the wind direction is from the inlets to the outlet during rain events or baseflow conditions as drogues were seen to travel in this direction under those conditions...|$|E

40|$|The great barn at Harmondsworth near London Heathrow airport, United Kingdom (UK), {{was built}} in 1426 – 7 for the Bishop of Winchester. At 58 metres long and 11. 4 metres wide, {{it is one of}} the largest ever known to have been built in the UK, and the largest intact medieval timber-framed barn in England. The barn is built almost entirely of oak, {{although}} the walls rest on a low masonry sill-wall. Internally the space is divided into a central "nave" with a lower aisle to each side, and is divided along its length into 12 bays. There are three doorways on the east side. For an entirely timber-framed barn, the fabric is exceptionally well preserved. Even the external weatherboarding may be partly original. Following years of neglect, however, there are a number of on-going structural and conservation problems, so in 2011 the barn was bought by English Heritage in order to allow these needs to be addressed. English Heritage is the government agency responsible for the historic sites and buildings in the care of the state of England and is also the UK government's lead advisor on the built heritage. As one of the first steps in the conservation process the English Heritage Geospatial Imaging and Imaging & Visualisation teams undertook a four-day campaign of survey data collection. This took the form of laser scanning of the interior and exterior of the barn plus the acquisition of photography of the exterior elevations to be used with structure from motion (SFM) software. A comparison of the results of these complimentary yet potentially competing technologies will be given, as well as an evaluation of when they can be successfully used together. This paper will describe the procedures and problems involved with collecting the survey data and its subsequent analysis. The laser scanning was undertaken using a FARO Focus 3 D phase based instrument. Approximately 60 scans were acquired in order to provide as comprehensive as possible coverage given the site circumstances. A repeat visit following the clearance of artefacts and with the benefit of access equipment was required to obtain complete coverage, especially for the top surfaces of the timber frame elements. Initial results from the laser scanning were extremely promising, with some historical events (e. g. a major fire at one end of the structure) dramatically shown in the intensity data. Comprehensive photographic coverage of the exterior of the barn including the roof was obtained using a Nikon D 3 X mounted on both a 6 m <b>telescopic</b> <b>pole</b> and a conventional tripod. A repeat visit was required to address some exposure problems in shadow areas. A unified control network for both sets of data was obtained through the use of a total station theodolite (TST) with reflectorless electromagnetic distance measurement (REDM), incorporating a closed traverse as well as the acquisition of scanner and photogrammetric targets. The control network therefore permits the direct comparison of the results from both survey methods (allowing for systematic errors). A point cloud generated from the photography, using Agisoft Photoscan structure from motion software, was compared with the registered laser scan points with a view to determining any systematic differences, although these were to a large extent ameliorated by the use of the dense control network. The resultant data also has potential downstream use within English Heritage for improving our understanding of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as applied to heritage structures rather than new build, and thereby contributing to the formulation of elements of a BIM strategy for English Heritage. There are also a number of hand-measured survey drawings of the barn in existence. A quantitative as well as a qualitative comparison was made with drawings generated from the laser scan data. In general the later drawings were more metrically accurate but exhibited less understanding of the construction techniques employed. A discussion of the reasons for this is also presented...|$|E
