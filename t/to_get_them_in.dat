5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
25|$|During {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{with the}} decline in {{interest}} in arcade games, Funspot started deaccessioning its games. Once the museum was founded, Funspot began looking to regain those games they lost. One such lost game was the first video game to appear in Funspot, Tank II. It was installed around 1977 and sold off in the late 1980s. Another copy was acquired by the museum, {{but it is not the}} original game that used to be housed at Funspot. To reaccession games, the museum purchases some on eBay and has many donated. Often, nonworking or partial games are donated, and restoration work, sometimes years' worth, must be done <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> working order.|$|E
25|$|Three {{films were}} based on the {{original}} Broadway play. The first, a silent film also called The Bat, was produced and directed by Roland West, who co-wrote the screenplay with Julien Josephson and George Marion Jr. Cornelia was played by Emily Fitzroy, and Eddie Gribbon was the Bat. West's wife, Jewel Carmen, played Dale Ogden as her last film role. West made the actors work at night <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood for the thriller. The film was released by United Artists on March 14, 1926. The year before, West had directed an adaptation of one of The Bat imitators, The Monster. Critics considered The Bat to be an improvement over that previous film; it received positive reviews and did well at the box office. The film was considered lost for decades, but a print was discovered in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Clouzot {{was very}} {{demanding}} with his actors and would often quarrel with them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, [...] "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm {{not about to}} complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E
500|$|When Selman returned, Scully scolded him {{and told}} him that he had to {{apologize}} to the mayor of East St. Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore. Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?" [...] Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw [...] "all the other writers laughing". [...] "I was so relieved", he said, [...] "I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|As an {{international}} cast was employed, actors performed {{in their native}} languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English. The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with synchronized sound. Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone's music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, {{it would have been}} difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.|$|E

2500|$|... in 1999, Bright {{received}} a tip about a bluegrass act who was performing {{at a bar}} called [...] "The Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar" [...] in Nashville's Printer's Alley. The group consisted of Gary Vernon (stage name [...] "Gary LeVox"), Joe Don Rooney and Jay DeMarcus. After hearing them perform, Bright was impressed by their vocal blend and invited {{them to come to}} his office where they sang for him a cappella. [...] Bright signed them to a recording, publishing, and management contract, and promptly took them into the studio to record three songs. At that time the band did not have a name; so, during a performance they asked their bar patrons to suggest one. A man came up at their intermission and suggested [...] "Rascal Flatts", saying that he once had a band by that name in high school. They liked the name, and bought the rights to it on the spot for five thousand dollars using funds from their signing bonus. The agreement was written on a napkin. Bright auditioned the group for executives of Disney's Lyric Street Records who agreed on a recording contract, but Bright retained total creative control. It was a risky proposition at first, because all of the band's salaries, expenses, equipment, and pre-existing tour obligations had to be paid by Bright and his new company. [...] Bright's employees took the band members to the gym regularly <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> better physical shape. Bright worked incredible hours and told his wife, [...] "If this flops, we'll have to sell the house". [...] The band, Rascal Flatts, became an enormous success, their first seven albums were all certified platinum or higher in record sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2009, [...] they had sold 18.6 million albums. When the band learned that the Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar would be closing to make room for a new hotel, they returned to the honky tonk for a final concert in November of 2014. Band member Gary LeVox said, [...] "This stage got us on stages around the world. We're forever indebted." ...|$|E
