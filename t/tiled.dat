5|$|The {{floor of}} the atrium of the Molecular and Chemical Sciences Building at the University of Western Australia is <b>tiled</b> with Penrose tiles.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or <b>tiled</b> roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. <b>Tiled</b> eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{building material}} is white Lias Limestone, sometimes incorporating red sandstone or conglomerate, with red clay <b>tiled</b> roofs. Buildings, particularly the churches, date back hundreds of years, for example those at Marksbury and Compton Martin, the latter incorporating a columbarium.|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Farm House is on {{the south}} side of the road near the Star Inn. It is a timber framed and cruck-built (A-frame) <b>tiled</b> roof {{building}} with a lobby entrance, previously a farmhouse, originally built around 1600. The south end dates to the 18th century.The <b>tiled</b> roof, with four small gabled dormers, half-hipped at the north west angle, was restored in the late 20th century. It became a Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. Holt Cottage is a small thatched cottage situated on the edge of the village and was built in 1503. A Grade II listed building since 31 May 1985, much of the current building dates to the 17th and early 19th centuries. The roof is half-hipped at the south end and hipped at the north, with painted brickwork in monk bond.|$|E
5|$|Pub – The White Horse in {{the village}} centre is a popular pub across the island. It {{suffered}} a fire in 1987, then again 20 years later in 2007 which saw its temporary closure. Prior to the two fires, the pub was thatched, however after the fire in 2007, a <b>tiled</b> roof was built, {{in an attempt to}} prevent future fires.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house and}} the chapel are built of the local Blue Lias stone. Parts of the house have mellow honey-coloured Hamstone dressings, {{especially}} around windows and at quoins; the later 18th century additions have brick dressings. The roofs are stone <b>tiled</b> with some later terracotta tiles.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the royal}} family's private dining room. The {{decoration}} continues the theme {{used in some}} of the more formal and public rooms, with <b>tiled</b> panels illustrating courtiers in sylvan poses. These panels, like much other work in the palace, were produced by João Valentim and José Conrado Rosa.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} to Centaur was unveiled at Point Danger, Coolangatta, Queensland on 14 May 1993, the 50th {{anniversary of the}} sinking. It consists of a monumental stone topped with a cairn, surrounded by a <b>tiled</b> moat with memorial plaques explaining the commemoration. The memorial {{is surrounded by a}} park with a boardwalk, overlooking the sea, with plaques for other Merchant Navy and Royal Australian Navy vessels lost during World War II. The unveiling of the memorial was performed by Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator John Faulkner.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work {{commenced}} in February 1954 {{on a new}} pier on the new waterfront {{designed in}} a modern utilitarian style. The structure {{was described as a}} U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of <b>tiled</b> reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream <b>tiled</b> walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with <b>tiled</b> or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of <b>tiled</b> roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the capital}} Halab {{has not been}} excavated, the {{architecture}} of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, <b>tiled</b> floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes {{on the walls of the}} palaces in Alalakh.|$|E
5|$|The 17th century Yarn Market is {{a market}} cross which was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The <b>tiled</b> roof provides shelter from the rain. The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at the top was rung to indicate the start of trading.|$|E
5|$|The Apple House, a small red-brick {{building}} {{to the west of}} the stables quadrangle, also dates from around 1636, and can be seen in a painting of Crewe Hall from around 1710. Originally a dovecote, it is used as a storehouse. Built on an octagonal plan with two storeys, it has two oval windows with stone surrounds. The lower entrance has a stone semicircular arch; a second doorway is located at first-floor height. The pyramidal <b>tiled</b> roof is topped by a glazed lantern with a lead cap. The building is listed at grade II.|$|E
5|$|The Sala das Mangas (the only room in {{the state}} apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with <b>tiled</b> wall panels (illustrated below). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, {{all of which have}} been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{opened for}} {{business as a}} hotel on January 15, 2015. It {{is the first of}} what was planned to be twenty Virgin Hotels locations that operate under this business model. The renovation took longer than planned due to the building's city landmark status, which required continuing coordination with the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. Original features that were retained include a 1920s oak cigar bar, brass elevator lobby doors and a <b>tiled</b> ceiling. The final layout of 250 rooms includes 40 single-room suites and 2 penthouse suites. 40 rooms are pet friendly.|$|E
5|$|The canons {{built an}} {{octagonal}} dovecote {{a short distance}} {{to the west of}} the west range. The dovecote is extant, though it cannot be visited and is not part of the priory grounds. Built in the 14th century, it was modified in the mid-18th century with the addition of a pyramidal roof <b>tiled</b> with Welsh slate and capped with an open-sided timber cupola. The original nesting boxes have been removed and the dovecote is used as a garden store.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} chapel (Ohel) at the Jewish {{burial ground}} is Grade II-listed. Designed in 1893 by Lainson and Son and {{built by the}} Garrett building firm, it is a red-brick octagonal structure in the Queen Anne style, with a <b>tiled</b> turreted roof and corbel-topped piers at each corner, a pedimented entrance and arched windows set below recessed panels. The burial ground is surrounded by walls, stucco-faced gate piers and wrought iron fences which are listed separately at Grade II.|$|E
5|$|The {{church and}} {{infirmary}} have almost entirely vanished, but the site boasts {{some of the}} finest and best-preserved monks' living quarters still surviving in southern England. The buildings round the cloister are still roofed and habitable and many of the rooms retain their vaults. Among the most important preserved rooms are the chapter house, the refectory with its magnificent arch braced wooden vault and the painted chamber. Much of the abbey's medieval <b>tiled</b> flooring remains. Other major survivals include the abbey gatehouse, which still provides entrance to the visitor, the moat and fishponds. Cleeve is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The market cross was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family {{who were the}} local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. It still bears the damage caused by cannon fire in the Civil War. Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved to the outskirts of the village. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The <b>tiled</b> roof provides shelter from the rain.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. The building itself consists of stone walls, a <b>tiled</b> roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest part is the chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. The house itself has a timber frame with a <b>tiled</b> roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low pitched roof and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E
5|$|The rectory is a Grade II listed {{building}} and stands opposite the village pond. A building of several periods, the rectory was first {{built in the}} 17th century although includes 18th and 19th century additions. The building consists of two storeys with an exposed timber-framed core, with taller attachments at the south. A <b>tiled</b> roof is hipped {{at the north end}} and its walls consist of red brick with Flemish Bond. A K6 telephone box beside the village pond is also Grade II listed. The telephone box was designed in 1935 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and was made by various contractors.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} <b>tiled,</b> and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{original}} building are hidden by the modern extensions up {{to the level of}} the first floor. The gables are weatherboarded above the plain wall with double casement windows opening into the attic. The rear has a prominent late 18th century extension covered by the catslide roof. The rest of the rear of the building is a series of flat-roofed extensions. The roof is steeply pitched, <b>tiled</b> and half-hipped with over-hanging eaves Kent peg tiles, and weatherboarded gables. Forged brackets support the guttering.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a <b>tiled</b> roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E
5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red <b>tiled</b> roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with <b>tiled</b> roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is {{at the front of}} the house, and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been left in place. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, <b>tiled</b> with Cornish slate.|$|E
5|$|The IND {{side of the}} station, the {{southern}} side, was completed in 1984, when it was named the Construction Achievement Project of the Year by the Metropolitan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers; however, it did not open for passenger service until October 29, 1989, due to delays {{in the construction of}} the multi-level 63rd Street Tunnel, caused by the financial crisis of the 1970s. Upon the station's opening, it operated as a typical one-track, one-side platform station on each level, with only the IND side in use, while the BMT side of each level was hidden beyond an orange <b>tiled</b> false wall. Switches on both levels connected the lines to the west of the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{consciousness}} accelerated until in the 1840s {{two academic}} groups, the Oxford Society and the Cambridge Camden Society both pronounced {{that the only}} suitable style in which to design a church was Gothic. The critic John Ruskin was an ardent advocate of all things medieval and popularised these ideas. The architect Augustus Welby Pugin, who designed mainly for the growing Roman Catholic Church, set himself to recreate not only the structural appearance of medieval churches, but also the richly decorated and colourful interiors that had been almost entirely lost, existing only as a painted screen here and there, a few <b>tiled</b> floors such as those at Winchester and Canterbury and the intricate painted wooden ceiling of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens to}} music {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its <b>tiled</b> maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's sabre with {{the push of}} the joystick's fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles too long in the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs {{dug into the}} sides of {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with <b>tiled</b> roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|The roof is <b>tiled</b> and hipped, {{with five}} hips in all. The seven window {{openings}} {{built into the}} roof at second-floor level are original, but fitted with modern windows. On the first floor there are nine tall, narrow windows with wide frames, stone sills and deep arches of rubbed brick. In the late 18th century, eight windows were altered, {{two of which are}} on the left-hand-side of the door. The door itself is placed centrally with a coved, moulded architrave above and 45-degree corbels decorated with acanthus supporting a cornice with round brackets and a carved keystone. The door is glazed and a Doric porch of modern brick covers the doorcase.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is <b>tiled</b> with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome <b>tiled</b> floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the <b>tiled</b> floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
