5000|$|A <b>trigender</b> {{person may}} shift from one gender to another {{depending}} on the individual's mood or situation.|$|E
50|$|Regardless {{of current}} gender, <b>trigender</b> people's sexual {{orientation}} stays the same, as sexual orientation and gender {{are associated with}} independent neural mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|Trigenderism is {{considered}} rare; presently, {{there is no}} cohesive community in which <b>trigender</b> individuals can share information, nor {{has there been a}} perceived need to study or address specific issues associated with trigenderism. For the most part, <b>trigender</b> people find their accommodations and needs the same as bigender people. As transgender children have started to get more media attention in the 1990s and 2000s, studies have tried to further understand transgender issues. Some university LGBTQ groups and alliances are increasingly finding their communities more gender fluid as well and less oriented towards traditional labels such as [...] "gay", [...] "bisexual", and [...] "straight". The American Psychological Association and the University of California, San Franscisco both recognize bigender as a subset of the transgender community. In the UK, [...] "polygender" [...] is a common term found on transgender websites, forums, and support groups, {{as well as at the}} Scottish Transgender Alliance.|$|E
50|$|Some Star Trek plots {{introduce}} {{species that}} have sex, gender, or sexual identities {{outside of the}} gender binary and cisnormativity associated with humans. Agendered, monogendered, bigendered, <b>trigendered,</b> and pangendered species, each with unique or uncommon sexual reproductive methods, have been portrayed as having distinctly non-human assignment of reproductive responsibilities.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{describes}} {{the efforts of}} fictional computer animators to create a [...] "compu-drama" [...] from the second section of Asimov's novel The Gods Themselves, which occurs in a parallel universe with different laws of physics to that within which Earth is situated, amongst a <b>trigendered</b> species of energy-based beings and one triad of narrative protagonists in particular. The story attributes this middle portion to an author named Gregory Laborian, saying it is a stand-alone novel entitled Three in One. Laborian convinces director Jonas Willard, who had won fame for a CGI version of King Lear, to create an animated version of Laborian's story.|$|R
5000|$|Pangender is a non-binary gender {{defined as}} being more than one gender. A {{pangender}} person may consider themselves a member of all genders. The prefix pan is Greek and means [...] "all." [...] Pangender {{is a kind of}} third gender, much like bigender, <b>trigender,</b> or genderqueer. Pangender individuals may identify with gender inclusive or gender neutral pronouns instead of gendered ones (such as she/he or her/him).|$|E
50|$|Androgynous (also androgyne) is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} descriptive term for people in this category. However, not all persons identify as androgynous. Genderqueer people may identify as either having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; having two or more genders (being bigender, <b>trigender,</b> or pangender); having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); or being third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes {{those who do not}} place a name to their gender.|$|E
5000|$|Gender is {{somewhat}} difficult to measure, {{leading to the}} common belief that sex and gender are the same. Research by Diamond, Milton and Dick Swaab, shows that patterns in gender behavior, thoughts, and feelings can be identified in the brain. <b>Trigender</b> individuals, much like bigender individuals, often {{feel the need to}} [...] "present" [...] themselves as the gender they feel like at the given time. Some days, they may present themselves as members of their birth-assigned sex by wearing clothing associated with that gender, and on others will attempt to pass as a cisgender member of the opposite sex, either to reduce gender dysphoria or simply to be perceived socially as the opposite sex. Sometimes, they will express themselves androgynously to avoid having to deal with complications of living as more than one gender. Some gender bend by consistently expressing more than one gender at a time. Bigender and <b>trigender</b> people must undergo the process of learning to live as female and male culturally if they choose to express other genders. The May 2010 issue of Scientific American Mind focused entirely on the social and biological constructs of gender expression and included a small, four-page article on how studying transsexuals can bring greater insight into this field of study. The learning process of male and female cultural roles includes learning how to walk, talk, interact verbally and non-verbally, think, and behave.|$|E
50|$|Trigenderism is a non-binary gender {{identity}} {{in which one}} shifts between or among the behaviors of three genders, which could include male, female, and third gender (or genderless, non-gender, polygender, or any other variety of genderqueer identities). Someone who is also gender fluid may mix two or more genders at a time. <b>Trigender</b> falls under the general category of genderqueer or androgyny, a {{gender identity}} {{that goes beyond the}} normal binary gender system (male and female) and tends to be a catch-all place for other gender identities. It can also be seen as the equivalent cultures that recognize individuals to define their own sense of self.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout Hindu and Vedic texts {{there are}} many {{descriptions}} of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender. There are several instances in ancient Indian epic poetry of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories of depicting love between same sexes especially among kings and queens. Kamasutra, the ancient Indian treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes. Transsexuals are also venerated e.g. Lord Vishnu as Mohini and Lord Shiva as Ardhanarishwara (which means half woman). Homosexuality was never viewed as a crime, on the contrary, alternative sexuality formed an inalienable part of society. Apart from male and female, {{there are more than}} 20 types of genders, such as transwoman, transmen, androgynous, pangender and <b>trigender</b> etc. and in ancient India it was referred to as Trithiya prakirthi ...|$|E
40|$|MORE ON THE ORIGIN OF INDO-EUROPEAN INFLECTED SYSTEM Summary As {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of Afro-Asiatic languages show, the primary Afr. -A. vocalism may be represented as an opposition а — ə, - a and -ø being allophons in ultima. Therefore the fact that according to V. Ivanoff — E. Pulleyblank the primary I. — E. opposition may be reinterpre­ted as а — ə, enables us to suppose it's universality in all West-Borealic dialects. So the I. —E. vo­calism in ultima may be also identified as -a‖-ø — ə— cf. e. g. Hittite datives-locatives with zero inflection and with -a. It seems possible, that in C-stems' endings the zero variant was genera­lized, while in a -stems it was the a -variant. In this way the thematic suffix -a may have arised. The gender system which preceded the I. — E. <b>trigender</b> system was like that of Afr. -A. type, part of the former common gender having been turned into “masculinum”, the other part as well as the former neutral (non neutrum!) gender having formed an “intermediate” gender (genus Σ). I. — E. sg. fern. = pl. neutr. were mostly nomina abstracta derivated from the “intermediate” gender stems by adding H 2 (а /ə stem ending +H 2 = ā, or ø stem ending +H. 2) (see table). It is possible that Proto-I. — E. derivations with ā having been descended from the primary *a/ət 2 > *а/əН г, like Afr. -A. -ā<-ah < -at, t being a common Borealic formative pointing to passivity and abstraction...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we cover}} those gender forms which fall outside the common binary {{of women and}} men. However, as we will see, {{bisecting}} the world into women and men – or, indeed, women, men, and others – {{is not necessarily a}} useful way of conceptualising things. Consequently, we have entitled this chapter ‘Further Genders’ in order to be comprehensible to readers who are unfamiliar with gender forms other than woman or man (whether trans or cisgender). Another commonly used umbrella term, which we use throughout the chapter, is non-binary. Broadly speaking, this includes people who: •	have no gender (e. g. gender neutral, non-gendered, genderless, agender, neuter, neutrois); •	incorporate aspects of both man and woman (e. g. mixed gender, sometimes pangender, androgynous); •	are to some extent, but not completely, one gender (e. g. demi man/boy, demi woman/girl); •	are of a specific additional gender (either between man and woman or otherwise additional to those genders, e. g. third gender, other gender, sometimes pangender); •	move between genders (e. g. bigender, gender fluid, sometimes pangender); •	move between multiple genders (e. g. <b>trigender,</b> sometimes pangender); •	disrupt the gender binary of women and men (e. g. genderqueer, genderfuck). As we will see, many people’s realities, whether they use this terminology or not, are something outside the strict categories of man (e. g. always wears blue, is aggressive, smokes a pipe) and woman (e. g. always wears pink, is passive, does knitting). Therefore, this chapter considers both those who explicitly identify outside the gender binary and those whose experience may be regarded as to some extent non-binary. Another point to consider here is that the terms above may well be unfamiliar to many readers precisely because this remains such an under-researched area (and, indeed, an under-represented area in wider Western culture). As we will see, the vast majority of psychological research and theory has assumed that gender is binary – often to the point of searching for differences between (two) genders. Relatively little work has challenged the categories of women and men, although there has been a fair amount of theory in some areas of other disciplines (such as Sociology, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, and Trans Studies) questioning the gender binary: most notably queer theory. We touch upon this during the chapter while focusing upon the burgeoning body of knowledge within psychology. Of course, when we refer to ‘psychology’ here we are speaking of a minority Western model of psychology which has historically not engaged fully with global identities and experiences. Consequently, while this chapter endeavours to be broader in scope, it necessarily reflects this bias in its reporting of the literature. ...|$|E
