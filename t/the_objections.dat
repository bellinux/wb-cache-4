40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a charge that is often made against consequentialist moral theories: that they are unacceptably demanding. This is called <b>the</b> Overdemandingness <b>Objection.</b> <b>The</b> paper first distinguishes three interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>Objection</b> as based on the three {{dimensions}} of moral demands: scope, content, and authority. It is then argued that neither the scope, nor the content-based understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Objection</b> is viable. Constraining the scope of consequentialism is neither helpful, nor justified, hence the pervasiveness of consequentialism cannot be the ground for <b>the</b> <b>Objection.</b> Although recent approaches interpret <b>the</b> <b>Objection</b> as a claim about the excessively demanding content of consequentialism, {{it is argued that}} the stringency of consequentialism is also unproblematic insofar as demandingness is concerned. These results show {{that the only way to}} put <b>the</b> <b>Objection</b> is by focusing on the inescapability of consequentialism. <b>The</b> <b>Objection</b> thus takes <b>the</b> following form: consequentialism is overdemanding because it requires us, with decisive force, to do things that we do not have decisive reason to perform. However, in the last part of the paper it is shown that defending this interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Objection</b> is at best an open-ended and perilous enterprise. The paper concludes that the case for authority is weak: although this is the only defensible way to advocate <b>the</b> <b>Objection,</b> its successful defence depends on the truth of further substantial philosophical positions...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> input <b>objection</b> to {{reflective}} equilibrium (RE) {{claims that}} the method fails {{as a method of}} moral justification. According to <b>the</b> <b>objection,</b> considered moral judgments (CMJs) are not truth-conducive. Because the method uses inputs that are not credible, the method does not generate justified moral beliefs. <b>The</b> <b>objection</b> is solved by reinterpreting RE using contemporary developments in ethical intuitionism. The first half of the thesis sets up <b>the</b> input <b>objection,</b> explores potential responses to <b>the</b> <b>objection,</b> and uncovers <b>the</b> best way to solve <b>the</b> <b>objection.</b> <b>The</b> second half of the thesis solves <b>the</b> input <b>objection</b> by defining key terms, detailing the revised RE procedure, reinserting the notion of a competent moral judge into the method, using intuitionist criteria for identifying genuine moral intuitions, creating three filters capable of sorting good from bad CMJs, and showing how it is possible to assign evidential weight to CMJs {{so that they can be}} used as standards against which moral principles can be measured and a justified moral theory realized...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{begins with}} a {{detailed}} discussion of <b>the</b> Overdemandingness <b>Objection</b> to consequentialism.

After this, the paper goes on to offer three – so far in the literature unpursued – responses to <b>the</b> <b>Objection.</b> <b>The</b> first puts forward a constitutive role of instutions in determining and, in face of <b>the</b> <b>Objection,</b> lowering <b>the</b> demands of consequentialism; the second argues that consequentialism does not give us decisive reasons to act; the third doubts that the intuition that consequentialist requirements lack decisive force, does in fact exists...|$|R

50|$|Unable to {{overturn}} the Commission's decisions, many Democrats instead tried to obstruct them. Congressman Abram Hewitt, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made a spurious challenge to the electoral votes from Vermont, even though Hayes had clearly carried the state. The two houses then separated to consider <b>the</b> <b>objection.</b> <b>The</b> Senate quickly voted to overrule <b>the</b> <b>objection,</b> but <b>the</b> Democrats conducted a filibuster in the House of Representatives. In a stormy session that began on March 1, 1877, the House debated <b>the</b> <b>objection</b> for about twelve hours before overruling it. Immediately, another spurious objection was raised, this time to the electoral votes from Wisconsin. Again, the Senate voted to overrule <b>the</b> <b>objection,</b> while a filibuster was conducted in the House. However, the Speaker of the House, Democrat Samuel J. Randall, refused to entertain dilatory motions. Eventually, the filibusterers gave up, allowing the House to reject <b>the</b> <b>objection</b> in <b>the</b> early hours of March 2. The House and Senate then reassembled to complete the count of the electoral votes. At 4:10 AM on March 2, Senator Ferry announced that Hayes and Wheeler had been elected to the presidency and vice presidency, by an electoral margin of 185-184.|$|R
