5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. <b>The</b> <b>builder</b> of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E

5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this common design. A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> produced many unique designs.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{many of the}} attractions have been removed, {{including}} the monorail {{at the end of}} 2002. However the resort still retains several swimming pools and a funfair. Today it provides a range of activities such as rock climbing, fencing, and archery. It also provides a wide range of entertainment, aided by the formation of strategic partnerships with popular brands, including The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent, Thomas & Friends, , Guinness World Records, Bob <b>the</b> <b>Builder,</b> Pingu and Angelina Ballerina.|$|E
50|$|The Goodies' {{office is}} being renovated, but <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> {{are taking a}} very long time to finish their work.

The office is extremely noisy because a recording of construction work is being played to make it appear that the men are working.|$|R
50|$|One {{common thread}} between {{all the books}} in the series is the {{exploration}} {{of one or more}} Builder artifacts. Each exploration reveals new and previously unknown facts about <b>the</b> <b>Builders</b> and leads <b>the</b> characters to speculate about the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Builders</b> and their current whereabouts. Each book ends with a very different conclusion based upon the newly discovered evidence. It would appear from the Foreword to Convergence by Sheffield that even he couldn't decide what <b>the</b> <b>Builders</b> should be.|$|R

5|$|The art {{historian}} Hans J. Böker claims that Foliot began {{the construction of}} the Bishop's Chapel at Hereford Cathedral. Böker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit Robert of Hereford, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} scheduled for completion in April 1945, but construction was expedited after the defeat at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the IJN {{anticipated that the}} United States would now be able to bomb Japan with long-range aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands. <b>The</b> <b>builder</b> was unable {{to increase the number}} of workers on Shinano and could not meet the new deadline of October. Even so, the pressure to finish as quickly as possible led to poor workmanship by the workforce.|$|E
5|$|Zacharie's death {{threatened}} {{to disrupt the}} project, but King Louis XVI of France was personally interested, and Zacharie's oldest son, Guillaume, was allowed to resume the work. On 14 December 1771, new letters patent were given to Guillaume and his partners, replacing the earlier ones. Under the new terms, all the land needed could be expropriated including two toises, or , of land on either side for tow paths. <b>The</b> <b>builder</b> could take materials wherever they could be found.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or {{simply because of the}} preference of <b>the</b> <b>builder.</b> A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually the home of the local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Holden died on 1 May 1960. His {{body was}} cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were {{spread in the}} garden of the Friends' Meeting House in Hertford. On 2 June 1960 a {{memorial}} service was held at St Pancras New Church, where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers The Manchester Guardian, The Times and The Daily Telegraph and in construction industry periodicals including <b>The</b> <b>Builder,</b> Architectural Review, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Journal of the Town Planning Institute. Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works. The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the alien}} empires have decided to {{surrender}} to <b>the</b> <b>Builders.</b> Captain America managed to make himself heard by the Galactic Council and planned a retaliation against <b>the</b> <b>Builders</b> {{which resulted in the}} successful liberation of the Avengers who were being held captive and the destruction of numerous forces of <b>the</b> <b>Builders,</b> partially turning <b>the</b> tide of the battle. After the Inhumans deny a tribute to Corvus Glaive, Thanos appears on Attilan to meet with Black Bolt. Black Bolt attacks Thanos with his hypersonic voice.|$|R
25|$|As {{construction}} progressed, <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> {{needed more}} and more materials to complete the boat. Coincidentally, {{in the summer of}} 1841 Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy arrived on the Columbia as part of the United States Exploring Expedition. While inland, he learned of the construction of the ship and the plans of <b>the</b> <b>builders.</b> Wilkes then impressed upon McLoughlin to change his position regarding the sale of supplies to <b>the</b> <b>builders,</b> including an offer to pay for any supplies the Americans were unable to buy. With this, McLoughlin then allowed <b>the</b> ship <b>builders</b> to buy <b>the</b> remaining items needed, namely canvas and rigging.|$|R
50|$|Phages {{are found}} in and around many Builder artifacts. Whether {{or not they are}} {{actually}} constructs of <b>the</b> <b>Builders</b> is sometimes disputed, but the general consensus is that the phages were constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Builders,</b> but only because they are associated with so many Builder artifacts.|$|R
5|$|In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature {{authorized}} Scott {{to commission}} superintendents and surveyors {{to survey the}} lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, James Wilkinson, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the Kentucky River, although <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> apparently laid only the cornerstone. Scott first visited Kentucky in mid-1785. Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; he had returned to his farm in Virginia by September 1785.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly {{expanding}} economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included St Andrew's and St George's West Church, George Street, in the New Town of Edinburgh, designed by Andrew Frazer (1782–87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle Corinthian portico and a tall steeple. <b>The</b> <b>builder,</b> Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.|$|E
5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates, the gun mountings, and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but <b>the</b> <b>builder</b> somehow lost track of this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E
