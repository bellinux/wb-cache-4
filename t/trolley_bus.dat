5|$|The Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (RTA) {{operates}} public bus {{routes in}} the Dayton metro area. In addition to routes covered by traditional diesel-powered buses, RTA {{has a number}} of electric <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> routes. The Dayton trolleybus system is the second longest-running of the six remaining trolleybus systems in the U.S., having entered service in 1933. It is the present manifestation of an electric transit service that has operated continuously in Dayton since 1888.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vehicle was}} a <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> donated from the Municipal Tramways Trust in 1958 with others soon following. The museum opened as a static display in 1967. Workshops were built {{to enable the}} {{restoration}} of the old trams to operating condition. ICI, then operator of the salt lagoons, donated land for the tramway to run next to St Kilda Road. The tramway opened for trials in 1973 and was officially opened in 1974 by Harry Bowey, mayor of Salisbury, and Frank Kneebone, Minister for Lands, to coincide with St Kilda's centenary. In 2001 a large additional museum building was completed to house the increasing number of donated trams.|$|E
25|$|Having {{formed a}} {{favourable}} opinion of trolley buses, the Board {{decided to use}} them on a new line to Richmond. However, it realised that its troubles with Inter City Motors on the North Beach route would soon be resolved and given the vehicles that would become available, {{an extension of the}} <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> system would not be needed. An attempt to cancel the order failed, so the second <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> line was opened in 1934 to Marshland Road via Richmond. This enabled trams to be withdrawn from the remaining portion of the North Beach tramline, which followed the same route as the new Richmond <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> line.|$|E

25|$|The main {{forms of}} {{transport}} within Donetsk are: trams, electric trolley buses, buses and marshrutkas (private minibuses). The city's public transport system {{is controlled by}} the united Dongorpastrans municipal company. The city has 12 tram lines (~130km), 17 <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> lines (~188km), and about 115 bus lines. Both the tram and <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> systems in the city are served by 2 depots each. Another method of transport within the city is taxicab service, of which there are 32 in Donetsk.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Board took {{delivery}} of a Ransomes <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> in 1931, they conducted trials with it on the Hills portion of the Cashmere route. The objective was to determine how trolley buses would perform on such terrain, though not intending to actually convert the route to <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> operation. The following year, buses temporarily replaced trams on this route during the tramway strike {{because of concerns about}} the replacement motormen the Board had taken on to operate the trams were not sufficiently skilled to safely operate a tram on the Hills section, and those supporting the strike had taken to sabotage to disrupt tram operation on the Hills section. Tram services were again temporarily replaced with buses during a power supply crisis from June to August 1947.|$|E
25|$|The ETS {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} well over 960 buses across the city with 180 regular routes. Edmonton {{was one of two}} cities in Canada (the other is Vancouver) that operated a <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> system until service was discontinued in May 2009. The ETS also {{operates a}} specialized system for disabled people called DATS (Disabled Adult Transit System).|$|E
50|$|On March 31, 2014, the STM began {{testing a}} Chinese BYD {{prototype}} all-electric bus on several routes {{with a plan}} to have Novabus of St. Eustache, Quebec begin to trial its own version later the same year. The earlier plan to incorporate <b>trolley</b> <b>busses</b> using overhead wires was put on hold for further study.|$|R
50|$|Also in {{the city}} has a bus service. Major bus routes pass through the main {{streets of the city}} and most of them repeat {{trolleybus}} routes, but are inferior in frequency to <b>trolleys.</b> <b>Bus</b> transportation is provided by Sterlitamak Passenger Motor Transportation Enterprise (GUP Bashavtotrans). These are comfortable buses, with a lowered stance, a Bashkir brand NEFAZ.|$|R

25|$|It quickly {{proved to}} be a useful {{addition}} to the fleet. The first, and only, English Electric <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> in service at the time for the Shirley route, opened on 1 April 1931, had to be temporarily withdrawn after a month for upgrades to its bodywork, during which time no. 213 was able to provide relief cover. It was also used for experiments on the Cashmere Hills tram route to test performance on steep terrain. On the morning of 24 May 1931 and the afternoon of 1 June 1931 no. 213 was run along the Cashmere tramline to Dyers Pass Road with one pole on the overhead tram wire and towing a contact line attached to a skate on the tram rail. Though the Board was satisfied with the results, it ultimately decided against conversion of the Cashmere tram route to <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> operation.|$|E
25|$|With the 1900s {{industrialization}} of Hungary, Kecskemét developed {{public transportation}} by trams for {{a population of}} 50,000. Not until after World War II did bus travel begin in the city. In 2010, with competitive funding from the EU, the city launched a number of <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> lines and in 2011 completely rebuilt the downtown as a trolleybus and pedestrian tourist zone.|$|E
25|$|The inflexibility of the <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> {{system and}} a desire to {{standardise}} on diesel buses led to the decision to withdraw the trolley buses in the 1950s. The short working to Shirley was discontinued on 16 July 1951 with the remaining services to Marshland Road via Richmond closing on 31 May 1956 and to North Beach on 8 November 1956.|$|E

25|$|Trackless trolley (<b>trolley</b> <b>bus)</b> {{service was}} {{suspended}} in 2003 and the 110 AM General vehicles that had provided service on SEPTA's five trackless trolley routes {{never returned to}} service. However, in early 2006 SEPTA ordered 38 new low-floor trackless trolleys from New Flyer, which entered service in 2008, restoring trackless service on routes 59, 66 and 75. These buses replaced SEPTA Neoplan EZs, ending Neoplan's 26-year domination.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major problem}} was the {{shorting}} of electrical systems and premature failures in the car's motors and propulsion systems. Boeing used an advanced chopper control system for the cars as insisted by the federal government. While such systems have been implemented successfully in many subway, light rail and <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> systems, the systems installed in Boeing's cars {{were found to be}} overly-complicated for the transit systems' use.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the city}} of Vancouver, buses {{generally}} run on a grid system, with most <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> routes operating radially out of downtown and along north–south arteries, and most diesel buses providing east–west crosstown service, with the University of British Columbia (UBC) as their western terminus. Outside {{the city of}} Vancouver, most buses operate on a hub-and-spoke system along feeder routes that connect with SkyTrain, SeaBus, West Coast Express, or other regional centres.|$|E
25|$|Designed {{in their}} native England to operate in cities with a <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> network, the Tilling-Stevens buses {{employed}} an electric motor to provide motive power. The vehicles were fitted with trolley poles and where available, trolley overhead lines {{would be used to}} provide power to the electric motors. The vehicle could also operate away from a trolley network by using its petrol engine to run a generator that powered the electric motors.|$|E
25|$|Though the English firm of Ransomes, Sims, and Jefferies had {{not been}} {{successful}} in its bid for the supply of vehicles for the first <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> service in Christchurch, they had built a vehicle of the type they had intended to supply to Christchurch and offered it to the Board to evaluate, free of charge, for a year. It arrived at Lyttelton, ready for use, on 21 April 1931 and was numbered 213.|$|E

25|$|Electric trolley buses {{operate on}} major routes {{in the city}} of Vancouver, with one route {{extending}} to neighbouring Burnaby. Most <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> routes operate in a north–south direction. Trolley buses receive electricity from a network of overhead wires. In the fall of 2006, TransLink introduced a new generation of electric trolley buses, replacing the old models built in the early 1980s. The new trolley buses have low floors and are fully wheelchair accessible.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial of no. 213, the Board decided to purchase the vehicle. When trams were withdrawn from the remainder of the North Beach tramline in 1934, it was decided that that route also would be converted to <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> operation, for which it was decided to go with an additional four Ransomes trolley buses. Ransomes supplied the chassis and running gear and the bodies were constructed in the Board's own workshops to a slightly different design than that of no. 213.|$|E
25|$|Many archaeological digs have {{occurred}} {{in and around the}} town. Between 1971 and 1973 this was mainly concerned with tracing the course of the town's ramparts and during this period much ironstone tumble was found, and the existence of a wattle pallisade was confirmed. When the buildings around the <b>trolley</b> <b>bus</b> terminal were demolished in 1974 the site was excavated. The remains of mediaeval buildings, cesspits and latrines were discovered, including a wall and a flagstone entrance. A number of mediaeval arrowheads were also found.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Union Square {{is served}} by many <b>trolley</b> and <b>bus</b> lines and the F Market {{heritage}} streetcar.
