5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E
5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too complicated. The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Several {{setbacks}} {{plagued the}} design process. The mine {{in particular was}} delayed several times from its expected completion from 1771 to 1776. Piloting Turtle, moreover, required great physical stamina and coordination. The operator would have to adjust the bilge {{in order to keep}} from sinking while providing his own propulsion by use of a crank, which worked a propeller located {{on the front of the}} submarine, and direction by use of a lever that would operate and direct a rudder in the back. The cabin also reportedly held air for only thirty minutes of use. Thereafter, the operator would have to surface and replenish the air through a ventilator. Obviously, training would be needed in order to ensure the project's success due to <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of the machine. “The boat was moved from Ezra’s farm on the Westbrook Road to what is now Ayer’s Point in Old Saybrook on the Connecticut River,” writes historian Lincoln Diamant. Bushnell had a Yale connection here that allowed him to run trials in secrecy. Bushnell did the initial testing of his submarine here, choosing his brother, Ezra, as the pilot. Despite Bushnell's insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a Loyalist spy working for New York Congressman James Duane.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E

25|$|In general, a {{heat sink}} {{performance}} {{is a function of}} material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, heat transfer coefficient, air flow rate, and duct size.

Due to <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can also be used.

For Gramsci, <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of modern civil society means that a 'war of position', carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of proletarian culture, and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a 'war of manoeuvre' – a direct revolution – {{in order to have a}} successful revolution without a danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of the tone determined by how often a vortex encountered the hole while moving at some speed u less than the initial jet speed. Since the jet slowed as it proceeded toward the hole, {{the speed of the}} vortex slowed with it so the frequency and Strouhal number was greater at closer spacing. The Strouhal number data showed clearly the almost linear relation between frequency and initial jet speed. The number would be more constant if the actual jet speed at the hole could have been used as the characteristic speed. In four of the distances tested, there were jumps between Stage I and Stage II. The hysteresis loops are clear indications of <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of the jet instability gain structure.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} because of <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> {{of the matrix}} (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E
25|$|The Moscow group {{tended to}} support the leftist {{side of the debate}} on how to destroy {{religion}} (i.e. in favour of attacking religion in all of its forms rather than moderation), and in 1924 it attacked Yaroslavsky, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich for differentiation between different religions, instead of genuine godlessness. It accused Yaroslavsky of attacking only the clergy rather than religion in general. Yaroslavsky protested this and affirmed that all religions were enemies of socialism including the Renovationist schism in the Orthodox church, but that the methods of struggle against different religions should vary due to the large number of loyal Soviet citizens with religious beliefs who should be re-educated as atheists rather than treated as class enemies. Bezbozhnik argued that it was an oversimplification to treat religion solely as a kind of class exploitation to be attacked, forgetting <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>nature</b> of religions, as well as the individual believers. The CPSU Central Committee supported Yaroslavsky's viewpoint on this issue, although this debate remained unresolved at the Union that came in 1925.|$|E
