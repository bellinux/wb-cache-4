5|$|The Syrian Army {{was meant}} to consist of two brigade-sized units, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare them, thus only the 1st Brigade {{was in a state}} of {{readiness}} by May 15. It had about 2,000 soldiers in two infantry battalions, one armored battalion, and 4–6 artillery batteries.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers {{was the key to}} the survival of his own task force.|$|E

5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on the launch pad. During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} Kennedy Space Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> roll Challenger back from the pad; {{the decision was made to}} secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
5|$|In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, {{the head}} of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new {{experimental}} Army Ranger unit. McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, to serve as the company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> administer physical fitness tests for the applicants, and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay.|$|E
5|$|In the two {{previous}} days, 9. Panzerdivision had seen little action. It crossed the Meuse early {{on the morning of}} 11 May, but that day was unable to advance quickly over roads congested with the supply trains of the infantry divisions. The armoured division was under orders to link up with the airborne troops as soon as the Peel-Raam Position had been breached by the infantry forces. As the entire Dutch front had dissolved, the conditions were favourable for such an attempt. In this it would not be hindered by the French forces. Because the German 6th Army was threatening its right flank and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare a defence line, Gamelin ordered the 7th Army to withdraw its left flank. 2e Brigade Légère Mécanique, part of 1e Division Légère Mécanique, which had arrived at Tilburg, retreated to the south. Also, the 25e Division d'Infanterie Motorisée at Breda progressed no further to the north than the river Mark. As the initial order to occupy the Geertruidenberg sector had not been followed upon, the route to the Moerdijk bridges would not be blocked and the German armoured division would not be engaged by its stronger French mechanised counterpart. Reconnaissance elements of the 9th Panzer Division effectively exploited this opportunity: at dawn, north of Tilburg, near Loon op Zand, they surprised Colonel Schmidt and took him prisoner. Dutch troops in the province thereby lost all unified command. Shortly after noon German armoured cars had penetrated thirty kilometres further to the west and made contact with the southern Moerdijk bridgehead, cutting off Fortress Holland from the Allied main force; at 16:45 they reached the bridges themselves. The northern part of that force would not long remain in the region: at 13:35 Gamelin ordered a complete withdrawal to Antwerp of all French troops in North-Brabant, who would now limit themselves to rear-guard actions.|$|E

5|$|Seward was an expansionist, {{and sought}} {{opportunities}} to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) {{as a financial}} liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, {{only to be told}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.|$|E

Two new aircraft were built to this specification and the two existing S.6s were upgraded and renamed S.6A.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, both Chinese and Westerners {{would place}} more {{faith in a}} small, motley group of mercenaries than readily {{available}} local citizenry, because the average Chinese of the time had little understanding of marksmanship, nor much impetus to defend the Manchu throne.

25|$|The defenders' {{position}} on Kos, never enviable, soon became serious and, presently, desperate, for the Italian anti-aircraft defence was negligible {{and their own}} resources meagre. To add to their troubles, the area round the airfield they had to protect was too rocky to permit digging in, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> build blast walls before the enemy was upon them. The air attacks were so severe that casualties inflicted on the British paratroopers forced them to be withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E

Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E

Realizing that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> throw out the grenade, he tucked it in to his stomach and turning away from his comrades, absorbed {{the full impact of}} the blast, sacrificing his life to save his fellow {{soldiers}} from certain death.|$|E
25|$|Such was {{the lack}} of warning that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> engage in {{defensive}} manoeuvres, leading to a change in British policy whereby any Royal Navy vessel that suspected it might be under missile attack would turn toward the threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent a ship being caught defenceless again.
