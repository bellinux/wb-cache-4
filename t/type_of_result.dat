2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>result.</b> This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} to incomplete markets was first conjectured by Andreu Mas-Colell in 1986. To do this he remarks that Walras' law and Homogeneity of degree zero {{can be understood}} as the fact that the excess demand only depends on the budget set itself. Hence, homogeneity is only saying that excess demand is the same if the budget sets are the same. This formulation extends to incomplete markets. So does Walras law if seen as budget feasibility of excess-demand function. The first incomplete markets Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>result</b> was obtained by Jean-Marc Bottazzi and Thorsten Hens (1996). Other works expanded the type of assets beyond the popular real assets structures like Chiappori and Ekland (1999). All such results are local.|$|E
50|$|From First Fortran (1957) onwards, {{separate}} {{compilation of}} portions {{of a program}} has been possible, supporting the creation of libraries of procedures and functions. A procedure in the source file being compiled that invokes a function from such an outside collection must know the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>result</b> returned by the unknown function, if only to generate code that looks {{in the right place}} to find the result. Originally, when there were only integers and floating-point variables, the choice could be left to the rules for implicit declaration, but with the proliferation of sizes and also types the invoking procedure will need a type declaration for the function. This is not special, having the same form as for a variable declared inside the procedure.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{programming}} languages {{that have}} this feature may allow or require a complete type declaration for each procedural parameter f, including {{the number and}} type of its arguments, {{and the type of}} its result, if any. For example, in the C programming language the example above could be written as int P ( [...] int f (int a, int b) [...] ) { return f(6,3) * f(2,1); }In principle, the actual function actf that is passed as argument when P is called must be type-compatible with the declared type of the procedure parameter f. This usually means that actf and f must return the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>result,</b> must have the same number of arguments, and corresponding arguments must have the same type. The names of the arguments need not be the same, however, as shown by the plus and quot examples above. However, some programming languages may me more restrictive or more liberal in this regard.|$|E

The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>result</b> studies the number of path components of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics modulo diffeomorphism for compact spin manifolds that are even dimensional, whenever this space is non-empty.
