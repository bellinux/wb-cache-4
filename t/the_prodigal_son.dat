5|$|The Gates of Hell {{comprised}} 186 {{figures in}} its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Maltings {{gave the}} festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten {{conducted}} the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970. Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten; he was himself the dedicatee of <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son.</b> Two other Russian musicians who {{were close to}} Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his cello suites, Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival.|$|E

He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son.</b> However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> – which {{at the time of their}} original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E
50|$|After Erwin Nyhoff, {{the only}} {{original}} member left in <b>the</b> Swedish band <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Sons,</b> {{decided to go}} solo under <b>the</b> name <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> in late 1996, the remaining members Jeroen Hobert, Marco Hovius and Arjan Pronk formed the band After Dust, later renaming themselves 16 Down.|$|R

25|$|From the Renaissance {{the numbers}} shown widened slightly, {{and the various}} scenes – the high living, herding the pigs, and the return – of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> became the clear favourite. Albrecht Dürer made a famous {{engraving}} of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance. Rembrandt depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career. At least one of his works, <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> in the Tavern, a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene - if the title was indeed the original intention of the artist. His late Return of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> (1662–1669, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) {{is one of his}} most popular works.|$|E

They entered the village together with Chapeau, about nine in the morning, having been met {{about a mile from}} the town, by four or five friends, who escorted them back.

25|$|In 1978 and 1981, Hung {{made two}} films that contain fine {{examples}} of the Wing Chun style. The first, Warriors Two was the most significant role to date for South Korean super kicker Casanova Wong, who teamed up with Hung in the final fight. The second film was <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son,</b> in which the Wing Chun fighting was performed by Lam Ching-Ying. The release of <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son,</b> along with another film directed by and co-starring Hung, Knockabout (1979) also shot his fellow Opera schoolmate Yuen Biao to stardom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifteenth}} and sixteenth centuries the theme was a {{sufficiently}} popular subject that <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> <b>Son</b> Play {{can be seen}} as a subgenre of the English morality play.
