5|$|In 1593, the Ottoman Empire {{conquered the}} area that is now Odessa Oblast, and {{incorporated}} it as the Özü Eyalet, unofficially known as the Khanate of Ukraine. In {{the aftermath of the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1787–92, Yedisan, roughly corresponding to the modern city of Odessa, was recognised by the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Jassy as being a part of the Russian Empire. According to the first Russian Empire census of the Yedisan region, conducted in 1793 after the expulsion of the Nogai Tatars, forty-nine villages out of the sixty-seven between the Dniester River and the Southern Bug River were ethnically Romanian (also called Moldavians). Subsequently, ethnic Russians colonised the area, and established many new cities and ports. In 1819, the city of Odessa became a free port. It was home to a very diverse population, and was frequented by Black Sea traders. In less than a century, the city of Odessa grew from a small fortress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> city in the region of New Russia.|$|E

Its opening there set a record for a foreign language film, making $3 million. The film was officially released in the United Kingdom on July 27, making £8.7 million, and helped contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> attendance record ever for that weekend.

5|$|Juventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, {{increasing}} €104,807,731.60 of share capital. The {{team made}} an aggregate net {{loss in the}} following seasons (2006 to date): –€927,569 (2006–07), –€20,787,469 (2007–08), net income €6,582,489 (2008–09) and net loss €10,967,944 (2009–10). After an unaudited €43,411,481 net loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season net loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan. Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 2013–14 financial year closed with a loss of €6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006. In the 2014–15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached €2.3million. Compared to the loss of €6.7million last year, 2014–15 showed a positive change of €9million and returned to a profit after six years since 2008–09.|$|E

25|$|In November 2009, a {{community}} of 1500-2500 Zimbabwean farm workers was forcibly evicted from {{their homes in the}} informal settlements of De Doorns, a grape-farming town in the Western Cape. No persons were physically assaulted but homes were trashed and looted and this led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> displacement of foreign nationals since May 2008. The Zimbabweans were then housed in a displaced persons' camp where some remained for a year until it was closed. Researchers identified the role of a ward councillor, Mpumelelo Lubisi, in inciting the attack in possible collusion with informal labour brokers who had financial interests in getting rid of their Zimbabwean competitors. South African workers also accused farmers of employing the Zimbabweans at less than minimum wage (farmers and Zimbabwean workers denied this).|$|E

25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to field – a {{decision}} which looked correct {{as the new}} ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed {{to take advantage of}} this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen could consider themselves unlucky to get out <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg into the waiting hands of Monty Panesar.

25|$|Paz Zamora's {{regime was}} less decisive against {{narcotics}} trafficking.

Also, his administration was extremely reluctant to pursue coca eradication. It did not agree to an updated extradition treaty with the US, although two traffickers have been extradited to the U.S. since 1992. Beginning in early 1994, the Bolivian Congress investigated Paz Zamora's personal ties to accused major trafficker Isaac Chavarria, who subsequently died in prison while awaiting trial. MIR deputy chief Oscar Eid was jailed in connection with similar ties in 1994; he was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years in prison in November 1996. Technically still under investigation, Paz Zamora became an active presidential candidate in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Porto {{started the}} 2014–15 season with their biggest budget ever, hiring Spanish head coach Julen Lopetegui.

Porto continued their losing trend in the 2015–16 season, making it the third consecutive trophyless season, with the contribution of José Peseiro, who had replaced Julen Lopetegui in January 2016.
