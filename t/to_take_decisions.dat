25|$|Over time, the Romanisation of {{the city}} brought the two {{communities}} closer together. Notable members of the peregrini increasingly adopted Roman culture and behaviour, became Roman citizens, and the councils of the two communities began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> in unison. The increasing closeness of the communities was facilitated at first by their geographic proximity - there was no physical distinction between their two settlements - and then later by institutional arrangements. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the city was granted Roman law; from this moment onward, the magistrates automatically received Roman citizenship and the rights {{of the city}}'s inhabitants became {{similar to those of the}} Roman citizens. During the same era, the pagus won a certain degree of autonomy from Carthage; it was able to receive bequests and administer public funds.|$|E

This agreement was given effect by the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council Act, 1995. The council came into being with the holding of elections in Leh District on 28 August 1995. The inaugural meeting of the council was held at Leh on 3 September 1995. Kargil, later, adopted the Hill council in July 2003, when the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council— Kargil was established. The council works with village panchayats <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> on economic development, healthcare, education, land use, taxation, and local governance which are further reviewed at the block headquarters {{in the presence of}} the chief executive councilor and executive councilors.

Former Socialist Prime Minister Felipe González added to the pressure by declaring that he felt [...] "cheated" [...] by Sánchez. This was followed by the resignation of 17 members from the party's executive committee on 28 September in order to trigger Sánchez's own resignation. Sánchez refused to acknowledge his ouster and remained in his position, with critics responding that Sánchez no longer had [...] "any legitimacy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> in the party's name" [...] and urging him to [...] "acknowledge party rules".|$|E

2500|$|By April 10, as Vladimirescu already {{met with}} Ottomans envoys, Filipescu had been {{informed}} that their forces held Roșiorii de Vede. Alongside the Metropolitan, Vulpea then {{asked that the}} Divan be granted safe passage to Transylvania. Vladimirescu allowed them to exit Bucharest under armed guard, but only to detain them at Golescu's Belvedere Manor, outside Ciurel. Here, they were besieged by the rogue Eterist Binbaşı Sava Fochianos, who led a crew of Arnauts and militarized tanners; eventually, the boyars persuaded Fochianos to withdraw. Historian Emil Vârtosu believes that Filipescu {{and the others were}} arrested when Vladimirescu realized that they would not support his egalitarian agenda, and that they still believed themselves unbound by his rules. However, in the notebooks kept by Pavel Liprandi, Filipescu and Gheorghiadis appear as a double-dealers who influenced Vladimirescu and the [...] "intellectually frail" [...] Metropolitan <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> that favored the Divan.

2500|$|The {{passing of}} the revolutionary Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, a [...] "grass roots home rule" [...] Act, totally reorganised the old aristocratic {{landlord}} [...] "Grand Juries", eliminating their power by transferring it to Local County Councils elected by tenant farmers, town traders and labourers. The creation of the new councils {{had a significant effect}} on Ireland as it allowed local people <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> affecting themselves. The County and the sub-county District Councils also created a political platform for proponents of Irish Home Rule, displacing Unionist influence in many areas. The enfranchisement of local electors allowed {{the development of a new}} political class, creating a significant body of experienced politicians who began to take local affairs into their own hands. This coincided with William O'Brien founding the United Irish League (UIL), the wide expansion of the agricultural co-operative movement established earlier by Horace Plunkett and Sheehan becoming both President of the ILLA and editor of the Skibbereen based The Southern Star newspaper. He assured that the ILLA as well as the UIL were given weekly press coverage of their branch reports, particularly crucial for the expansion and growth of the UIL in Cork.|$|E
2500|$|Politicians in {{the three}} island groups {{referred}} to the Scottish referendum {{as the most important}} event in their political history [...] "since the inception of the island councils in 1975". Angus Campbell, leader of the Western Isles, said that the ongoing constitutional debate offered the [...] "opportunity for the three island councils to secure increased powers for our communities <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> which will benefit the economies and the lives of those who live in the islands". In a meeting of the island councils in March 2013, leaders of the three territories discussed their future in the event of Scottish independence. This included whether the islands could demand and achieve autonomous status within either Scotland or the rest of the UK. Among the scenarios proposed were achieving either Crown Dependency status or self-government modelled after the Faroe Islands, in association with either Scotland or the UK. Steven Heddle, Orkney's council leader, described pursuing Crown Dependency status as the least likely option, as it would threaten funding from the EU, which is essential for local farmers. Alasdair Allan, MSP for the Western Isles, said independence could {{have a positive impact on}} the isles, as [...] "crofters and farmers could expect a substantial uplift in agricultural and rural development funding via the Common Agricultural Policy if Scotland were an independent member state of the EU".|$|E
2500|$|While {{developing}} the scenario, the team {{needed to work}} carefully so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in social norms since the original's release, in particular a scene where Cloud cross-dressed as a woman {{as part of an}} infiltration mission. The team were also planning to include references to events detailed in the Compilation titles, though what form these reference will take and their scope is still under consideration. Nomura later clarified that, as of early 2017, Remake did not share a direct continuity with the Compilation. The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015. The game will be fully voiced, and the plan is for the voice actors from the CGI movie [...] to reprise their roles, although not all of them have been asked yet and characters who were limited to cameo appearances such as Red XIII may be recast. The subtitle [...] "Remake" [...] was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was originally going to be story-related, but the team did not want {{to give the impression that}} it was a sequel or spin-off. Rather than using the character models and graphical style of Advent Children, which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of Advent Children with deformed stylization. Nomura is in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari is in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modelling is being supervised by Visual Works, Square Enix's CGI development branch.|$|E
