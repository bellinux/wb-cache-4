It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E

5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening.

Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> caused by {{a decrease in the}} extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a {{saprobic}} species, and derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down the complex insoluble polysaccharides found in woody material, such as cellulose and lignin. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests. Basswood has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in late fall. Although the distribution appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> restricted to the eastern United States, it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.|$|E

The gene, initially named TES-56, was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> {{expressed in the}} telencephalic vesicles of the developing forebrain of mice. The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which {{plays a role in}} establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to its relation to T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E

The season was released on DVD by Universal Studios Home Entertainment in a four-disc box set in the Region 1 area on September 2, 2008.

It also contains deleted scenes from all of the episodes, as well as bloopers and other promos.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of}} the population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time.

His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E

5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to external pressure, domestic policies {{implemented by the}} Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>largely</b> ineffective in stimulating the country’s economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of central economic planning, Vietnam placed most emphasis {{on the development of}} heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated. Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output were driven down by dislocation of the general population. In {{addition to}} those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26 million regular soldiers under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984. Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea, despite receiving $1.2 billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam’s economic rebuilding efforts.|$|E
