5|$|In Chesapeake City, <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Country Scenic Byway {{ends and}} MD 213 {{continues}} north {{as a part}} of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway which crosses the state of Maryland. Past this interchange, MD 213 passes over <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> and Delaware Canal on <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> City Bridge. Upon crossing the canal, the road intersects MD 285 (Lock Street), which provides access to the northern portion of Chesapeake City. Past MD 285, the route resumes through a mix of woodland and farmland, with residential areas increasing along the road. A park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of the Frenchtown Road intersection. It approaches the Elkton area and heads through residential areas.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with a consortium of railroads and steamship companies to merge <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Steamship Company into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Southern Railway, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Steamship Company. As a result, the Old Bay Line took over <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Line's business and assets and became the sole operator of passenger and freight steamship transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake Steamship Company, which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Line's steamboats, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond, were transferred to the Old Bay Line. As it turned out, these {{would be the last}} two vessels operated by the Old Bay Line when it went out of business in 1962. Robert E. Dunn was named president of the Old Bay Line in 1941, remaining {{at the helm of the}} company to the end of service in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded {{that they were going to}} join forces at <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake.</b> He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived at the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{debris and}} waste being carried into {{waterways}} by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay to shellfishing {{for four days}} from <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay Bridge–Tunnel {{to the mouth of}} the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2–3days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{forecasts}} {{predicted a}} landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, with winds of 100mph (160km/h); however, these forecasts {{were made with}} great uncertainty. While Felix was still near Bermuda on August15, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the eastern United States from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia and including the Pamlico Sound, Albemarle Sound, and southern portions of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. Tropical storm warnings were also issued from Chincoteague to near Manasquan, New Jersey, including <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> and Delaware bays. The watches and warnings remained in place until August18. Despite the lack of landfall, the NHC deemed the watches and warnings as appropriate due to the projected track.|$|E

5|$|MD 285 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Augustine Herman Highway) {{at the north}} end of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> City Bridge. The highway heads east as two-lane Lock Street, which curves south at county-maintained Hemphill Street. MD 285 curves to the southwest at its junction with the north end of MD 284 (Hemphill Street) and enters the town of Chesapeake City. The highway continues to Biddle Street, onto which the route turns east; Lock Street continues south to <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> & Delaware Canal. MD 285 meets the southern end of MD 284 (Hemphill Street) and passes through an S-curve before leaving the town. The highway parallels the canal to the north and intersects Knights Corner Road before reaching its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, from which the highway continues as Chesapeake City Road.|$|E
5|$|MD 404 was {{designated}} by 1933 {{to run from}} Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987.|$|E
5|$|News of Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realize}} that <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> was the probable target of the French fleets. By 31 August, Graves had moved his five ships of the line out of New York harbor to meet with Hood's force. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived {{at the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring.|$|E

The teacher background narrative allows teachers to understand that life in <b>the</b> colonial <b>Chesapeake</b> varied widely depending on race, socioeconomic status, and whether one was free, slave, or indentured. The tour and classroom materials are tailored for upper elementary students, and aims to give students a nuanced view of childhood in <b>the</b> colonial <b>Chesapeake</b> as well as to help them place their local history within the larger framework of Maryland and American history...|$|R

5|$|News of de Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realise}} that <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> was the probable {{target of the}} French fleets.

5|$|On {{environmental}} issues, Mathias {{established a}} {{record as a}} strong advocate of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay. After touring the bay shoreline in 1973, he sponsored legislation {{that led to a}} study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) two years later, which was one of the first reports that made the public aware of harmful levels of nutrients and toxins in the waters. As a result, the report was one of the catalysts for cleanup efforts, and evolved into <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake</b> Bay Program. In recognition, the Charles Mathias Laboratory, part of the Smithsonian Institution, was established in 1988 as a research facility to analyze human impact on the bay. In 1990, the Mathias Medal was established by Maryland Sea Grant at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science as further acknowledgment of Mathias' environmental record. In 2003, thirty years after he launched a study of <b>the</b> <b>Chesapeake,</b> Mathias was recognized by the Army Corps of Engineers for the influential role he played initiating restoration efforts.|$|E
