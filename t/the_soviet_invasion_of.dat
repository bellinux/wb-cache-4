Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E

5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo.

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E

5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, {{which resulted}} in a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{a statue}} of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was {{demolished}} in 1939 by Soviet troops {{in the aftermath of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Poland. In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.|$|E

5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special propellers with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944.

5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SSTashkent, but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|The 1930s aside, Hobsbawm was criticised for never relinquishing his Communist Party membership.

5|$|She {{was renamed}} Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to {{disassociate}} her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She remained inactive during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged {{from the government}} after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; one says that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan in December 1979 and {{threatened}} {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
5|$|The war in Europe {{concluded}} with {{an invasion of}} Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Manchuria, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.|$|E
