The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. <b>The</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, and thus, {{is the only}} Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|When {{violence}} started {{between the}} Bábís and the Qajar {{government in the}} later part of 1848, Bahá'u'lláh tried to reach the besieged Bábís at the Shaykh Tabarsi in Mazandaran, but was arrested and imprisoned {{before he could get}} there. The following years until 1850 saw the Bábís being massacred in various provinces after the Báb publicly made his claim of being <b>the</b> <b>Manifestation</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|E

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> glucocorticoid excess. It {{can be the}} result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently {{amounted to a}} footnote. For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked {{the start of the}} appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his Book of the AntiChrist prophecies were fulfilled through <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Babalon in her person.|$|E
5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E

5|$|Soma ascends to the castle's {{keep and}} confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole desire {{is to leave}} the castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, who require physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind {{the health of}} a city is based on traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , <b>the</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> its will as female (yin). In contrast, their theory treats the humans and agents as the children of the city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
