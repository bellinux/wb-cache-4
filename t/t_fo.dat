40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to study the genetic {{diversity}} within and among 6 Tuber taxa, the phylogenetic relationships and the spatial distribution of truffles from the Basilicata region (southern Italy). Molecular analyses, using the internal transcribed spacer region, microsatellites, minisatellites and random amplified polymorphic loci revealed the highest expected intra-specific heterozygosity (He= 0. 30) in T. aestivum, followed by that of T. mesentericum (He= 0. 22). T. borchii (He= 0. 17), T. magnatum (He= 0. 16), <b>T.</b> aestivum <b>fo.</b> uncinatum (He= 0. 12) and <b>T.</b> brumale <b>fo.</b> moschatum (He= 0. 09) showed a lower average heterozygosity. The whole set of markers were demonstrated to be useful in clearly differentiating Tuber taxa, separating them in two distinct groups and in five sub-clusters, each corresponding to one single taxon. The first cluster (T. borchii, T. magnatum and <b>T.</b> brumale <b>fo.</b> moschatum) was more differentiated than the second one (T. aestivum, <b>T.</b> aestivum <b>fo.</b> uncinatum and <b>T.</b> mesentericum). <b>T.</b> brumale <b>fo.</b> moschatum was the most differentiated Tuber taxon. It was more related to the white truffles (the closely related T. borchii and T. magnatum) than to the remaining related black truffles T. aestivum and T. mesentericum. The amount of Tuber species richness was higher over {{the western side of}} Basilicata, in cold Lauretum and in Castanetum phytoclimatic Pavari’s zones. A spatial genetic structure was detected for T. aestivum, as shown by the significant correlation between geographic and genetic distances (rs= 0. 32; P< 0. 0001).

40|$|It {{has been}} widely pointed out that {{classical}} ontology {{is not sufficient to}} deal with imprecise and vague knowledge for some real-world applications like personal diabetic-diet recommendation. On the other hand, fuzzy ontology can effectively help to handle and process uncertain data and knowledge. This paper proposes a novel ontology model, which is based on interval type- 2 fuzzy sets (T 2 FSs), called type- 2 fuzzy ontology (<b>T</b> 2 <b>FO),</b> with applications to knowledge representation in the field of personal diabetic-diet recommendation. The <b>T</b> 2 <b>FO</b> is composed of 1) a type- 2 fuzzy personal profile ontology (type- 2 FPPO); 2) a type- 2 fuzzy food ontology (type- 2 FFO); and 3) a type- 2 fuzzy-personal food ontology (type- 2 FPFO). In addition, the paper also presents a T 2 FS-based intelligent diet-recommendation agent (IDRA), including 1) T 2 FS construction; 2) a T 2 FS-based personal ontology filter; 3) a T 2 FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism; 4) a T 2 FS-based diet-planning mechanism; 5) a T 2 FS-based menu-recommendation mechanism; and 6) a T 2 FS-based semantic-description mechanism. In the proposed approach, first, the domain experts plan the diet goal for the involved diabetes and create the nutrition facts of common Taiwanese food. Second, the involved diabetics are requested to routinely input eaten items. Third, the ontology-creating mechanism constructs a <b>T</b> 2 <b>FO,</b> including a type- 2 FPPO, a type- 2 FFO, and a set of type- 2 FPFOs. Finally, the T 2 FS-based IDRA retrieves the built <b>T</b> 2 <b>FO</b> to recommend a personal diabetic meal plan. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can work effectively and that the menu can be provided as a reference for the involved diabetes after diet validation by domain experts. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

On Ischia and in the Phlegrean Fields, groundwaters range in composition from NaCl brines, which we interpret as the surface discharge of deep reservoir fluids, to shallow-depth circulating fluids, the latter ranging from acid-sulphate steam-heated to hypothermal, cold, bicarbonate groundwaters. Arsenic concentrations range from 1. 6 to 6900 μg·l- 1 and from 2. 6 to 3800 μg·l- 1 in the Phlegrean Fields and on Ischia, respectively. They increase with increasing water temperature and chlorine contents, and in the sequence bicarbonate groundwaters < steam-heated groundwaters < NaCl brines.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of chemical elements during metal/silicate segregation and their resulting distribution in Earth's mantle and core {{provide insight into}} core formation processes. Experimental determination of partition coefficients allows calculations of element distributions that {{can be compared to}} accepted values of element abundances in the silicate (mantle) and metallic (core) portions of the Earth. Tungsten (W) is a moderately siderophile element and thus preferentially partitions into metal versus silicate under many planetary conditions. The partitioning behavior has been shown to vary with temperature, silicate composition, oxygen fugacity, and pressure. Most of the previous work on W partitioning has been conducted at 1 -bar conditions or at relatively low pressures, i. e. < 10 GPa, and in two cases at or near 20 GPa. According to those data, the stronger influences on the distribution coefficient of W are temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity with a relatively slight influence in pressure. Predictions based on extrapolation of existing data and parameterizations suggest an increased pressured dependence on metal/ silicate partitioning of W at higher pressures 5. However, the dependence on pressure is not as well constrained as <b>T,</b> <b>fO</b> 2, and silicate composition. This poses a problem because proposed equilibration pressures for core formation range from 27 to 50 GPa, falling well outside the experimental range, therefore requiring exptrapolation of a parametereized model.
