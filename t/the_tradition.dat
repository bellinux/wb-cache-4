5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> {{declined}} {{in the early to}} mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. <b>The</b> <b>tradition</b> has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E

5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E

5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> took place on or its {{geographical}} location.

He also thought it noteworthy that they described <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E
