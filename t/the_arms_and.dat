5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop {{has a family}} coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, not least because their descendants may seek reassignment of <b>the</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and {{two rows of}} tube feet with suckers. There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates on <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also known}} as the [...] "fencing reflex" [...] because of the {{characteristic}} position of <b>the</b> infant's <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> head, which resembles that of a classically trained fencer. When the face is turned to one side, <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> leg on <b>the</b> side to which the face is turned extend <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> leg on <b>the</b> opposite side flex.|$|R

It goes through <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> first in <b>the</b> posterior compartment of <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> later in <b>the</b> anterior compartment of <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> continues in <b>the</b> posterior compartment of the forearm.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Munchkin {{partnered with}} Church and Dwight, <b>the</b> maker of <b>Arm</b> <b>and</b> Hammer baking soda to {{introduce}} a line of diapering products that work with pure, natural baking soda. <b>The</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>and</b> Hammer Diaper Pail by Munchkin is a patented system helping with odor control <b>and</b> uses <b>Arm</b> <b>and</b> Hammer baking soda combined with a self-sealing lid to lock in odors. In 2011, <b>The</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>and</b> Hammer Diaper Pail won the [...] "American Baby Bests Award".|$|R
5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found {{along the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> the eyes are more developed.|$|E
5|$|When Singapore became self-governing in 1959 Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was {{determined}} to create for the new state a coat of arms, among other symbols, to replace the coat of arms of the United Kingdom {{that had been in}} use until then. A committee was formed to design the state symbols, headed by the deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, who wanted both <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> flag of Singapore to represent the country's united, multi-ethnic society.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E

5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, in {{the early}} hours of Day 53, Tom voluntarily left the Big Brother House. For the {{shopping}} task the housemates split into two groups, creating human puppets with one housemate providing the head and feet and another providing <b>the</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> making them dance to music by Girls Aloud and Take That. Visitors to the Big Brother web site decided by voting that the housemates had failed the task. On Day 56, Noirin's ex-boyfriend Isaac entered the House, but left voluntarily shortly after Noirin's eviction on Day 58 with 60.0% of the public vote.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E

5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. <b>The</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|The Bone {{military}} leader Petta Panggawae and his Songko' Borrong soldiers invaded Pangala' and sided with Pong Maramba', a minor lord. Panggawae overtook Tiku's capital at Tondon and razed the city, leading Tiku and {{the civilian population}} to abandon the area. Tiku, having sided with the Sidenreng leader Andi Guru, was able to retake {{the remains of the}} capital that night. The war ended in 1890, after Dutch scouts– representing the colonial government on Java– reached Bone. However, the remaining states soon began another series of struggles over <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> slave trade, where states would exchange weapons for slaves; Tiku also participated in the trade.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. <b>The</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E

The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs.|$|E
