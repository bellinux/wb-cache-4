Saarinen was awarded $20,000 for second place; his design was never constructed.

5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his works in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> natural and {{architectural}} surroundings {{by studying the}} location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an underground station below the water table requires rigorous and careful planning. As such an in depth knowledge of the station construction designs and the related hydraulic behavior are {{required in order to}} design <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>appropriated</b> drainage system. Moreover, it is important to ensure the correct drainage of the excavation site to avoid liquefaction and to minimize water seepage. As an example of underground construction we consider the tunnel for the new line in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Línia 9) through the town of Prat de Llobregat in the Llobregat River’s delta, which is currently under development. <b>Most</b> of <b>the</b> tunnel sections are constructed with Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) and the stations and the ventilation shafts are constructed using “Cut & Cover” technology between sheet pile walls.

5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
