50|$|Closures need a {{means of}} {{attaching}} to the container with sufficient security. <b>Threads,</b> <b>lugs,</b> hinges, locks, adhesives, etc. are used.|$|R
40|$|An {{extendable}} {{column is}} described {{which consists of}} several axially elongated rigid structural sections nested within one another. Each section includes a number of rotatably attached screws running along its length. The next inner section includes <b>threaded</b> <b>lugs</b> oriented to threadingly engage the screws. The column is extended or retracted upon rotation of the screws. The screws of each section are selectively rotated by a motor and an engagement mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|The 760 {{featured}} a detachable box magazine, dual action bars, and a removable aluminum trigger group. The bolt featured 14 locking lugs {{laid out in}} an interrupted-thread pattern. These lugs locked into corresponding lugs in a barrel extension {{by means of a}} cam-rotated bolt. [...] This bolt arrangement was problematic and the interrupted <b>thread</b> <b>lugs</b> were replaced with more conventional lugs on the Model 7600 that replaced it.|$|R
5000|$|Model 1910 (Mk III) {{was made}} with a totally {{different}} bolt head; instead of having the solid bolt lugs travel in a vertical position and lock in a horizontal position, like for the Mk II and Mk II** (see illustration), Ross turned it 90 degrees so it travels in an horizontal position and locks vertically. Then, he used screw <b>threads</b> on the <b>lugs</b> outside which are locking into the matching threaded receiver. Some very scarce Mk II** with the same <b>threaded</b> <b>lugs</b> and receiver are known to exist. He also used the same shape of heavy barrel as used on the Mk II**. The M-10, in [...]280 Ross, {{is considered by many}} as being the finest rifle ever made by the Ross Rifle Co.|$|R
50|$|Model 1907 and 1905/1910 Match Target Rifle These very {{important}} single-shot rifles (two rifles {{are known to}} exist) are bearing special feature {{that would make the}} M1910 so different; the <b>threaded</b> locking <b>lugs</b> and receiver.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ruger Mini-14GB with {{a pistol}} grip, side folding stock, 30-round magazine, bayonet <b>lug,</b> <b>threaded</b> barrel, and flash suppressor.|$|R
5000|$|A {{screw closure}} is a {{mechanical}} device which is screwed {{on and off}} of a threaded [...] "finish" [...] on a container. Either continuous <b>threads</b> (C-T) or <b>lugs</b> are used. Metal caps can be either preformed or in some instances, rolled on after application. Plastic caps may use several types of molded polymer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{screw closure}} is a {{mechanical}} device which is screwed {{on and off}} of a [...] "finish" [...] on a container. Either continuous <b>threads</b> or <b>lugs</b> are used. It must be engineered to be cost-effective, to provide an effective seal (and barrier), to be compatible with the contents, to be easily opened by the consumer, often to be reclosable, and to comply with product, package, and environmental laws and regulations. Some closures need to be tamper resistant and have child-resistant packaging features. A tamper-evident band is a common tamper warning for screw caps of bottles, for example.|$|R
25|$|The Mini-14 GB ("government bayonet") models feature {{either a}} pistol grip, side folding stock or a {{standard}} semi-pistol grip stock, a 20 or 30-round magazine, bayonet <b>lug,</b> <b>threaded</b> barrel, and flash suppressor. The GB models also come with standard rifle stocks. Sales {{are intended for}} only the law enforcement, military and private security markets, and can only be found in their Law Enforcement Catalog. However, some have entered the civilian market.|$|R
50|$|Much {{time was}} wasted {{trying to make}} the MP 43 a {{replacement}} for the Kar 98k rifle. This goal was eventually realized to be impossible; the MP 43 cartridge was too weak to fire rifle grenades, too inaccurate for sniping, and the weapon was too short for bayonet fighting. In September 1943, it was decided that the MP 43 would supplement rather than replace the Kar 98k. As a result, the optical sight base, grenade-launching extended muzzle <b>thread,</b> and bayonet <b>lug</b> were removed.|$|R
5000|$|During the race, NASCAR ordered Chad Knaus {{and members}} of Hendrick Motorsports {{to report to the}} NASCAR hauler after the race. Knaus will not face any {{penalties}} for putting in a wheel spacer. [...] “It’s really not a big deal,’’ Robin Pemberton said. “We were trying to clairfy what went on. I’m {{not going to get into}} the weeds on (the rule), but sometimes if you thought you had an issue with a wheel stud or something mechanical like that, you may need to put a spacer on to get some clean <b>threads</b> for the <b>lug</b> nuts. I have no idea (why they wanted it on), that’s not our question. It really is such a minute deal. It’s fine. Everything is good.’’ ...|$|R
5000|$|JLD Enterprises (JLD) {{purchased}} {{prints and}} tooling from Fábrica de Braço de Prata, an H&K-licensed, military factory based in Portugal. JLD then began manufacturing ban-compliant PTR-91 rifles in 2002. These ban-compliant models {{did not have}} a <b>threaded</b> barrel, bayonet <b>lugs,</b> adjustable stocks, or [...] "high-capacity" [...] magazines. Very early models were produced directly from the Portuguese prints and were nearly identical to the HK91 with the exception of modifications for compliance with the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. Once the ban expired in 2004, JLD began offering a wider range of PTR-91 models, many of which featured more of the original military features of the storied G3. JLD also began investing in research and development, and debuted new improvements and modifications to the original HK91 design. Initially, JLD-produced rifles relied heavily on imported military surplus components to complete their G3-variant. Most parts between HK-91 and PTR-91 guns were and continue to be interchangeable.|$|R
