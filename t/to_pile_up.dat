5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E

25|$|The {{lack of a}} {{vigorous}} response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach. Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.|$|E
50|$|This {{dramatic}} turn-around {{is considered}} {{to be the result of}} the Miracle on the Han River, a term coined to describe Seoul's highly accelerated and successful development since the early 1960s. Used charcoal briquettes and other industrial waste materials produced during the city's rapid development in this period led <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>ups</b> of trash. By the 1990s, these <b>pile</b> <b>ups</b> grew <b>to</b> mountains at a height of 95 meters and length of 2 kilometers, even after being compressed into a rectangular shape that weighed over 120 million tons. This was in comparison to the Namsan mountain in Seoul, which is 262 meters.

On the French side, 47 soldiers were killed and 83 wounded, while all the French cavalry horses were lost, despite not being utilized. There were also about 500 wounded Druze who were captured after the battle as prisoners of war. They were ordered by Andréa <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> the slain rebels and residents of al-Musayfirah in front of the village to serve as an example. The POWs were subsequently executed. The battle of al-Musayfirah marked the first French victory during the revolt.|$|E
25|$|Student unrest {{became a}} regular feature of Ethiopian {{life in the}} 1960s and 1970s. Marxism took root in large {{segments}} of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular {{in other parts of the}} globe. Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up,</b> Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, Aklilu Habte Wold, and concentrated more on foreign affairs.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{the first}} time a temple had been {{constructed}} at Rome to ward off plague. The consul, Gnaeus Julius Mento, one of two for the year 431 BCE, dedicated a temple to Apollo medicus ("the healer"). There was also a temple to salus ("health") on the Mons Salutaris, a spur of the Quirinal. There is no record that these earlier temples possessed the medical facilities associated with an Aesculapium; in that case, the later decision to bring them in presupposes a new understanding that scientific measures could be taken against plague.

But in Game 2, Helterbrand injured his hamstring giving the momentum to the Express for a 124–90 rout, the worst loss of Uichico in his entire coaching career. As their injuries continued <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up,</b> they lost Game 3 and Helterbrand {{for the rest of}} the series. However, the Kings managed to tie the series with a 90–77 win in Game 4. Tubid also returned during Game 4 from a dislocated left ankle and lift Ginebra, but lost a close 76–73 in Game 5. In Game 6, the Kings proved that they were more worthy of the title by extending the series to a Game 7 with an 80–75 victory, thanks to Alexander's 37 points (20 in the 3rd quarter) to lift the Kings despite an injury plagued lineup. In Game 7, with the injury suffered by Junthy Valenzuela (tendinitis) and Alexander having cramps in the third quarter, the locals led by Tubid and Menk had a terrific performance to maintain the lead and seal the 97–84 victory, and won the series 4–3 to grab their 8th championship. With the victory, they surpassed Purefoods in titles won. Tubid and Menk was named as co-Finals MVP. Uichico also won his 8th PBA title as a coach and his second with Ginebra.

Samboy Lim is a graduate of San Beda High School and also played for the San Beda Red Cubs (the Juniors Basketball team of San Beda). After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued <b>to</b> <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of #2 ranked San Sebastian. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th trophy was still presented to them. In 1983, the heavily favored Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball due to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of resting in the hospital (he suffered an asthma attack in Game 2 and has to be sent in the hospital that night) and captured their 2nd straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season but Samboy Lim's heroics left an indelible impression to the hearts of those who witnessed it. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only 5 schools participating but it didn't distract the Knights as they secured a date with history as the become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season and RP Team patron Danding Cojuangco gave him a spot on the National Team roster.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decades much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} understanding the factors controlling the shape of the unloading curves obtained by the Oliver and Pharr nanoindentation analysis in order to estimate true contact area, and material parameters such as Young's modulus and hardness. In fact, {{it is well known that}} the Oliver and Pharr analysis can overestimate the hardness of materials that plastically deform due <b>to</b> <b>piling</b> <b>up</b> around the indentation. In recent years, different visual and analytical methods have been proposed. The visual methods are based on direct measurements of the produced indentation by scanning probe microscopy (SPM) or by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In the present work, indentation hardness of a SiO 2 coating was measured and analyzed by both visual and analytical methods. The SPM-based direct method showed a quite good qualitative and quantitative literature data agreement. This method was thus developed and improved to make it dependent on curve parameters, such as applied load and penetration depth, rather than on SPM measurements of the actual contact area. A correlation of the <b>pile</b> <b>up</b> phenomenon <b>to</b> the m exponent of the P=B(h-hf) m relationship was also discussed...|$|R
