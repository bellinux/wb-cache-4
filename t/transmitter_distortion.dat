The ability to transmit and receive ever-increasing amounts of extremely high rate data is an enduring challenge {{in the arena of}} near-earth space borne science missions. Reliable and efficient transmission of information at these data rates requires the use of power and bandwidth efficient modulations that exhibit low transmitter, receiver, and decoder complexity. Conventional high rate approaches for achieving spectral limiting typically employ sharp post amplifier filtering at the transmitter to limit the interference to the adjacent bands. However, using analog filtering alone can produce substantial intersymbol interference and other distortions that substantially affect the detection performance of the signal. In contrast, various theoretical classes of modulation waveforms can be tailored to provide varying degrees of bandwidth and power efficiency or robustness to non-linear <b>transmitter</b> <b>distortions</b> while incurring little or no performance losses.

40|$|Modern digital {{communication}} systems utilize OFDM and DS-CDMA signals {{because of their}} superior spectral efficiency and multiple access properties respectively. Examples of such systems include digital television (DVB-T), digital radio (DAB) and 3 ʳᵈ Generation mobile (WCDMA). A downside to using these signals however {{is the need to}} accommodate their very high Crest Factor, also known as Peak-to-Average Power Ratio, during transmission. Compared to other communication signals transmitted with the same average power, these signals generate greater <b>transmitter</b> <b>distortion</b> since their larger signal peaks drive the transmitter power amplifier into regions of greater nonlinearity. Reducing this Crest Factor related distortion, whilst concurrently maintaining power amplifier efficiency, requires the power amplifier's transfer characteristic to be externally linearized. For OFDM and DS-CDMA signals, digital predistortion is the favored linearization technique given its cost effectiveness, superior signal processing capability, potential to adapt and ability to linearize the entire transmitter. In this research thesis, a new digital predistortion technique is proposed. By employing frequency-domain information feedback, rather than traditional time-domain signal feedback, the new technique avoids bandwidth limitations in the feedback path and is hence more suited to wideband applications than current generation techniques. This frequency-domain information feedback is based on the novel Weighted Adjacent Channel Power (WACP) linearization objective. By incorporating frequency dependent weighting into the standard accumulation of Adjacent Channel Power (ACP), this novel linearization objective is able to discriminate between spectral distortion components and hence control the location of spectral distortion reduction. This makes linearization more robust in the presence of residual predistortion filtering inaccuracies. To accommodate the power amplifier memory effects associated with wideband signal modulation, the new technique uses a predistortion filter architecture based on the classic nonlinear dynamic Volterra Series. Mindful of Volterra kernel efficiency, the technique further applies a novel hybridized triple-stage pruning strategy, leaving the kernel size not only linear with respect to memory, but also independent of hardware sampling rate implementation. This pruning activity ultimately reduces the number of dynamic filter parameters needing to be estimated. This new digital predistortion technique utilizes generic mathematical optimization to estimate the resulting predistortion filter kernel, with frequency-domain WACP interpreted as the linearizing optimization objective. In line with theory, the objective is assumed to be nonconvex and hence both global and local optimization algorithms are employed to achieve true global convergence. This is in direct contrast to the traditional and competing Direct Learning technique which is more focused on quick local convergence, and less focused on guaranteeing maximum linearization performance corresponding to the objective global minimum. Since predistortion filter kernel estimation is performed using the transmitted wideband signal, the new technique is ultimately on-air adaptive. This means any transmitter using the technique will be both on-air and optimally linearized for its entire operational life...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze and improve linearity of envelope elimination and restoration (EER) radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers. Envelope elimination and restoration was compared to other efficiency enhancement techniques and determined to likely be the most suitable solution for implementation of multimode, multiband portable RF <b>transmitters.</b> <b>Distortion,</b> stemming from dynamic power-supply modulation of RF transistors in EER RF power amplifiers was identified as one of the key challenges to the development of commercially viable EER transmitters. This dissertation presents a study of phase distortion in RF power amplifiers (PAs) with emphasis on identification of the origins of phase distortion in EER RF power amplifiers. Circuit-level techniques for distortion mitigation are also presented. Memory effects in conventional power amplifiers are investigated through the accurate measurement and analysis of phase asymmetry of out-of-band distortion components. Novel physically-based power amplifier model is developed for attributing measured memory effects to their physical origin. The amount of linearity correction, obtained through pre-distortion for a particular RF power amplifier, is then correlated to the behavior of the memory effects in the corresponding PA. Heterojunction field-effect transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistor amplifiers are used for investigation of voltage-dependent phase distortion in handset EER RF PAs. The distortion is found to stem from vector addition of signals, generated in nonlinear circuit elements of the PA. Specifically, nonlinear base-collector capacitance and downconversion of distortion components from second harmonic frequency are found to be the dominant sources of phase distortion. Shorting of second harmonic is proposed as a way to reduce the distortion contribution of the downconverted signal. Phase distortion is reduced by 50 %, however a slight degradation in the amplitude distortion is observed. Push-pull architecture is proposed for EER RF power amplifiers to cancel distortion components, generated in the nonlinear base-collector capacitance. Push-pull implementation enables a 67 % reduction in phase distortion, accompanied by a 1 - 2 dB reduction in amplitude distortion in EER RF power amplifiers. This work, combined with other studies in the field, will help advance the development of multimode, multiband portable RF transmitters, based on the envelope elimination and restoration architecture.

40|$|International audience—Hardware non-idealities in {{wireless}} <b>transmitter</b> electronics cause <b>distortion</b> {{that is not}} {{captured by}} conventional linear channel models; in fact, error-vector magnitude (EVM) measurements in conformance testing conceptually reduce their collective effect to an additive noise component at each subcarrier. Motivated by the EVM, the present paper considers a 'binoisy' multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model where the additional non-idealities manifest themselves as an additive distortion noise term at the transmit side. Through this extended MIMO relation, the effects of hardware impairments on the achievable rates of different digital modulation schemes are studied via large system analysis.

40|$|Radio {{receivers}} and <b>transmitters</b> produce <b>distortion</b> products {{which are}} {{high above the}} noise floor. These products emanate {{from a combination of}} a low-order nonlinearity and the narrowband nature of the signal of interest. In this work, a scrambling system is proposed that can be added to a receiver, reducing these distortion products. Continuous time-domain signal manipulation is used to spread the spectral power of a narrowband signal, before it passes through nonlinear receiver circuitry. Digitally the original signal shape is reconstructed. This way, the distortion created by the nonlinearity does not result in dominant tones, improving IP 2 and IP 3 figures without increasing the intrinsic circuitry linearity, saving power and maintaining flexibility. This topology became possible through using new designs and topologies, which allow signal manipulation using passive components only. Additionally, a new high speed DAC design allows a voltage supply rail {{to be used as a}} sub-mV accurate reference. The concept is demonstrated using a software-radio approach, in which the sampling and buffering represents the nonlinear processing.

40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), the MR signal intensity can vary spatially and this spatial variation is usually referred to as MR intensity nonuniformity. Although {{the main source of}} intensity nonuniformity arises from B, inhomogeneity of the coil acting as a receiver and/or <b>transmitter,</b> geometric <b>distortion</b> also alters the MR signal intensity. It is useful on some occasions to have these two different sources be separately measured and analyzed. In this paper, we present a practical method for a detailed measurement of the MR intensity nonuniformity. This method is based on the same three-dimensional geometric phantom that was recently developed for a complete measurement of the geometric distortion in MR systems. In this paper, the contribution to the intensity nonuniformity from the geometric distortion can be estimated and thus, it provides a mechanism for estimation of the intensity nonuniformity that reflects solely the spatial characteristics arising from B- 1. Additionally, a comprehensive scheme for characterization of the intensity nonuniformity based on the new measurement method is proposed. To demonstrate the method, the intensity nonuniformity in a 1. 5 T Sonata MR system was measured and is used to illustrate the main features of the method.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for high speed and {{reliable}} wireless communication increases, {{the importance of having}} a linear <b>transmitter</b> has enhanced. <b>Distortions</b> created by the transmitter, such as power amplifier nonlinearity and I/Q imbalance, diminish the fidelity and limit the performance of wireless systems, if left undealt with. Among the techniques commonly used to mitigate these distortions, digital predistortion has established itself as a suitable candidate that minimizes the hardware overhead and only requires modest additional power in the transmitter architecture. An important pre-requisite for utilizing digital predistorters is developing accurate and low complex behavioral models, which is the main focus of this thesis. After analyzing the importance of modeling and compensating for the distortion created by modulators and power amplifiers in the transmitter architecture, an overview of some commonly used models in the literature is presented. A novel behavioral modeling approach is proposed which is capable of modeling long term memory effects in power amplifiers, and a new dual–input modeling approach for I/Q imbalance compensation is presented that successfully compensates for distortion created by the modulator. Compared with conventional and recently proposed techniques, the approaches presented in this thesis show promising results in modeling transmitters accurately. The important issue of computational complexity in behavioral models is also discussed, and the accuracy/compexity tradeoff of some common behavioral models is analyzed. Once behavioral modeling techniques are established, they are used for digital predistortion of wireless transmitters. Issues such as identification of digital predistorters and adaptation of parameters due to changes in power amplifier behavior are discussed and a new measurement testbed to evaluate the performance in parameter adaptation algorithms is proposed. The methods and techniques proposed in this work provide ways to both mitigate distortion in and evaluate performance of wireless transmitters in terms of accuracy and complexity, and can help contribute to a better service of quality in wireless communication systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of electromagnetic fields is dependent {{not only on}} conductivity, but also on magnetic permeability, dielectric permittivity and polarizability, i. e. dispersive conductivity. The long-offset transient electromagnetic (LOTEM) method is mainly {{used to determine the}} spatial distribution of conductivity in the subsurface. However, earlier work on loop-loop TEM suggests that transient EM methods can also be affected by induced polarization (IP). Numerous ID forward calculations were carried out to study the IP effect on LOTEM data, using the Cole-Cole relaxation model to simulate the polarizability of the ground. Besides the polarizability of each layer, the IP effect depends on the LOTEM field set-up and the spatial distribution of conductivity in the ground. In particular, near-surface layers with high chargeabilities can significantly distort the late time transients of the electric field components {{in the vicinity of the}} transmitter. The influence of polarizable layers on the magnetic field components can be neglected under normal circumstances. In 1997 and 1999, LOTEM measurements were carried out at Mt. Vesuvius in Italy to explore the geological structure of the volcano. Sensitivity studies on the effect of polarizable layers suggest that high chargeabilities in connection with conductive layers at greater depths would result in a detectable distortion of the electric field transients. Although the simultaneous IP measurements revealed high chargeabilities in a near-surface layer, no evidence of IP effects could be found in the measured LOTEM data. We conclude that the observed chargeabilities are local and that 3 D effects are probably present in the data. Another aspect is the measurement of the system response, which is usually measured by placing a receiver very close to the <b>transmitter.</b> Therefore, large <b>distortions</b> can be expected if near-surface polarizable layers exist. This was verified in practice by field measurements in an area with high chargeabilities in Longerich, Cologne...|$|R
30|$|Besides the sidelobes {{which are}} {{generated}} {{due to the}} structure of the OFDM <b>transmitter,</b> the signal <b>distortion</b> that is caused by a non-linear transmitter, e.g., the intermodulation distortion (IMD), is indeed another cause of OOBE besides the sidelobes. The IMD reduction techniques are not investigated in our paper since the system is assumed to be linear. However, if the information of the non-linear system is known (for example, the parameters of a non-linear power amplifier), then the current framework could be extended by inserting a ’non-linear system’ module after the ’time-domain approaches’ module in Figure  1. Some of the IMD reduction techniques are similar to the OOBE reduction techniques. For example, coding, selective mapping, and partial transmit sequence methods can be used for both purposes above, which is shown in [26, 27]. Therefore, for these techniques, such an extended framework might be used to jointly reduce the OOBE from sidelobes and IMD. On the other hand, we know that the transmitted signals of large PAPR require the power amplifier to have a large linear range, thus being more likely to generate larger OOBE than the signals of small PAPR. Some of the PAPR reduction methods can be classified in the same way into one of the three groups we proposed for the classification of OOBE suppression techniques. For example, some precoding techniques in [28, 29] can be viewed as the group A techniques that are represented by precoding matrices. The tone injection method in [30] {{can be viewed as a}} group B technique that is represented by symbol mapping. These PAPR reduction techniques above can be combined with the OOBE suppression techniques in our proposed framework to jointly reduce the PAPR and OOBE. However, some other PAPR reduction techniques, such as clipping and companding [31], do not belong to any of the groups and cannot be described by our framework so far. Moreover, some methods reduce the PAPR by distorting the signal, thus increasing the OOBE. It may not be a good idea to implement one of these non-linear methods and an OOBE suppression scheme in one system. In short, to develop an OFDM framework for some more general purpose besides suppressing the OOBE from sidelobes and to develop hybrid techniques for jointly suppressing OOBE from both sidelobes and non-linear distortion are our future work.|$|R
