40|$|The {{amount of}} {{exhausts}} of Sox and Nox from a vessel would be {{equivalent to the}} amount from 50 diesel trucks, and {{the total amount of}} exhausts from LA harbor in U. S. A. is 31. 4 ton/day which equals with the amount from 31 million cars. To regulate these exhausts the Act of POLA (Port Of Los Angeles) Green Port was legislated based on the NEI (No Emission Increase) policy of America, and with the initiation of <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Protocol</b> in Asia the global strategy toward Green Port is being implemented. That is, the demand for electric power supply cable to activate special vessels in port, cranes, and other appurtenant facilities is now explosively increasing with the regulation of oils for big equipment, and along with this trend the ground power supply equipment for AMP (Alternative Maritime Power) Ships is being developed. For the case of maritime vessels the amount of fuel consumption can be reduced by decreasing the weights of machinery and materials. And in this paper, the structural stability and optimal configuration of the ‘Body Frame ’ of ground power supply equipment for ships will be examined through the commercial analytical program...|$|E
