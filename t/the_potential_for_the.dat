5|$|On 6December1961, {{prior to}} the design being {{submitted}} to NATO, {{it was decided that}} the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy. In February1962, the Royal Navy's Admiralty received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy {{was in the process of}} seeking a new interceptor aircraft for use on their aircraft carriers at the time. By March 1962, the Ministry of Defence was openly interested in <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> P.1154 being adopted as a replacement for both the RAF's fleet of Hawker Hunters and the Royal Navy's de Havilland Sea Vixens. Accordingly, in April 1962, a first draft of a new joint Naval/Air Staff requirement was issued in the form of Specification OR356/AW406, to which HSA had submitted a response by June of that year. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention onto working upon this joint requirement.|$|E

Additionally, Jesse M.

5|$|The National Hurricane Center remarked <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> system {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone. An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection. On April 23, the cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear. A Hurricane Hunters flight {{into the system}} confirmed the weakening, and also reported a 1.8°F (1°C) temperature rise in the center, suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics. Early on April 24, the subtropical depression turned eastward, maintaining limited convection. At the time, forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east-northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone. By late on April 24, the system {{was too weak to}} classify using the Dvorak technique, and the NHC ceased issuing advisories. Within 24hours, the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{league to}} enter the American market was {{discussed}} in 1987 when operators of the defunct United States Football League approached the CFL about merging the two leagues.

The Sacramento Gold Miners joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup. The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} route linking Xiamen, in east China's Fujian Province, and Jinmen, in Taiwan {{was closed}} as the typhoon closed in. Chinese officials ordered over 55,000fishing boats {{to return to}} port in Fujian. In Xiamen province north of where Fanapi moved ashore, all kindergarten through middle schools were closed. Across Fujian province, 186,000people evacuated due to the storm. The Fuzhou Changle International Airport in the province's capital city canceled 37flights due to the storm. About 78,000people in low-lying areas of Guangdong left their houses. Oil futures rose in Asia due to <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm affecting China's offshore oil platforms. While Fanapi was still over Taiwan, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the Number 1 Standby Warning and later upgraded it to a warning Number 3 for Hong Kong. The storm ultimately passed about 150km (95mi) north of the territory.|$|E

5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially skeptical about <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Letters to be successful. However, the work {{proved to be}} instantly popular in England {{for a variety of}} reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed {{to become better}} defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E
