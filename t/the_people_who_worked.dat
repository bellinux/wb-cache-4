5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E

25|$|Certain changes {{occurred}} in Europe during {{the end of}} the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century that would greatly affect the lives of the French and the people of Corsica. One of those changes came about {{with the advent of the}} Second Industrial Revolution. With the Second Industrial Revolution, many of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in agriculture began to move to the larger cities with hopes of finding better jobs and better lives. Also, there was a widespread crop failure due to long periods of drought and crop diseases (e.g., the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed the Corsican wine industry), a cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Thus, many of the farms in Corsica began to fail.|$|E

25|$|In the 8th century Arabs {{learned the}} arts of {{papermaking}} from the Chinese and were then the first to bind paper into books {{at the start of}} the Islamic Golden Age. Particular skills were developed for Arabic calligraphy, miniatures and bookbinding. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in making books were called Warraqin or paper professionals. The Arabs made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards, they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. The production of books became a real industry and cities like Marrakech, Morocco, had a street named Kutubiyyin or book sellers, which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century. The famous Koutoubia Mosque is named so because of its location on this street. Because the Qur'an itself was considered a sacred object, in order to beautify the book containing the holy scripture, a culture of calligraphy and lavish bookbinding developed.|$|E

I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E

[...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E

500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying.
