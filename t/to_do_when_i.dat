500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{press release}} also {{revealed}} {{she had worked}} with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed {{when he said he}} had worked on a song with Remi called [...] "Love Is the Greatest" [...] that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only [...] "Motivation" [...] made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. In another interview Rowland told the Daily Star that she had spoken to will.i.am about working on the album and was also keen to get Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs on the album. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Video Phone" [...] by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyoncé, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, [...] "the music that we've done is just hard, it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go in with artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that." [...] Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song [...] "On and On" [...] which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. [...] "On and On" [...] was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album.|$|E
