40|$|Web texts, such as web pages, BBS, or microblogs, usually {{contain a}} great amount of {{real-time}} traffic information, which can be expected to become an important data source for city <b>traffic</b> <b>collection.</b> However, due to the characteristics of ambiguity and uncertainty in the description of traffic condition with natural language, and the difference of description quality for web texts among various publishers and text types, there may exist much inconsistency, or even contradiction for the traffic condition on similar spatial-temporal contexts. An efficient information fusion process is crucial {{to take advantage of the}} mass web sources for real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>collection.</b> In this paper, we propose a traffic state extraction approach from massive web texts based on D-S evidence theory to solve the above problem. Firstly, an evaluation index system for the traffic state information collected from the web texts is built with the help of semantic similarity based on Wikipedia, to eliminate ambiguity. Then, D-S evidence theory is adopted to judge and fuse the extracted traffic state information, with evidence combination and decision, which can solve the problem of uncertainty and difference. An experiment shows that the presented approach can effectively judge the traffic state information contained in massive web texts, and can fully utilize the data from different websites. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is arguably more accurate than the traditional text clustering algorithm. 2013 IEEE...|$|E

Therefore, a novel approach for an efficient and low-cost large-scale traffic monitoring was presented in further proceedings, which augments the Floating Car Data (FCD) principles by an anonymous indirect detection of traffic objects (cars, cyclists, pedestrians) using cars which are equipped with specific radio-based Bluetooth/Wi-Fi receivers.

30|$|<b>Traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> is very {{important}} in transportation applications to assess performance, improve safety and design roads [1]. Before modern powerful computing systems are economically available, traffic engineers or human operators were traditionally deployed in the field for manual <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection.</b> For example, hand-held intersection counter [2] can be used to collect turning traffic volumes at an intersection. However, clearly this manual process is very challenging, time-consuming and costly. For example, when traffic is relatively heavy at an intersection, a traffic engineer {{may not be able to}} simultaneously count volume for all turning directions. In the past two decades, image sensors associated with the ever-increasing power of modern computing systems are increasingly affordable, and hence there has been widespread deployment of camera-based vision systems for traffic monitoring, traffic management, <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection,</b> <b>traffic</b> accident warning, etc. [3, 4, 5, 6]. Among many versatile applications of these camera-based vision systems, one of them is automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection,</b> which can significantly improve efficiency and reduce cost compared to manual data collection.|$|R

30|$|<b>Traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> is {{essential}} for performance assessment, safety improvement and road planning. While automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> for highways is relatively mature, that for roundabouts is more challenging due to more complex traffic scenes, data specifications and vehicle behavior. In this paper, the authors propose an automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> system dedicated to roundabout scenes. The proposed system has mainly four steps of processing. First, camera calibration is performed for roundabout traffic scenes with a novel circle-based calibration algorithm. Second, the system uses enhanced Mixture of Gaussian algorithm with shaking removal for video segmentation, which can tolerate repeated camera displacements and background movements. Then, Kalman filtering, Kernel-based tracking and overlap-based optimization are employed to track vehicles while they are occluded and to derive the complete vehicle trajectories. The resulting vehicle trajectory of each individual vehicle gives the position, size, shape and {{speed of the vehicle}} at each time moment. Finally, a data mining algorithm is used to automatically extract the interested traffic data from the vehicle trajectories. The overall <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> system has been implemented in software and runs on regular PC. The total processing time for a 3 -hour video is currently 6  h. The automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> system can significantly reduce cost and improve efficiency compared to manual data <b>collection.</b> The extracted <b>traffic</b> data have been compared to accurate manual measurements for 29 videos recorded on 29 different days, and an accuracy of more than 90 % has been achieved.|$|R

However, the packet construction mechanism in IEEE 802. 16 / 16 e standard, which was designed for handling traffic solely on a per-connection basis, cannot apply on the relay link directly, as it may render a potential bottleneck and preponderantly limit the overall network capacity. As a solution, we propose two new efficiency-improvement schemes at the MAC layer, namely MPDU concatenation and MSDU aggregation, both of which incarnate the inherent notion of ”aggregation ” and alleviate the dismal efficiency degradation on the relay links. As confirmed by the performance evaluation, the proposed concatenation and aggregation schemes can achieve significant overhead reduction, and thus better prepare the 802. 16 e protocol for its adoption in MMR network.

We start the thesis with an overview of several important considerations for passive Internet <b>traffic</b> <b>collection</b> on large-scale network links.

We propose a method and accompanying metrics to assess routing symmetry on a flow-level based on passive measurements. This method will help to improve traffic analysis techniques.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} deployment and {{usage of}} gigabit networks, traditional networks&#x 2032; intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs) have not scaled accordingly. More recently, {{researchers have been}} looking at hardware-based solutions that use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to assist network IDSs/IPSs, and some proposed systems have been developed that can be scaled to achieve a high speed over 10 Gbps.

30|$|As manual <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> {{is deemed}} {{infeasible}} as discussed above, {{the need for}} automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> for roundabouts arises. Unlike relatively developed systems/tools for automated data collection for highways, those for automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> for roundabouts are relatively scarce in the literature. The most relevant work to automated <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> for roundabouts is those for signalized/un-signalized intersections [5, 6, 19, 20]. In [5, 6], wireless sensors were designed and used for detection of individual vehicle passing similar to how the loop inductor works for detection and counting of highway traffic. A sensor is typically placed close to the stopping line of each lane (but {{in the middle of}} the lane), and a vehicle was detected and recorded when it drove past it. When a vehicle makes a turn, ideally it is first detected by the sensor from the source lane and then by the sensor from the destination lane. In this way, vehicle turning volumes, which are a very desirable type of traffic data for intersections, can be automatically collected. However, the sensor approach has a fundamental algorithm limitation in that a cross-turning (for instance from North to East) may not be distinguished from a right turn (for instance from South to East), which results in inherent counting errors [19]. Besides, the sensor approach may collect only turning volumes, not other types of traffic data such as vehicle speed, waiting time and accepted/rejected gap sizes. If extending the sensor approach for intersections to roundabouts, the situation would be similar that only vehicle volume from entrances/exits may be collected. Therefore, the senor approach for intersections is not considered acceptable for <b>traffic</b> data <b>collection</b> of roundabouts.|$|R
