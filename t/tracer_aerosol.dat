Comparison of the results showed that, although the <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> method suffers {{from some of the}} typical problems of tracer techniques in general (like the need for uniform concentration of the tracer), it gave comparable results with the water vapour balance method, while overcoming the difficulty of the water vapour balance of scaling up from single (or few) plant(s) to whole canopy transpiration. The M 903 Radiance Research portable nephelometer is a lightweight, low-power instrument, and costs about US, 000, while the nebulizer costs less than US, 000. In comparison with the high cost of gas analyzers (up to US, 000 for most CO 2 and N 2 O analyzers) and the additional high costs and unavailability of the tracers, the method offers a cost-effective way of measuring ventilation rates in a greenhouse.

Female SPF F- 344 rats were exposed 6 hrs/day 5 days/week for 3 months to test toner at 0, 10 and 40 mg/m 3. Alveolar clearance of an 85 Sr-polystyrene <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol,</b> and retention of the toner in lungs and lymph nodes were evaluated at the end of exposure and subsequently up to 15 months later. The retained quantity of test toner in the lungs at the end of exposure was 0. 4 and 3 mg for the low and high exposure groups, respectively. 15 months later the corresponding values were 0. 12 and 2. 65 mg in the lungs. The alveolar clearance of the <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> was slightly retarded at the low and substantially impaired at the high exposure level. At the low exposure level, there was some recovery in the slowed clearance behaviour sixmonths post exposure. In contrast, at the high exposure level, there was no indication of a reversal of the im paired clearance. A kinetic model was developed to describe retention of test toner and of labelled particles in the lungs and in the lymph nodes. The assumptions are the following: The lung is divided into two compartments, which contain mobile and immobile macrophages, respectively. Macrophages with a particle burden above a critical volume are immobilized. By chemotaxis the nearest macrophages can migrate into the compartment of immobile macrophages.

40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} provide data for {{evaluating}} the exposure of domestic building occupants to particulate pollutants {{from a variety of}} sources it is necessary to carry out aerosol deposition experiments in real house environments. To complement such studies in real houses, in which many influences on aerosol deposition exist simultaneously, it is desirable to carry out aerosol deposition experiments in test chambers under controlled conditions. An aerosol test chamber, with the dimensions of a small room, is described. The chamber is fitted with air sampling ports so that aerosol deposition velocities can be inferred by monitoring <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentration decay. The use of neutron-activatable aerosol facilitates simultaneous surface sampling. This is not possible with conventional light-scattering aerosol detection techniques and thus provides valuable information on mass transport limited deposition. Aerosol deposition experiments have been carried out, under turbulent conditions using mono-disperse neutron-activatable particles of four sizes. Results are compared with the theory of Corner and Pendlebury (1951, Proc. Phys. Sot. B 64, 645 - 654). Surface sampling has been used to obtain additional information from average aerosol deposition velocities. The potential of the test chamber as a means of assessing the influence of internal building surface character upon aerosol deposition velocity is illustrated...|$|E

The reduced information in the lowest order moments is investigated, in particular, to test for possible analytical relations between these quantities. Detailed results for excess statistics are obtained, such as average level crossing frequencies for varying positions in the plumes, and average excess durations. The results are placed in a framework of theoretical results for turbulent diffusion. Several conditions of atmospheric LIDAR measurements were considered both in fixed and moving center of mass frames of the plumes.

Discrepancies within results of the different receptor models are assessed to be mainly {{due to differences in}} the conceptual hypotheses made for each of them. For instance, the Chemical Mass Balance approach aims at apportioning the whole mass of carbon emitted by primary sources whatever the chemical state of primary organic aerosols (unreacted or reacted), while the Positive Matrix Factorization approach applied to AMS measurements is very likely to treat processed/oxidized primary organic aerosols (OPOA) separately from unreacted POA. Results of source apportionment model intercomparisons thus help better understanding the significance of heterogeneous oxidation processes and traditional secondary organic aerosol formation affecting particles of different origin (local vs. regional). The observation of significant discrepancies in some cases (e. g., high influence of biomass burning emissions) also raises the issue whether source apportionment studies should estimate the remaining unreacted constituents of primary emissions or the amount of particulate matter that are related to both unreacted and processed primary emissions...|$|R

This paper summarizes {{some of the recent}} progress in this field, particularly that driven by the GEOTRACES, and other, international research programmes. The utility and limitations of models used to estimate atmospheric deposition flux, for example, from the surface ocean distribution of tracers such as dissolved aluminium, are discussed and a relatively new technique for quantifying atmospheric deposition using the short-lived radionuclide beryllium- 7 is highlighted. It is proposed that this field will advance more rapidly by using a multi-tracer approach, and that aerosol deposition models should be ground-truthed against observed aerosol concentration data. It is also important to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and rates that control the fractional solubility of these <b>tracers.</b> <b>Aerosol</b> provenance and chemistry (humidity, acidity and organic ligand characteristics) play important roles in governing tracer solubility.

There are various techniques used to scrub the exit gas, such as packed columns, spray scrubbers, fluidised beds, filters, etc. One {{of the key}} design parameters {{required in order to}} select and design a scrubber is the capture efficiency. This efficiency is dependent on a number of factors such as the contacting mode, feed composition and operating conditions.

The experimental technique provides an effective means of generating and capturing the <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> and determination of the overall aerosol capture efficiency. The results show the influence of the superficial gas and particle velocity, bed height, as well as the aerosol concentration, on the overall capture efficiency. Three possible predictive methods are considered to describe or quantify the aerosol capture efficiency. These are a capture parameter based on the available surface area, a capture parameter based on dimensionless groupings, and a dispersion model based on aerosol particle filtration by fixed bed porous filters. Each method is applied to the experimental data to determine their effectiveness in describing the capture in the granular moving bed.

40|$|The {{use of a}} <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> with a {{bulk density}} close to that of air is a {{convenient}} way to study the dispersal of pollutants in ambient room air flow. Conventional point measurement techniques do not permit the rapid and accurate determination of the concentration fields produced by the injection of such a tracer into a volume of air. An instantaneous two dimensional distribution would aid in the characterization of flow and diffusion processes in the volume studied, and permit verification of theoretical models. A method is developed to measure such two dimensional concentration fields using a laser light sheet to illuminate the plane of interest, which is captured and processed using current microcomputer-based video image acquisition and analysis technology. Point concentrations, determined optically using extinction of monochromatic illumination projected through the aerosol onto a photo detector, are used to calibrate the captured video linages to detennine actual concentration values. Accuracy, reproducibility, and maximum rate of data acquisition are evaluated by means of theoretical models of ambient air flow in a sealed box with pointinjection of the tracer, and in a duct of circular cross section with constant air velocity under both constant and pulsed injection scenarios. by Frank Revi.

40|$|A package {{has been}} {{developed}} for calculating analytic expressions for forces and torques onto an arbitrarily shaped convex <b>tracer</b> (<b>aerosol)</b> particle small compared to the mean free path of the surrounding nonequilibrium gas. The package Phoretic allows to compute analytical (and also numerical) expressions for forces and torques stemming from elastic and diffusive scattering processes parameterized by an accommodation coefficient. The method is based on calculating half-sphere integral tensors of arbitrary rank and on integrating forces and torques acting on surface elements. The surrounding gas is completely specified by an arbitrarily shaped velocity distribution function. Accordingly, Phoretic requires two inputs: A particle (surface) geometry and a velocity distribution function. For example, the particle may be a cylinder with flat end caps, and the distribution function the one of Maxwell (isotropic) or Grad (13 th moment approximation). The package reproduces analytic results for spheres which were available in the literature, and the ones for other geometries (cylinders, cuboids, ellipsoids) which were, however, only partially available (some works considered only elastic collisions, others temperature, or pressure, or only velocity gradients, etc.). In addition, Phoretic takes into account angular velocities which have been usually neglected and become relevant for non-spherical particles. The package is geared towards the implementation of dynamical equations for aerosol particles suspended in dilute or semidilute gases and as such helps to obtain concentration profiles and mobilities of aerosol particles depending on their shape (distribution) and environmental conditions...|$|E

Respirations of <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosols</b> of 1 µm at a flow rate of 30 L/min were simulated, with exhaled distributions recorded at the mouth. Large eddy simulations and a Lagrangian tracking approach were used to simulate respiratory airflows and aerosol dynamics. Aerosol morphometric measures such as concentration disparity, spatial distributions, and fractal analysis were applied to distinguish various exhaled aerosol patterns. Utilizing physiology-based modeling, we demonstrated substantial differences in exhaled aerosol distributions among normal and pathological airways, which were suggestive of the disease location and extent. With fractal analysis, we also demonstrated that exhaled aerosol patterns exhibited fractal behavior in both the entire image and selected regions of interest. Each exhaled aerosol fingerprint exhibited distinct pattern parameters such as spatial probability, fractal dimension, lacunarity, and multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, a correlation of the diseased location and exhaled aerosol spatial distribution was established for asthma.

The effect of guaiphenesin (administered as Robitussin 1) on mucociliary clearance has been assessed in 15 subjects from the rate of removal from the lung of previously inhaled radioactive tracer particles. The guaiphenesin was compared with a positive control preparation consisting of the guaiphenesin vehicle only in two double-blind crossover trials. The first trial examined eight aged `healthy' volunteer subjects and the second trial examined seven chronic bronchitic patients. Sequential gamma counts were made from the whole lung by scintillation counters for 6 hours after inhalation and the chest was also scanned rectilinearly. In the first 5 hours after inhalation the mean rate of removal of particles and therefore of secretions was faster after guaiphenesin than after the control preparation. This difference was not statistically significant in the healthy volunteers but achieved significance (P < 0 · 05) in the chronic bronchitic patients. Lung scans after inhaling the <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> indicated that on average the initial penetration of the particles into the lung was similar in the guaiphenesin and control runs.

40|$|One way of {{administrating}} pharmaceutical {{drugs in}} the development phase and in the clinical situation is by inhalation. It is essential to ensure an accurate delivered dose, as the prediction of the effect and side effects of the drug action is dependent on a precise estimation of the given dose. During inhalation as compared to other techniques (oral or intravenous) this becomes more complicated as the dose is dependent on device performance and patient interaction during inhalation, both which influence the site of deposition which can be of interest for specific drug applications. This thesis will try to {{explain some of the}} main underlying factors involved, and how to control, or measure, the effect of them in order to achieve a more accurate dosing to patients. Initially six different commercially available nebulisers were investigated {{in order to try to}} explain the nebuliser droplet generation and separation properties. The results obtained in this study indicate that the mass median diameters (MMD) of the investigated nebulisers were dependent on air velocity, and the ratio of liquid to air volumetric flow rate (QI/Qa). It was also found that changes in air velocity affects QI/Qa, and both air velocity and QI/Qa separately influence the size distribution and thus the output A novel inhalation system, called FIDO, was developed to enable a more accurate estimate of the inhaled dose than previously used methods. The data obtained supports the hypothesis that FIDO is more accurate in delivering and estimating a predefined inhaled dose compared to conventional indirect filter methods used today. The effect of turbulence on regional deposition of Evans Blue dye <b>tracer</b> <b>aerosol</b> in normal and constricted airways was investigated using an animal (rabbit) model. This was achieved by using different aerosol carrier gases consisting of either Helium-Oxygen (80 % He/ 20 % 02) or air (79 % N 2 / 21 % 02) in histamine-provoked and non-provoked rabbits. The results showed that bronchial provocation gave more central deposition (0. 55 ± 0. 11 expressed as ratio central/total deposition) compared to the non-provoked control group (0. 80 ± 0. 09). The He-O 2 ventilated rabbits also had a significantly higher peripheral deposition compared with air ventilated rabbits when provoked. The effect of the relative humidity of entrained ambient air on nebulised aerosol size properties was assessed in a study where two jet nebuliser designs were investigated using the proposed CEN standard. The first one was a conventional constant output nebuliser, the second one a breath enhanced nebuliser. The study showed a droplet size distribution dependency related to the relative humidity (RH) of the entrained air when using the conventional nebuliser, an effect which was not apparent for the breath enhanced nebuliser. An inhalation study using sodium chromoglycate was performed on light to moderate asthmatic children. The effect on deposition was investigated by changing the droplet size distribution inhaled through alteration of the relative humidity (RH) (low RH corresponding to 13 % and a high RH corresponding to > 90 % RH) of the entrained air. The droplet size was monitored with an impactor and was found to be 1. 2 mm for the low RH and 2. 0 mm for the high RH. A difference in the total deposition between the low and high RH, 34 % and 41 % respectively, was found. The results were compared with the results obtained by a lung deposition software, TGLD 2, developed at Karolinska Institute. The software could differentiate between lung and extrathorasic deposition and could explain the difference in the total deposition obtained at different RH. The study also showed a correlation between the tidal volume inhaled and the total amount deposited. There was also a correlation between the RH (e. g. droplet size) and the amount deposited...|$|E

Consequently, there is a critical need to understand variability of aerosol beta at 2. 1 micrometers, to evaluate signal detection under varying aerosol loading conditions. Although few direct measurements of beta at 2. 1 micrometers exist, extensive datasets, including climatologies in widely-separated locations, do exist for other wavelengths based on CO 2 and Nd:YAG lidars. Datasets also exist for the associated microphysical and chemical properties. An example of a multi-parametric dataset is that of the NASA GLObal Backscatter Experiment (GLOBE) in 1990 in which aerosol chemistry and size distributions were measured concurrently with multi-wavelength lidar backscatter observations. More recently, continuous-wave (CW) lidar backscatter measurements at mid-infrared wavelengths have been made during the Multicenter Airborne Coherent Atmospheric Wind Sensor (MACAWS) experiment in 1995.

About half of the emitted mass of <b>aerosol</b> <b>tracers</b> with an ambient diameter Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 1. 0 ÃÂ¼m is typically deposited in regions more than 1000 km away from the source. Furthermore, using the KÃÂ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification to categorize the sources into various climate classes we find substantial differences in the deposition potential between these classes. Tracers originating in arid regions show the largest remote deposition potentials, with values more than doubled compared to the smallest potentials from tracers in tropical regions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions lead to variations in the remote deposition potentials. On average the remote deposition potentials in summer correspond to about 70 Ã¢ÂÂ 80 % of the values in winter, with a large spread among the climate classes. For tracers from tropical regions the summer remote deposition values are only about 31 % of the winter values, while they are about 95 % for tracers from arid regions...|$|R
40|$|Volume-scanning elastic {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{as a means to}} derive 3 D dynamic wind fields for characterization and monitoring of wind energy sites. An eye-safe volume-scanning lidar system was adapted for volume imaging of aerosol concentrations out to a range of 300 m. Reformatting of the lidar data as dynamic volume images was successfully demonstrated. A practical method for deriving 3 D wind fields from dynamic volume imagery was identified and demonstrated. However, the natural phenomenology was found to provide insufficient aerosol features for reliable wind sensing. The results of this study may be applicable to wind field measurement using injected <b>aerosol</b> <b>tracers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Biosafety Level 3 (BL- 3) {{laboratories}} {{are designed}} to prevent the escape of pathogenic microorganisms by operating at negative pressure so that if microorganisms become airborne, they remain within the laboratory. However, the authors {{are not aware of}} any published evidence or international guidance on the level of pressure differential required for BL- 3 laboratories. This uncertainty was reflected in a survey of BL- 3 laboratories in the United Kingdom where a range of pressure differentials between 30 and 100 Pascals (Pa) were found. In this paper, an attempt is made to address this issue. The authors have developed techniques to quantify the effectiveness of containment laboratories in preventing the egress of airborne microorganisms. A potassium iodide (KI) <b>aerosol</b> <b>tracer</b> method was adapted to measure the degree of containment in an experimental facility and in five working BL- 3 laboratories. The level of laboratory containment was expressed as the laboratory protection factor (LPF). Using this technique, it was found that providing an anteroom increased the LPF by approximately one order of magnitude. No direct relationship was found between the magnitude of negative pressure and LPF. There was, however, a direct relationship between inflow velocity and LPF: A volumetric inflow of 10 m 3 /min into a laboratory through an anteroom gave a LPF of greater than 10 5. The KI <b>aerosol</b> <b>tracer</b> method offers a simple and appropriate means of validating the performance of BL- 3 laboratories in terms of the LPF...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Levels of {{particulate}} matter fraction PM 10 were monitored between 2009 and 2011 in Malaga (Spain) {{in one of}} the Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring network managed by the Environmental Health Service of the Andalusian Government. Long-term measurements of cosmogenic radionuclides such as 7 Be provide important data in studying global atmospheric processes and comparing environmental impact of radioactivity from man-made sources to natural ones. 7 Be is a natural radionuclide <b>tracer</b> of <b>aerosols</b> originated over a range of high altitudes in the atmosphere. On the other hand, 210 Pb is produced by radioactive decay from its progenitor, 222 Rn, which emanates primarily from land surface. Therefore, 210 Pb in the air is an effective tracer of the continental surface air mass. The variation of the data with time was studied by time series analyses and seasonal patterns were identified. The study of air back-trajectories were computed by means of the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories (HYSPLIT) trajectory model (Draxler, 1994) using meteorological data supplied by the US National Climatic Data Centr...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Organosulfates are {{important}} secondary organic aerosol (SOA) components and good <b>tracers</b> for <b>aerosol</b> heterogeneous reactions. However, {{the knowledge of}} their spatial distribution, formation conditions, and environmental impact is limited. In this study, we report two organosulfates, an isoprene-derived isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) (2, 3 -epoxy- 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -butanediol) sulfate and a glycolic acid (GA) sulfate, measured using the NOAA Particle Analysis Laser Mass Spectrometer (PALMS) on board the NASA DC 8 aircraft over the continental U. S. during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment (DC 3) and the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC 4 RS). During these campaigns, IEPOX sulfate was estimated to account for 1. 4 % of submicron aerosol mass (or 2. 2 % of organic aerosol mass) on average near {{the ground in the}} southeast U. S., with lower concentrations in the western U. S. (0. 2 – 0. 4 %) and at high altitudes (< 0. 2 %). Compared to IEPOX sulfate, GA sulfate was mor...|$|R

Particles emitted from jet aircraft are relatively ineffective as cloud droplet condensation nuclei (less than 1 percent) compared with those from forest fires (above 50 percent). Chemical and other modification during aging of the particles may influence these results in some circumstances; cloud nucleating properties {{can be used as}} a soot <b>tracer.</b> Such <b>aerosols,</b> as they grow to haze drops and ilute in increasing humidity, may form ice particles in the cold polar stratosphere or in tropical cumuli anvils at 18 to 20 km altitude at temperatures as low as - 90 C. Ice may also form as particles are removed by descent through troposphere folds and enter midlatitude cirrus at levels below - 40 C. In the stratosphere, ice particles may provide surfaces that catalyze heterogeneous chemical reactions; in the upper troposphere, the optical depths of cirrus clouds may be significantly increased...|$|R

Ground-based equipments have {{to be used for}} the validation of the satellite retrievals, particularly when there are clouds in the observed pixels. The SPATRAM (SPectrometer for Atmospheric <b>TRacers</b> and <b>Aerosol</b> Measurement) is a UV-Vis spectrometer allowing for the measurements of spectral sky radiance along the zenith direction, in its standard configuration. This equipment is installed at the CGE observatory at Évora, in south of Portugal. The application of Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy methodology to the measured raw data, allows for the retrieval of the total column content of several traces gases. The mid-latitudes atmosphere is a complex region of our planet, where air masses coming from lower and higher latitudes meet, essentially, to balance the temperature gradient. The study {{of the relationship between the}} Polar Regions and the mid-latitudes is well developed nowadays, due to the polar ozone loss. On the other hand the interaction between tropics and mid-latitude regions still remains insufficiently understood. Stratospheric ozone is continuously subordinated to chemical processes of creation and destruction by chemically active compounds as chlorofluorocarbons, and also from othe...|$|R
