5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> {{is as good as}} any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later Brock {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison were planning to imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> of the guard to disarm and had him confined.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{close to}} <b>the</b> <b>sergeant's</b> eyes, {{and saw that}} he was understood. At once he removed his hand, and untied the belt which {{fastened}} <b>the</b> <b>sergeant's</b> feet.|$|R
60|$|It was not {{the boys}} and girls, only, who were <b>the</b> <b>sergeant's</b> patrons. Picture books were scarce in those days, and grown-up girls and young men were not ashamed to pay their pennies to peep into <b>the</b> <b>sergeant's</b> box.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sergeants</b> Puttock and Ravenshaw arrest Pieboard for {{outstanding}} debts owed to his landlady. Pieboard tells <b>the</b> <b>sergeants</b> {{that he was}} on his way to collect five pounds from a Gentleman for a masque he has just written. He promises that, if they allow him to go to the Gentleman's house to collect the money, he will pay off all of his outstanding debts and give them whatever money remains of the five pounds. <b>The</b> <b>sergeants</b> agree to accompany Pieboard to the Gentleman's house.|$|R
5|$|In the U.S. Marine Corps, {{sergeant}} major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in grade to master gunnery sergeant, {{although the two}} have different responsibilities. A {{sergeant major}} typically serves as the unit commander's senior enlisted adviser and to handle matters of discipline and morale among the enlisted Marines. <b>The</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Major of the Marine Corps is chosen by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to serve as his adviser and is the preeminent and highest ranking enlisted Marine with a protocol equivalency of a lieutenant general.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Major of the Marine Corps is {{selected}} by the Commandant of the Marine Corps and typically serves a four-year term, though his service is {{at the discretion of}} the Commandant. Since Sergeant Major Wilbur Bestwick was appointed the first Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in 1957, 17 different Marines have filled this post.|$|E
5|$|These {{sessions}} {{of the legislature}} designated Oregon City as the official capital and introduced income and property taxes that replaced an 1843 subscription program used to finance the government's activities. Other business included a ban on hard liquor, the incorporation of Oregon City, approval for the Barlow Road around Mount Hood, incorporation of the Multnomah Circulating Library, and incorporation of the Oregon Institute. At the meetings John E. Long served as the recorder, Frederick Prigg as the clerk, a Mr. Shaw as <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> at arms, and two people as chaplains.|$|E

5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload {{a large number of}} cases before the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Mount Tabor High School for 9th and 10th {{grade and}} then completed {{his last two}} years at Richard J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem, graduating in 1983. In high school, he was a captain of his football team, ran track, served as Vice President of the Student Council, and was <b>the</b> <b>Sergeant</b> at Arms of the school's Key Club. Scott {{was inducted into the}} Richard J. Reynolds High School Hall of Fame during a ceremony on February 6, 2015, which took place during the Reynolds/Mt. Tabor (the two high schools that Scott attended) basketball game.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before <b>the</b> <b>Sergeant</b> at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E

5|$|With these changes, {{a special}} session of the {{legislature}} met August 5 until August 20 in Oregon City. On August 11, 1845 at the introduction of Jesse Applegate the body passed a law against dueling within a half hour that Governor Abernethy also signed within 30 minutes of the bill's introduction. A new legislature met beginning on December 2, with Robert Newell serving as {{the speaker of the}} body through December 10 and Henry A. G. Lee assuming the post until the conclusion of the session on December 19. Polk District was created during the session, with the bill passed on December 19. John E. Long served as the recorder and Theophilus R. Magruder as <b>the</b> <b>sergeant</b> at arms for the group. The same people who served in the summer session also served in the December session.|$|E
5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{decorated}} United States Army combat soldiers of World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945. He received every American combat award for valor available at the time of his service, including the Medal of Honor. He also received recognitions from France and Belgium. With his 1945 military discharge at the end of the war, Murphy became an advocate of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio and <b>the</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Audie Murphy Clubs (SAMC) on military bases honor his contributions. He joined the Texas National Guard in 1950, transferring to reserve status in 1956 and remaining in the Guard until 1969. He also had a civilian career as a film actor and songwriter. Recognitions he received both during his lifetime and posthumously are listed below.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} in Swansea for another year, {{working in the}} local steelworks whilst playing local football, until Swansea Town manager Haydn Green visited Ford's home. Green had taken over Swansea in 1939 and had set about establishing the side as a feeder club for local youth talent {{due to a lack}} of finances, offering 17 year old Ford an amateur contract in 1940 before signing him to his first professional contract with Swansea two years later. With the Football League suspended due to the Second World War, Ford featured for the club in wartime Combination leagues. Having spent his youth career as a defender, during his war service, Ford grew substantially in both height and weight and <b>the</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Major in charge of the local army football side switched him to centre-forward where he flourished, scoring 41 times between 1945 and 1946 in regional wartime competitions. After he was moved from his original army posting in Rhyl to new barracks in Colchester, Ford appeared for Leyton Orient in wartime fixtures, scoring three times in four appearances for the side. Following the return of league football after wartime, he made his fully professional competitive debut and played sixteen times in the first half of the 1946–47 season for the Swans in the Second Division before moving to Aston Villa in January 1947 for a fee of £9,500 plus Tommy Dodds.|$|E

5|$|Hispanics {{are more}} highly {{represented}} among enlisted {{personnel in the}} Marine Corps than in the other services. On June 27, 2003, Sergeant Major John L. Estrada, originally from the nation of Trinidad and Tobago, became the 15th sergeant major of the United States Marine Corps and the first person of Hispanic descent promoted to that rank. Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is a unique non-commissioned rank in the United States Marine Corps. The holder of this rank and post is the senior enlisted member of the Marine Corps. Estrada enlisted on September 19, 1973, and has been assigned to various units and positions during the years which he served. From December 2001 to May 2003, Estrada served as <b>the</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Major, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this assignment, he was forward deployed and participated in Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. His personal awards include the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with three gold stars, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. On April 25, 2007, SgtMaj Estrada stepped down from his post as Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps.|$|E
