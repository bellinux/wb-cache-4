5|$|As of 2004, {{the highest}} number of <b>Togolese</b> {{participating}} at any one Games was seven at the nation's debut games in 1972. As of the 2004 Games, Togo had not yet won a medal. The first medal was won by Benjamin Boukpeti at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{purchased}} by the wife of the <b>Togolese</b> Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium. The plane was converted and re-opened as a restaurant on 11 November 2013 as a public-private partnership between the Ghana Airport Company Limited and Vindira Company Limited. It {{is the first time that}} a plane based restaurant has opened in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The sole female <b>Togolese</b> athlete at the 2004 Games, Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni, {{competed in}} the 400 metres. She ran in the fifth heat on 21 August, {{finishing}} {{in a time of}} 52.87 seconds in seventh position. This was only ahead of Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Dharsha (54.58 seconds), but was outside the time of Mireille Nguimgo from Cameroon (51.90 seconds), who was the slowest qualifier from the heat. Thiébaud-Kangni did not progress to the following round.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Togolese</b> {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} canoeist Boukpeti competing in the men's K-1. This was his debut at an Olympic Games, although he would later return for both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Boukpeti had competed for France as a junior, but switched allegiance in adulthood to Togo since his father was born there. Boukpeti had only ever visited the country once, as a child. Boukpeti had changed his national allegiance {{in order to make}} Olympic qualification easier. He was the only competitor for an African national at the 2004 Games in the events held at the Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The sole <b>Togolese</b> canoeist, Benjamin Boukpeti {{competed in}} the men's K-1 competition. He {{competed in the}} {{qualifying}} round on 19 August, finishing in 9th place during the first run {{with a time of}} 96.99 seconds. He finished his second run in 101.93 seconds, placing him in 21st place. This gave him an overall total of 198.92 seconds, which put him in 15th place. Since the top 20 finishers qualified for the semi-final, Boukpeti made his way into the next round. There was a single run for the semi-final on 20 August, with Boukpeti's time of 102.42 seconds resulting in him finishing in 18th position out of the 20 canoeists. This was ahead of Pierpaolo Ferrazzi of Italy (103.07 seconds) and Switzerland's Michael Kurt (103.20 seconds). Only the top ten competitors qualified for the final, ending Boukpeti's competition.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, Razak, {{who had become}} a player-coach while at Al Ain, started his coaching career, being in charge of several semi-professional <b>Togolese</b> clubs, before moving to Benin's AS Dragons FC de l'Ouémé.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{committed}} to sending an additional five billion CFA francs {{at a meeting}} with the <b>Togolese</b> government on 22 January 2010, and it announced on 1 February that it would have 122 observers present for the election.|$|E
25|$|Togo {{opened its}} Embassy in New Delhi in October 2010. The High Commission of India in Accra, Ghana is {{concurrently}} accredited to Togo. <b>Togolese</b> President Gnassingbé Eyadéma made an official state visit to India in September 1994. During the visit, {{the two countries}} agreed to establish Joint Commission.|$|E
25|$|For export business, {{only the}} fishing village of Beninese and <b>Togolese</b> origin {{serves as a}} port. Yet the laying of the first stone for the {{construction}} of a deep water port dates from 1975, under the chairmanship of Omar Bongo. Until today this work is still not out of the ground and the inhabitants are still waiting, because its viability is not obvious.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the democratization}} {{process of the}} early 1990s, which proved largely abortive, Eyadema and his ruling party, the Rally of the <b>Togolese</b> People (RPT), {{successively}} won all presidential elections, although those elections were always extremely controversial: the opposition boycotted the 1993 presidential election altogether, and it claimed that Eyadema won the 1998 presidential election and the 2003 presidential election only through fraud. Eyadema died in 2005 and his son Faure Gnassingbé then ran as the RPT candidate; although he officially won the election, the opposition again disputed the result, and serious violence erupted.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Yeaten {{lived in}} Lomé, Togo, and {{although}} he allegedly was still protected by Gnassingbé, the <b>Togolese</b> President came under increasing international pressure to extradite Yeaten {{so that he could}} be prosecuted in Liberia. Meanwhile, Yeaten began to covertly form a unit of over 200 mercenaries in Liberia, recruited from NPFL and ULIMO ex-fighters. With this unit he resurfaced in December 2016 in the Gambia, reportedly hired by President Jammeh to protect him in case of an invasion of ECOWAS to depose him. In the end, the crisis ended peacefully; it is assumed that Yeaten consequently returned to Togo.|$|E
25|$|The Council lost {{popularity}} with the Kutuklui Affair. By decree of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{and the rest}} of the council, <b>Togolese</b> opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on October 27, 1971, where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General Etienne Eyadema, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema's military government. The Council's decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in Cotonou. Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the Affair.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on 11 March, Gilbert Bawara, the Minister of Cooperation, criticized Fabre. He said that Fabre should not expect the <b>Togolese</b> people to trust him {{when he did not}} trust others, and he argued that Fabre's claims of victory were ridiculous, noting that Fabre initially claimed a score of 7580% but later claimed a lesser figure of 5560%. According to Bawara, Gnassingbé would consider the fact that Fabre had received a respectable number of votes; Bawara observed that Fabre's score of 34% was particularly impressive because he had not been envisioned as a presidential candidate before January 2010. However, he also said that Fabre lacked experience and did not do serious work in the National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the 2010 election, the <b>Togolese</b> {{government}} {{took steps to}} increase {{the credibility of the}} electoral process and reassure the international community that the election would be free and fair. It placed a particular priority on avoiding the violence that marred the 2005 election. Gnassingbé stood for a second term as the candidate of the RPT, while the UFC designated Fabre as its candidate due to health problems suffered by its President, Gilchrist Olympio. Although the UFC was the largest opposition party by a large measure, and although the election was to be decided in a single round on a first past the post basis, the other opposition parties largely refused to rally behind Fabre and chose to nominate their own candidates.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on 24 April. It is marked by much violence, resulting in dozens of deaths. The results were proclaimed on 26 April: Faure Gnassingbé, wins the election with 60.22% of the votes, before Emmanuel Bob Akitani with 38.19% and Harry Olympio with 0.55%. After the announcement, there was an outbreak of demonstrations in several cities of the country, denouncing the massive fraud. Clashes between demonstrators and the police occurred, involving hundreds of victims, died or wounded. Thousands of <b>Togolese</b> took refuge in Benin. ECOWAS, the European Union and France recognized the victory of Faure Gnassingbé Eyadema and called for the installation of a government of national unity. This {{was rejected by the}} radical opposition, that requested the cancellation of the elections because of the massive fraud.|$|E
25|$|Olympio had {{considered}} {{the military to}} be unnecessary {{in his efforts to}} develop and modernize the country and kept the military force small (only about 250 soldiers). However, as a result, troops who had left the French Army to return to their home in Togo were not provided with enlistment in the limited Togo military. Emmanuel Bodjolle and Kléber Dadjo, the leaders in the Togo military, repeatedly tried to get Olympio to increase funding and enlist more of the ex-French army troops returning to the country, but were unsuccessful. On 24 September 1962, Olympio rejected the personal plea by Étienne Eyadéma, a Sergent in the French military, to join the <b>Togolese</b> military. On 7 January 1963, Dadjo again presented a request for enlisting ex-French troops and Olympio reportedly tore up the request.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI). The 17 members of CENI were sworn in on 1 September 2009; it was composed of five representatives of the ruling Rally of the <b>Togolese</b> People (RPT), five representatives of the parliamentary opposition, three representatives of the extra-parliamentary opposition, three representatives of civil society, and one representative of the administration. Henri Kolani, {{a representative of the}} extra-parliamentary opposition, was then elected as President of CENI, but the parliamentary opposition objected to his election. At a press conference on 18 September 2009, Kolani announced an electoral schedule: preparations for the election would begin in October 2009, the official election campaign period would run from 13 to 26 February 2010, and the election would be held on 28 February 2010. He stressed that hard work was necessary to ensure that the {{election was}} held before the constitutional deadline. The parliamentary opposition ignored Kolani's announcement.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 <b>Togolese</b> coup d'état was a {{military}} coup {{that occurred in the}} country of Togo on 13 January 1963. The coup leaders (notably Emmanuel Bodjolle, Étienne Eyadéma and Kléber Dadjo) took over government buildings, arrested most of the cabinet, and assassinated Togo's first President, Sylvanus Olympio outside the American embassy in Lomé. The coup leaders quickly brought Nicolas Grunitzky and Antoine Meatchi, both of whom were exiled political opponents of Olympio, together to form a new government. While the government of Ghana and its President Kwame Nkrumah were implicated in the coup and assassination of Olympio, full investigation was never completed and the international outcry eventually died down. The event was important as the first coup d'état in the French and British colonies of Africa that achieved independence in the 1950s and 1960s, and Olympio is remembered {{as one of the first}} heads of state to be assassinated during {{a military}} coup in Africa.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Olympio {{became an}} active leader in {{pursuing}} independence for Togo from French rule. His political party boycotted the territorial assembly elections throughout the 1950s because of French interference in those elections (including the 1956 election that made Nicolas Grunitzky, {{the brother of}} Olympio's wife, the Prime Minister of the French colony) and Olympio made repeated pleas to the United Nations (UN) to assist in resolution of the country's claims for independence (Olympio's petition to the UN in 1947 was the first official petition for UN resolution of a dispute). In the 1958 election, despite French interference, Olympio's party (the Comité de l'unité togolaise) swept the elections defeating Grunitzky's party (the <b>Togolese</b> Progress Party) and the French named Olympio the Prime Minister of the colony. Olympio's victory triggered a significant realignment of French colonial policy and resulted {{in a series of}} independence plebiscites throughout colonies in French West Africa. Olympio spearheaded the passing of a new constitution for Togo by popular vote in 1961 and became the first president of Togo with an election victory of over 90% of the vote. After this significant victory {{and as a result of}} repression following an attempt on Olympio's life in 1961, Togo largely became a one-party state at independence.|$|E
500|$|The Togo women's {{national}} football team (...) represents the <b>Togolese</b> Republic in women's inter{{national football}} competition since 2006. Togo is {{managed by the}} Fédération Togolaise de Football (FTF), the governing body of football in Togo. The team only played five FIFA-recognised matches, in 2006 and 2007. Their current manager is Paul Zoungbede. Togo's home stadium is the Stade de Kégué, located in Lomé.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Alley allowed <b>Togolese</b> refugee Noe Kutuklui {{protection}} in Dahomey, despite official government policy to the contrary. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized {{power in a}} coup. He ended Alley's military career, {{as well as that}} of every other senior officer, and named him commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. He was released on amnesty on August 1, 1984, as well as all other political detainees besides those involved in the [...] "ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of Sunday, January 16, 1967," [...] as the official press release states.|$|E
2500|$|An {{offshoot}} of the FLEC claimed responsibility. Rodrigues Mingas, {{secretary general of the}} Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (Flec-PM), said his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. [...] "This attack was not aimed at the <b>Togolese</b> players but at the Angolan forces {{at the head of the}} convoy", Mingas told France24 television. [...] "So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don't have anything to do with the <b>Togolese</b> and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for the total liberation of Cabinda." ...|$|E
2500|$|... : President Faure Gnassingbé said in {{a message}} to King Philippe: [...] "I want to you to express my indignation and my {{condemnation}} of these heinous attacks and to share the deep compassion and solidarity of the <b>Togolese</b> people." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Bumbea's death, Dresnok {{married his}} third wife, the {{daughter}} of a North Korean woman and a <b>Togolese</b> diplomat. They had a son, Tony, in 2001. The family lived in a small apartment in Pyongyang, provided along with a monthly stipend by the North Korean government. Dresnok was in failing health, with a bad heart and liver (Dresnok described his liver as [...] "full of fat"), which he attributed to smoking and drinking too much.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} council {{never got}} started {{and only a}} few meetings were held between the three leaders. Tensions increased between the members in 1963 with the 1963 <b>Togolese</b> coup d'état: Nkrumah was accused of having supported the coup. In the preparation for the Addis Ababa summit to found the Organization of African Unity, Touré was upset with Nkrumah for pursuing an agenda without consultation of the other members. [...] The union was dissolved without much attention in May 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Beleaguer (or Agbéluvhoé or Agbeluwoe), {{also known}} as the Battle of Tsewie, was fought during the First World War between invading British Empire {{soldiers}} of the West African Rifles and German troops in German Togoland (now Togo) on 15 August 1914. British troops at the <b>Togolese</b> capital Lomé on the coast, had advanced towards a wireless station at Kamina, [...] inland on hills near Atakpame. The only routes inland were by the railway and road, which had been built through dense and almost impassable jungle.|$|E
2500|$|Reacting to the Constitutional Court's {{decision}} to validate his candidacy, UFC Secretary-General Fabre {{said that it}} was [...] "unquestionably a message of hope for the <b>Togolese</b> people who aspire to a profound change". He also stressed that Olympio [...] "embodies, more than any other, the ideals and values of our party" [...] and that his own candidacy represented a commitment to continuing Olympio's work. Seeking to give the impression of solidarity amidst perceptions of internal disagreement, UFC First Vice-President Patrick Lawson said that the party was totally united behind Fabre's candidacy.|$|E
2500|$|This {{innovative}} practice Asmis {{referred to}} as [...] "Bezirksleiterrecht" [...] (or [...] "the law conducted by district officials"), and he also attempted to codify traditional laws of <b>Togolese</b> societies for the use by District officers. However his superiors back in Berlin viewed his actions as too innovative and too risky, given the political ramifications and called a stop to Asmis' work on codification in 1908. In a letter the German Governor Count von Zech, Colonial Secretary Bernhard Dernburg noted that Asmis' attempts at tribal law codification were [...] "totally unfeasible" [...] and [...] "were designed to demolish the whole colonial effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bryant was {{surprised}} by the sudden German retreat, having estimated the German force to be [...] and three machine-guns and assumed that the defenders had tried to forestall the cutting of their retreat by a wider flanking movement or that the French advance from Cheti had been discovered and the Germans had chosen to concentrate at Kamina. A storm had cut telegraph communications with Accra for three days and unknown to Bryant, British signallers eavesdropping on German wireless communications had learned that they had destroyed their ciphers, which suggested that they considered the situation desperate. The Germans had amassed one colonial and eight <b>Togolese</b> companies, which had been expected to be much more formidable and to fight in the entrenchments and dug-outs around Kamina. The German intelligence system had broken down when the war began and no news had been brought from the Gold Coast, due to lack of co-operation from <b>Togolese</b> civilians. Communication with Berlin resulted only in exhortations to protect the wireless at Kamina. The speed of the Allied invasion, the German overestimation of the numbers involved and the hostility of local civilians, proved to be insuperable obstacles. A German account noted that many of the Germans were untrained, that the defences of Kamina were too widespread for the German force adequately to garrison and were overlooked by nearby hills. The British had been helped by the quick action of the French civilian and military authorities, the endurance of the troops and the assistance from civilians in the Gold Coast.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between the}} {{countries}} of Ghana and Togo (and between Nkrumah and Olympio) became very tense in 1962 with repeated assassination plots. Assassination attempts on both leaders were blamed on the other. Refugees and political dissidents from Ghana found refuge in Togo, while political dissidents from Togo found refuge in Ghana. After the <b>Togolese</b> Progress Party and the Juvento movement were implicated in a 1961 attempt on Olympio's life, many prominent politicians including Nicolas Grunitzky and Antoine Meatchi left the country and received welcome and support from Ghana. Similarly, political dissidents from Ghana had fled to Togo after attempts on Nkrumah's life. In 1961, Nkrumah warned Olympio of [...] "dangerous international consequences" [...] if the support for dissidents to his rule that were living in Togo did not cease, but Olympio largely ignored the threat.|$|E
2500|$|After {{escaping}} from Liberia, Yeaten went into hiding somewhere in West Africa, hunted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation {{for war crimes}} and crimes against humanity, and became a mercenary. He went on to work for Faure Gnassingbé, President of Togo, and Yahya Jammeh, President of the Gambia, from whom he hope to gain protection in return for training their elite forces. He {{is supposed to have}} trained the <b>Togolese</b> presidential bodyguards [...] "on guerrilla tactics and other warfare maneuvers". According to the Special Court for Sierra Leone's chief investigator, Yeaten eventually agreed to cooperate with the court, but was barred from leaving his exile in Togo by local officials. In January 2009, Liberia's Ministry of Justice officially ordered Yeaten's arrest on charges of murder, and asked Interpol to assist them in searching for him. Interpol consequently issued a red notice for Yeaten.|$|E
2500|$|A small French force invaded Togoland from north-west French Dahomey on 9 August {{and four}} days later met and skirmished with the German {{defenders}} in the districts of Sansane-Mangu and Skode-Balfilo; the French company retreated after finding German resistance greater than expected. More detachments followed and [...] German <b>Togolese</b> troops in the area deserted, many of the rest retreated and the local civilian authorities hurried to repudiate German allegiance. M. Duranthon advanced from Fada Ngurma with about [...] and volunteers, was followed by M. Arboussier with a force of [...] and police from Ouagadougou and Captain Bouchez with about [...] of the 2nd Tirailleurs Sénégalais. Arbroussier reached Sansane Mangu on 23 August and Bouchez on 26 August, having covered [...] in twenty days. A British column of [...] from Gambaga arrived at Sansane Mangu on 18 August and [...] police and volunteers occupied other places in northern Togoland, having crossed difficult country, little known to colonial occupiers.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Agbeluvhoe was {{considered}} a great defeat for the Germans by local civilians, which delayed briefly the British advance to the north until 19 August. The German force of one German and seven local companies of [...] had been expected to be most formidable, given the <b>Togolese</b> terrain. The Germans {{were not able to}} obtain information about the British in the neighbouring Gold Coast (now Ghana) and instructions by wireless from Berlin, merely insisted that the transmitting station be protected. In the first three weeks of August, the transmitter at Kamina had passed [...] from Nauen in Germany to German colonies and German shipping. Scouts under Captain A. F. Redfern arrived near the southern bank of the Chra river on 21 August. The Germans blew the bridge and detonated two mines {{in the path of the}} scouts, who were then engaged by fire from two machine-guns. The patrol was able to survey the German defences and retire unharmed, to report the German entrenchments around the village, which was [...] north of the bridge to Bryant the British commander.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{wireless}} station at Kamina was destroyed, [...] were passed between Germany, {{the navy and}} colonies following the outbreak of war. The first military operations of British soldiers during the First World War occurred in Togoland and ended soon after British operations began in continental Europe. In December 1916, the colony was split into British and French occupation zones, which cut through administrative divisions and civilian boundaries. Both powers sought a new partition and in 1919, Article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles partitioned former German colonies between the Allies. In July 1922, British Togoland and French Togoland were created from former German Togoland, as League of Nations mandates. The French acquisition consisted of about {{sixty percent of the}} colony, including the coast. The British received the smaller, less populated and less developed portion of Togoland, to the west. The part administered by the British, united with Ghana upon its independence in 1957; French Togoland gained independence in 1960, becoming the modern <b>Togolese</b> Republic. The surrender of Togoland {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the German colonial empire, which lost all of its African and Pacific possessions.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2010, the Constitutional Court {{validated}} the candidacies {{of seven}} of the eight candidates who were initially accepted by CENI. The only candidate rejected by the Constitutional Court was Kofi Yamgnane, who held joint dual nationality: the Court cited a contradiction between the date of birth given in his French documents (11 October 1945) and the date given in his <b>Togolese</b> documents (31 December 1945). According to the Court, the contradiction was [...] "of a nature to cause confusion over {{the identity of the}} person and consequently to weaken the legal and judicial security inherent in the highest office in the country". Yamgnane denounced the ruling, claiming its real motivation was to exclude [...] "the most dangerous candidate for the RPT". Initially he vowed to appeal, but that was impossible because the judgments of the Constitutional Court were final; he then said that his only recourse was to [...] "mobilize the street". He also said that, although the RPT imagined that it would [...] "remain in power eternally", [...] "we have the means to ensure that change happens in 2010 in Togo".|$|E
