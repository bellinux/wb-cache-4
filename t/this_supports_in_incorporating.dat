50|$|There {{has been}} debate {{as to whether}} gender {{transition}} {{should be included in}} psychology.  “Gender transition processes are classified as mental disorders in diagnostic manuals” Suess also explains how stigmatizes trans people as mentally unwell, and incapable. Communities such as STP (International Campaign Stop Trans Pathologization) argues that it has observed, “structural interrelations between dynamics of psychiatrization, discrimination, and transphobia and on acknowledgement of the negative effects that a psychiatric classification has on the citizenship of people”. Sonny Nordmarken states that, “The idea that trans people are mentally ill is institutionalized in psychiatric texts such as the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and thus also in medical and legal transition routes” Sonny believes that when transgender people are placed in a psychology text, they are stigmatized as mentally ill, and thus increasing microaggressions and discrimination.  A study by Schilt and Wiswall showed that in a workplace environment transitioning trans men were <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>incorporating</b> them more into society; whereas transitions trans women were demoted or fired. In the study microaggressions were noted by employers to transitioning trans women.|$|R
