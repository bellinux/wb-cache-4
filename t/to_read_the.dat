5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> tapes.

5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still {{go through the}} first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E

Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter.

5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells.

The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

Rateliff moreover provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book keeps Rateliff's commentary separate from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> original drafts as self-contained stories.|$|E
