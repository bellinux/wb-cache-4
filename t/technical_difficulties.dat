40|$|Abstract—An effort {{estimation}} {{model is}} needed for software-intensive projects that consist of hardware, embedded software {{or some combination of}} the two, as well as high level software solutions. This paper first focuses on functional decomposition techniques to measure functional complexity of a computer system and investigates its impact on system development effort. Later, it examines effects of <b>technical</b> <b>difficulty</b> and design team capability factors in order to construct the best effort estimation model. With using traditional regression analysis technique, the study develops a system development effort estimation model which takes functional complexity, <b>technical</b> <b>difficulty</b> and design team capability factors as input parameters. Finally, the assumptions of the model are tested.

5|$|A port of Resident Evil 2 for the Sega Saturn was {{developed}} internally at Capcom for a time, but <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{led to its}} cancellation in October 1998. Tiger Electronics released a sprite-based 2.5D version for their Game.com handheld in late 1998. It included only Leon's story path, and removed several of the original game's core features. In February 2013, an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 was leaked onto the Internet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties,</b> so Bob Fitch {{completely}} redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure {{that many of the}} features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|Land {{clearing}} {{began on}} December 1, 2000, and {{construction on the}} footers began February 9, 2001. X-Flight was originally supposed to open in early May 2001, but due to <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties,</b> its opening was delayed. During testing, problems were discovered with several devices including the reclining mechanism on the trains and their restraints. X-Flight's media day was eventually held on May 24, 2001, and the ride officially opened two days later on May 26.|$|E

A unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and {{to demonstrate that the}} device operated without external power sources. The public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Steorn initially said that the problems had been caused by excessive heat from the lighting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{included}} {{the very high}} transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867. There were several <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> that delayed the covering, {{many of which were}} due to the geology of Brussels, though they were not as bad as some engineers had forecast. The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed sluice gates on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous <b>technical</b> <b>difficulties</b> with this.

A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E

A single TDR-1 was tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the XBQ-4, however no production contract resulted from this testing.|$|E
