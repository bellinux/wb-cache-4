40|$|The {{scientific}} literature of nanoparticle drug delivery technologies (NDDT) between 2005 and 2014 was reviewed. The visualized co-citation network of its knowledge domain was characterized {{in terms of}} <b>thematic</b> <b>concentrations</b> of co-cited references and emerging trends of surging keywords and citations to references through a scientometric review. The combined dataset of 25, 171 bibliographic records were constructed through topic search and citation expansion to ensure adequate coverage of the field. While research in gold nanoparticle and magnetic nanoparticle remains the two most prominent knowledge domains in the NDDT field, research related to clinical and therapeutic applications has experienced a considerable growth. In particular, clinical and therapeutic developments in NDDT have demonstrated profound connections with the mesoporous silica nanoparticle research and microcrystal research. A rapid adaptation of mesoporous silica-based nanomaterials and rare earth fluoride nano-/microcrystal in NDDT is evident. Innovative strategies have been employed to exploit the multicomponent, chemical synthesis, surface modification, and controlled release imparting functionalized targeting capabilities. This study not only facilitated the connection of authors and research themes in the NDDT community, but also demonstrated how research interests and trends evolve over time, which greatly contributes {{to our understanding of}} the NDDT knowledge domains...|$|R

The natural development of populations and the migration from the Peruvian Andean zones towards the coast has reflected a growing exposure {{to be affected by}} the effects of an earthquake. Unfortunately, to assess the vulnerability of buildings there is not sufficient information, as for example the urban cadastre. This study proposes the use of high-resolution satellite images to infer the social class and to infer the type of construction and type of building. This identification of social class may indicate the seismic vulnerability level.

40|$|This paper applies recent {{developments}} in quantitative linguistics to a key theoretical question from sexology, namely: Is fetishism fundamentally a stereotypical or a creative phenomenon? If it is stereotypical and repetitive, then it can be hypothesized that narratives of fetish fantasies will demonstrate a low degree of vocabulary richness and {{a high degree of}} <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration.</b> To test these hypotheses, the present study compares two sets of online fetish fantasy stories (n = 11) with a control sample of short stories by an established literary author, D. H. Lawrence (n = 10), using the measures of vocabulary richness and <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> proposed by Popescu & Altmann (2006) and Popescu, Best & Altmann (2007). The results show that one set of fetish fantasies has a lower degree of vocabulary richness than the control sample, but the other set does not. No significant difference is detected between the three samples with regard to <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration.</b> Overall, the fetish fantasies seem to differ from the control texts only in so far as at least one fetish-related word appears amongst the thematic words for each story. It seems likely that any other quantitative stylistic variations in fetish fantasies are not connected with the phenomenon of fetishism itself. However, further work could usefully investigate the question with regard to text-linguistic features...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between ideology and language is analyzed by using quantitative linguistic methods {{to measure the}} <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> of texts. The assumption is that totalitarianism and democracy represent radically different types of ideology and that this difference will be reflected in different levels of <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> in texts of the same genre. The analysis focuses on the New Year speeches given by Czechoslovak and Czech presidents; these texts were chosen because they represent a relatively clearly delineated genre with a long tradition {{and because they are}} one of the most important outlets for the public expression of political opinions by the head of state. The results of statistical tests show that there exist significant differences between the thematic concentrations in the speeches of presidents from the totalitarian period and the period of democracy. The analysis also revealed that the largest differences in thematic concentrations were between the speeche...|$|E

The European Territorial Objective, one of three overall objectives of EU Cohesion Policy, and the programmes initiated to reach this objective have had an important impact on cooperation and networking across borders in the Nordic countries. In the new EU programming period 2014 - 2020, there will be a greater demand for <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> within the cross-border and transnational programmes. The European Commission calls for a closer coordination between the five different EU funds. Each of the CSF Funds shall support a limited number of thematic objectives in order to contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Nordregio has been commissioned by the Nordic Committee of Senior Officials for Regional Policy (EK-R), to develop a method which could facilitate the selection of themes and ensure territorial added value in the coming programming areas involving the Nordic countries. The process of concentrating resources, while at the same time coordinating actions with a number of strategies and other funding programmes, makes the added value of the impact of cross-border and transnational cooperation programmes even more vital than ever. Thus through this assignment guidelines will be set up that programme areas can use to concentrate their resources and priorities within the ETC Objective...|$|E
40|$|The present {{book can}} be {{considered}} a continuation of two streams in textology initiated by different groups of scholars. The first group consisting of Italian scientists analyzed the 57 end-of-year speeches of 9 Italian presidents since 1949 to 2005 from very different points of view. The investigation resulted in the book edited by M. A. Cortelazzo and A. Tuzzi (2007) containing statistical vistas and political, social, linguistic and cultural matter. The second group, lead by I. -I. Popescu consisting of linguists and mathematicians, focused on general aspects associated with texts, namely text characterization, fixed points, vocabulary richness, <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration,</b> compactness, study of autosemantics, the impact of the position in sentence; this group also focused on the possibility of drawing conclusions from text to the morphology of language, etc. This investigation resulted in two books authored by I. -I. Popescu et al. (2009) and I. -I. Popescu, J. Mačutek and G. Altmann (2009). The present book is a further development of methods and fully concentrated on the end-of-year addresses of Italian presidents. Moreover, the updated version of the corpus includes 60 end-of-year speeches of 10 presidents since 1949 to 2008. The aim was to look at the highest floor of the linguistically perceived reality, namely the sets of word associations, compare these worlds and pursue a possible development in this thematically homogeneous corpus. The book includes chapters concerning the golden section, Zipf´s law, parts-of-speech analysis and some issues concerning vocabulary richness,continuing the examinations resulting from earlier common publications...|$|E
40|$|It is an {{everyday}} experience {{to realize that}} things do not turn out the as expected. But what if you realize that everything you have so far experienced as reality is illusion? This article is about {{former members of the}} Jehovah’s Witnesses who have had doubts about what they previously believed to be the Truth. The article also treats the exit process, from being a Jehovah’s Witness to becoming an ex-Jehovah’s Witness. The data consists of twenty qualitative interviews with ten Jehovah’s Witnesses and twenty qualitative interviews with ten former Jehovah’s Witnesses. The data also include a diary written during four years preceding an exit from the organization. The analysis was made through <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration.</b> Ontologically the analysis and the article are based on a constructionist view though it is mainly empirical with no further theoretical assessment. However, to be able to understand the results a contextual frame is sketched with two factors affecting members who make an exit. First there are tying factors that bind the person closer to the organization; these are closeness and friendship and confirmation. A secluding factor is something that secludes the member from the outside society; these factors are the work situation and »closed doors«. With high values on these factors the exit process will be more arduous. The results are presented through a process model in which different phases or steps in the exit process are described. The following steps in the process are: (1) different levels of doubts; (2) trying out doubts; (3) turning points; (4) different decisions; (5) different steps in execution; (6) floating; (7) relative neutrality. The process is defined as an altogether ambivalent and emotionally tough experience, but other parts of life may be affected as well, such as employment, social life, family life and career...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{debate in}} the context of the future {{evolution}} of the European Research Area is concerned with the optimal spatial and thematic allocation of resources for research. This stems from a concern that EU research funds are spread too thinly across Europe without achieving the impact that is expected of them. 'Smart specialisation’ or the spatial and <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> of R&D resources on the basis of existing patterns of technological specialisation, is put forward as one possible policy direction. Agglomeration economies have been shown to be important for research: scientists and technologists tend to be more productive when located in proximity to populous communities of knowledge workers and knowledge-intensive business services. Network effects have also been shown to have a positive influence on regional knowledge production processes. A policy of sustaining or even increasing the degree of connectedness in EU research, or 'networked specialisation' is therefore put forward as a possible alternative. The present policy note draws from original empirical work attempting to shed some light on the joint importance of regional innovation capacity (proxied by a novel index of regional agglomeration of knowledge intensive employment) and scientific networking (proxied by an index of interregional collaboration in FP 5) on R&D productivity and draw comparisons. We find that regional innovation capacity and scientific networking are neither complements nor substitutes but have different functions according to the type of research involved. Our findings indicate that there are distinct paths to obtaining ‘critical mass’ for scientific and technological research. The regional agglomeration of innovation capacity is important for the productivity of technological research whereas this is not the case for scientific research; likewise, scientific research is more productive in regions that are well connected in interregional knowledge production networks, but the same networking has no discernible effect on technological research. These findings suggest that differentiated responses will be needed, with increased networking for scientific research and a strengthening of regional innovation capacity for technological research. In that respect, the adoption of fine-tuned instruments for industry (IPs, STREPs) and science (NoEs) from FP 6 onwards appear to be a step in the right direction. Complementary interventions will be needed to support the innovation capacity of lagging regions...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation entails social, political, technological, {{environmental}} and cultural cross-border exchange and links, which connect individuals, communities and governments, {{all over the}} world. Major environmental problems, such as air pollution, deforestation, {{the hole in the}} ozone layer and global warming, have to be solved, because they affect everyone living on earth. Saving ecosystems through the conservation of non-renewable energy sources and the preservation of natural habitats is of primary importance, as well. According to the EU budget for 2014 - 2020 the cohesion policy invests 325 billion euros in member states {{in order to be able}} to accomplish the aims related to growth and the creation of workplaces and deal with the challenges of climate change, energy dependency and social exclusion. The smart, sustainable and inclusive growth should be highlighted from the strategic objectives of cohesion policy and the 11 thematic objectives, the accomplishment of which is compulsory for all the member states. The template requirement of the implementation of EU goals makes it difficult to enforce national aims and their representation in development plans. Another problem is that among the goals there are no specifically regional ones. The most important regulatory changes in the new budget cycle refer to the reduction of utilizable funds, strengthening resource and <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration,</b> stricter measurement of results, and making it more difficult to access funds. The system of aims of the Széchenyi 2020 development plan is adjusted to the regulations following the value aims of Europe 2020 strategy and formulates sustainable, high added value production, expansion of employment and national aims promoting economic growth. The 8 cohesion programs including the national contribution envisage the use of 25297 billion euros, the 60 percent of which serves the goals of economic development. Priority is given to regional and municipal development, {{environmental and}} energy efficiency, traffic and human resource development. In the paper we deal with the changes and strategy of cohesion policy and the Széchenyi 2020 development plan.

40|$|Beginning with 1 January 2007 a new {{programming}} {{period of the}} European Structural Funds {{is going to start}} (2007 - 2013). The negotiations about the contents and the re-gional structure of the funds are still in progress, but the European Commission has al-ready published her thoughts in the Third Cohesion Report and in some draft regulations (KOM 2004 / 492; KOM 2004 / 493; KOM 2004 / 494; KOM 2004 / 495). Main elements of the Commission’s proposal are the concentration of funding for the least developed regions and Member States, the <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> on the strategies of Lisbon and Gothenburg as well as institutional capacity building (KOM 2004 : XXXVI). The Commission is willing to introduce a new priority (‘Regional Competitiveness and Employment’) as a successor of Objective 2 to strengthen the regional competitiveness and the employment. The new priority is following the Lisbon Strategy and therefore mainly promoting innovation and the knowledge society (ERDMENGER; ZIEGLER 2004 : 327). Besides the textual change of the funding the Commission’s proposal is making clear, that the evaluation of structural funding is – as {{it has been in the}} past programming pe-riods – a necessary condition to achieve the quality standards of funding. This means that ex-ante-, mid-term- as well as ex-post-Evaluations remain obligatory (KOM 2004 : XXXVII). At present a complete and consistent evaluation of the funding-effects can not necessar-ily take place, because of a lack of statistical information on the regional level as well as difficulties in comparing the regions’ funding achievements (z. B. TOEPEL 2000 : 400; BEYWL; TAUT 2000 : 359). These problems are especially true for the evaluation of innova-tion related actions, because the general problems are accumulated with problems of the measurability of innovation (PERRIN 2000 : 5 ff; DIEZ 2001 : 912 ff; AUTIO 1998 : 132). If the plans of the commission happen to turn into law on 1 January 2007, the importance of Innovation related actions will increase as well as the political requirement to measure and value their effects. The goal of this paper is to contribute to an alternative concept to evaluate innovation related actions under the EU Structural Funds. Main differences between the present evaluation concept and the paper’s proposal point to problems, which were identified by two case studies of existing evaluations of innovation related actions. ...|$|E
40|$|Territorial {{approaches}} are a more prominent part of Cohesion {{policy in the}} 2014 - 20 period. Under the evolving urban dimension in European Structural and Investment Funds, the new regulations stipulate a ring-fenced budget of five percent of expenditure for Integrated Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD). New tools to implement territorial approaches have been introduced, including Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and Community-led Local Development (CLLD). These tools can be applied in urban areas but also in other territories. The manner in which territorial {{approaches are}} programmed, funded, thematically focussed and implemented differs greatly across IQ-Net countries/regions: •ISUD. In countries/regions where ISUD is implemented through a Priority axis, spending allocations range from close to five percent to almost 20 percent. Some programmes are solely focusing on large metropolitan centres, while others are also concentrating on smaller regional centres. Thematically, ISUD tends to focus on environmental protection and social inclusion. The governance arrangements require a significant level of delegation to the local level, but not all countries use Intermediate Bodies to achieve this. •ITIs. These are used to implement ISUD but can also target other forms of territorial development. In some countries/regions, ITIs {{are expected to be}} a major delivery instrument. Geographically, ITIs tend to focus on urban areas but can also target sub-regional areas, interregional areas or regions with specific territorial features. ITIs are programmed to cover innovation and competitiveness, low carbon economy and renewables and social cohesion themes. Selecting ITIs either happens through pre-selection (based on indicators or a political process) or competitive selection. Local bodies will be significantly involved in the implementation of the strategies, taking on responsibilities concerning the development of strategies, animation and project generation, selection or pre-selection of project activities. •CLLD. Funding allocations for CLLD will vary significantly across Member States and regions. Some use CLLD in a large range of geographical areas, including urban and peri-urban areas. Most Member States will implement CLLD across multiple OPs, contributing to a range of thematic goals. Most CLLD management approaches retain programme Managing Authorities (MAs) in a management role. CLLD can also be used on a cross-border basis. The approach for 2014 - 20 is an extension of existing methods and fits within emerging domestic policy frameworks. Many authorities at Member State level recognise the value of, and show enthusiasm for, integrated territorial approaches and some consider them innovative and inspiring. Potential benefits include increased efficiency and more local power/influence in decision-making. However, MAs have the difficult task of having to establish structures and implementation mechanisms that satisfy local actors’ expectations but also adhere to regulatory requirements. Other challenges include local capacity issues in relation to implementing territorial approaches and questions concerning how <b>thematic</b> <b>concentration</b> and results-orientation align with ring-fenced territorial approaches. Finally, due to the variety of ways in which territorial approaches can be implemented, the provision of guidance has been challenging. A workgroup, Territorial Cohesion and Urban Matters (TCUM), has been established to support implementation of the territorial and urban aspects of the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds. In relation to ITIs, the drafting of scenarios should provide clarification and be a source of inspiration...|$|E
