5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of <b>the</b> <b>pendulum,</b> {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock.

The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

50|$|A double {{inverted}} <b>pendulum</b> is <b>the</b> {{combination of}} <b>the</b> inverted <b>pendulum</b> and <b>the</b> double <b>pendulum.</b> <b>The</b> double inverted <b>pendulum</b> is unstable, {{meaning that it}} will fall down unless it is controlled in some way.

25|$|If these {{variations}} in the escapement's force cause changes in <b>the</b> <b>pendulum's</b> width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in <b>the</b> <b>pendulum's</b> cycle, so force variations {{have no effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>pendulum's</b> amplitude.

5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending <b>the</b> <b>pendulum,</b> an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting <b>the</b> <b>pendulum.</b> Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district.

Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). <b>The</b> <b>pendulum</b> thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v.

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a sundial.

The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.|$|E

5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house <b>the</b> <b>pendulum</b> and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
50|$|Since it is <b>the</b> slave <b>pendulum</b> that {{releases}} <b>the</b> gravity lever, this synchronization {{is vital}} to the functioning of the clock.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} swing-up control scheme for a cart-type single {{pendulum}} having a serial second pendulum as a parasitic part. The proposed control scheme swings up <b>the</b> first <b>pendulum</b> with controlling <b>the</b> motion of a cart and being robust to the parasitic part. In the swing-up, <b>the</b> second <b>pendulum</b> is swinging {{at the top}} of <b>the</b> first <b>pendulum</b> and <b>the</b> motion of <b>the</b> second <b>pendulum</b> works as strong disturbance to the control of <b>the</b> first <b>pendulum.</b> Hence <b>the</b> control scheme is required to be strongly robust to the disturbance, and this paper uses sliding mode control law as the controller, which is strongly robust to disturbance. After the swing-up, the controller also stabilizes both angles of <b>the</b> <b>pendulums</b> and cart position. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
