5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Kabuto's defeat and needing answers, Sasuke exposes Orochimaru's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated. Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student, Anko Mitarashi, Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto's flesh. Despite expressing {{no interest in the}} ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke's body, Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja, taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being into one of the White Zetsu clones placed on Sasuke. In his new body, Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> the Reanimation Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants. Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama, out of curiosity to see his former apprentice's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories, Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju. After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended, among those caught under Madara's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed, Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Team Taka (minus Sasuke who returns to Konoha) supporting him as lab assistants, though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps tabs on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{his first}} murder conviction, Tobin served ten {{years in prison for}} a double rape {{committed}} in 1993, following which he was released in 2004. In 2007, he was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of 21 years for the rape and murder of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in 2006. Skeletal remains of a further two young women who went missing in 1991 were subsequently found at his former home in Margate, Kent. Tobin was convicted of the murder of Vicky Hamilton in December 2008, resulting in his minimum sentence being increased to 30 years, and of the murder of Dinah McNicol in December 2009, resulting in a whole life order. Tobin has been labelled a psychopath by a senior psychologist, and by professor of criminology David Wilson, who also wrote a book on the killer connecting him with the Bible John murders of the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Asclepius, {{the son of}} Apollo and Koronis, {{learned the}} secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent {{bringing}} another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius' death {{at the hands of}} Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The Bibliotheca claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from {{the left side of the}} Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy Ion that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents.|$|E

25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an endless loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum up the courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E
