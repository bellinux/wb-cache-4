25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E

It advances the idea that leadership identities are imaginary constructions that invariable fail, reiterating a lack of being. Empirical material consisting of interviews with 15 leaders is used to explore the productive role this lack plays. The study suggests that leadership identities are always already subverted by unconscious desire and therefore less powerful <b>than</b> <b>we</b> might <b>think</b> with regard to imposing structures on others, but also much more powerful <b>than</b> <b>we</b> might <b>think</b> as liberating struggles with leaders’ imaginary selves.

30|$|There {{are always}} more unknowns <b>than</b> what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> already know in any {{scientific}} fields, {{the same is}} especially true for the self-secondaries issue. While the broad indication for the importance of self-secondaries on crater statistics is obvious, fully unlocking the effects needs more systematic work. For example, what is the occurrence of self-secondaries on various ejecta facies? This question is related to the possible formation time of self-secondaries populations. Are there SFD of newly formed self-secondaries idential for craters with different sizes and/or ages? This problem would determine whether or not the effect of self-secondaries on crater statistics could be removed by applying a representative crater SFD. Several of such critical issues are discussed below.|$|R
