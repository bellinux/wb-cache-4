40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{willingness}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for health care services in contingent valuation studies should be assessed ex ante from an insurance perspective. It may however be easier to assess the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> among a group of patients in need of a specific treatment. This willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> measure can be used to estimate the expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> This paper investigates the relationship between ex ante and expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> It is shown that expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> is a lower bound for ex ante willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a treatment that restores the individual to full health for an individual that is risk averse with respect to income. For a treatment that does not restore an individual to full health the expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> is not necessarily a lower bound for the ex ante willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> if the marginal utility of income increases with better health. willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> health care contingent valuation cost-benefit analysis...|$|R

The rational rate was influenced not only these matters but also unit cost. This study aimed to determine the ability and willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> from community living in the puskesmas Taman, Tarik and Sekardanganworking areas. Its design was descriptive. The population {{of the study were}} families living in research locations. Proportional stratified random sampling technique was used. The sample size were 420 families. Variables under study were family characteristics, ability <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Data were selected by interview to respondent with structural questionare.

Results showed that the median of the ability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> those areas were similar for Puskesmas Taman was Rp. 23. 127, puskesmas Tarik was Rp. 20. 391, and puskesmas Sekardangan was Rp. 21. 355, respectively the ability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for out patient cares were in general more than Rp. 20. 000,-  just few below Rp. 5000,-, but for in patient cares was more than 30 % had the ability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> less than the standart rate. The willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for out patient care was in general Rp. 5000,- even those more than 15 % were will <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more than Rp. 5000,-. For in patient care, in general they were willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Rp. 20. 000,- but especially in puskesmas Taman, 45. 4 % respondents were willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> between Rp. 30. 000 - 60. 000,-. It concluded the ability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> of respondents for out patient cares was more than the standart rate, and also the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> But for in patient cares, many respondents (30 %) had the ability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Jess of the standart rate, and willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> too.

5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, Ha!

Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little excitement in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

40|$|Willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{for quality}} change {{may depend on}} {{heterogeneous}} perceived quality levels. In these instances, contingent valuation studies should include measures of quality perceptions as covariates in the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> model {{in order to avoid}} omitted variable bias. Variation in quality perceptions across respondents leads to a potential endogeneity of quality perceptions. We address the potential for endogeneity bias using an instrumental variable approach in which a measure of quality perceptions is included as a determinant of willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and is simultaneously determined by various exogenous factors. The willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> model is estimated jointly with quality perceptions allowing for correlation of the error terms. Using data on willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for water quality improvements in the Neuse River in North Carolina we reject exogeneity of perceived quality.

On average, 54 % of the households are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality.

Those with a higher income were willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income.
