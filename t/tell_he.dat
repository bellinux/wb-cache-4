25|$|Just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, {{they are}} also sensitive; his main {{weakness}} is his vulnerability to powerful sounds or odors that can temporarily weaken his radar sense. This weakness {{is often used to}} immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a hallucinogenic drug designed so that Daredevil could not <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} sought to {{distinguish}} observed facts from myths and popular errors and {{was known for his}} accurate depiction of many animals in Historiae animalium, he also included many fictional animals such as the Unicorn and the Basilisk, which he had only heard about from medieval bestiaries. But when Gessner doubted the accuracy of the opinions he relayed in his own writings, or the validity of the illustrations he included, he clearly said so. Besides any plant or animal's potential advantage to people, Gessner was interested in learning about them because of the moral lessons they could teach and the divine truths they might <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> went into as much detail about some unreal animals as he did about real ones. Later in 1556 he also combined real and fictional creatures in his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.|$|E
25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E

25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one way to <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E

You can <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> has this love of musical theater {{and he has the}} vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." [...] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in [...] "Cape Feare". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for [...] "Cape Feare" [...] earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore– Series in 1994.|$|E

The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode.

500|$|In 1994, {{director}} James Cameron {{wrote an}} 80-page treatment for Avatar, drawing inspiration from [...] "every single science fiction book" [...] {{he had read}} in his childhood {{as well as from}} adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.

The project would cost $100million and involve at least six actors in leading roles [...] "who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world". Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release. However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years.

500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E

2500|$|Simona Popescu, the poet-essayist, {{presumes that}} Urmuz's inner {{motivation}} was his [...] "psycho-mania", which holds {{no respect for}} either convention or posterity, but only for committing one's own [...] "abyssal obsessions" [...] to paper: [...] "death, the Eros, creation, and destruction." [...] Adrian Lăcătuș also makes note of Urmuz's ambiguous allusions to autoeroticism, incest, bisexuality or paraphilia. Additionally, various commentators suggest that Urmuz's creative spark hides an unresolved conflict with his father. According to Cernat, Urmuz was in conflict with [...] "paternal authority" [...] and more attached to his mother, an [...] "Oedipus complex" [...] also found in some other literary figures of the pre-modernist generation. Others too see in Ciriviș's pranks a planned revenge against parental and social pressures.
