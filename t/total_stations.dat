5|$|It was {{reported}} that only 7,000 daily riders entered the station between September 13–22, 2015, drastically below the MTA's projected ridership of 32,000 passengers upon the station's opening. This was attributed to incompleteness of developments in the area, {{as well as an}} unopened entrance to the High Line park, which is nearby. In late October 2015, AM New York found that the average daily ridership was even lower, at only 5,900 passengers per day, except for during the 2015 New York Comic Con on October 8–11, when average daily ridership reached 18,300 daily riders. The station's official ridership between September 13 and December 31, 2015, was 692,165, making it the 392nd busiest station in the city out of 422 <b>total</b> <b>stations.</b> Ridership at the station increased in 2016 with 2,691,851 riders, making it the 189th busiest station in the city out of 422 <b>total</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E

25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a {{surveyor}} measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), <b>total</b> <b>stations,</b> GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|E
50|$|A <b>total</b> <b>station</b> or TST (<b>total</b> <b>station</b> theodolite) is an electronic/optical {{instrument}} used for surveying and building construction. The <b>total</b> <b>station</b> is an electronic theodolite (transit) integrated {{with an electronic}} distance measurement (EDM) to read slope distances from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform advanced coordinate based calculations.|$|R
50|$|The {{coordinates}} of {{an unknown}} point relative to a known coordinate can be determined using the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> {{as long as a}} direct line of sight can be established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> to points under survey, and the coordinates (X, Y, and Z or easting, northing and elevation) of surveyed points relative to the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> position are calculated using trigonometry and triangulation.To determine an absolute location a <b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> requires line of sight observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or more points with known location, called Resection (Free Stationing).|$|R
5000|$|In surveying, free {{stationing}} (also {{known as}} resection) {{is a method}} of determining a location of one unknown point in relation to known points. There is a zero point of reference called a <b>Total</b> <b>station.</b> The instrument can be freely positioned so that all survey points are at a suitable sight from the instrument. Setting up the <b>Total</b> <b>station</b> on a known point, often {{it is not possible}} to see all survey points. With the <b>Total</b> <b>Station,</b> bearings and distances are measured to at least two known points of a control network.

40|$|In land development, {{the need}} for up to date planimetric plans is emphasised. Numerous {{techniques}} {{can be used to}} produce these plans such as traditional photogrammetry, satellite photogrammetry and terrestrial surveying using <b>total</b> <b>station</b> or Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques. However, {{for the purpose of this}} paper, GPS and <b>total</b> <b>station</b> are used together with photogrammetric techniques. GPS was used to establish ground control points for aerial triangulation in photogrammetry. Some selected portions within the campus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) are chosen to carry out this integration mapping [1]. Field surveying technique using <b>total</b> <b>station</b> is always adopted as a traditional method for planimetric plan production and mapping of urban and rural areas. Both the conventional surveying i. e., <b>Total</b> <b>station</b> and photogrammetry could be used for surveying purposes but the accuracy and techniques of each method differs from one another, hence in this project, both techniques are looked at in order to compare and draw some inferences. The main objectives will be to produce planimetric plan of the study area using conventional surveying technique (i. e., <b>total</b> <b>station)</b> and photogrammetric method to perform analysis of the two surveying methods...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this present}} work was to compare planialtimetric charts {{obtained}} from different risings using two different theodolite types, a <b>total</b> <b>station,</b> and a precision level, used as control. Using a <b>total</b> <b>station,</b> an area was marked with clear variations of relief, following a grid, with a distance of 20 meters among stakes. After that, the stakes were read by the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> and two theodolites of different precisions. The geometric leveling was done by a precision level. The data were input in the DataGeosis software and the numerical modelling of the land was made with mesh of maximum rigidity, generating planialtimetric representation for each rising. It was verified, through comparison of the four representations that little variations occur {{in relation to the}} control. The closest representation of the control was the planialtimetry based on the data from the <b>total</b> <b>station,</b> in which the representations obtained from the theodolites were identical among themselves. It was concluded that in the process of obtaining detailed planialtimetry of small areas, submitted to the grid, it was not necessary to use composed geometric leveling, reducing work to the exclusive use of a <b>total</b> <b>station</b> or conventional theodolite...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{overburden}} and coal excavations in open-pit mine is generally determined by conventional survey such as <b>total</b> <b>station.</b> This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} accuracy of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) used to measure overburden and coal excavations, and to compare TLS survey data sets with the data of the <b>total</b> <b>station.</b> Results revealed that, the reference points measured with the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> showed 0. 2 mm precision for both horizontal and vertical coordinates. When using TLS on the same points, the standard deviations of 4. 93 cm and 0. 53 cm for horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively, were achieved. For volume measurements covering the mining areas of 79, 844 m 2, TLS yielded the mean difference of about 1 % and the surface error margin of 6 cm at the 95 % confidence level {{when compared to the}} volume obtained by <b>total</b> <b>station...</b>|$|R

40|$|Vehicle crush {{measurements}} {{have typically}} been done using either offset methods or punctual survey {{methods such as}} with a <b>total</b> <b>station</b> or using photogrammetry. While offset grid methods are functional in determining 2 -D displacement along the x and y-axis, vertical movement along the z-axis is much harder to achieve. Using a <b>total</b> <b>station</b> to complete crush measurements around a vehicle can yield accurate measurements along all 3 -axis but will require multiple station set-ups to traverse around a vehicle. Depending on the <b>total</b> <b>station</b> being used a second person may also be required to move a prism to each measurement location around the vehicle. In both the offset and <b>total</b> <b>station</b> methods, all points of interest must be measured {{at the time of}} the vehicle inspection. Using photogrammetry to determine 3 -D deformation of a vehicle can result in the accuracy of a <b>total</b> <b>station</b> with only one operator and allows the versatility of measuring any number of points at any time using the available photographs. A system has been created that utilizes photogrammetric technology but greatly increases productivity by automating the camera orientation and point marking process through the use of coded and non-coded targets. This system, utilizing some of the features available in Eos System’s PhotoModeler software, will decrease the time required to map a damaged or exemplar vehicle, increase the total number of points mapped in that time and automate the process of matching the two vehicles for crush determination. For approximately 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of the cost of a low-end <b>total</b> <b>station,</b> the collision reconstructionist can have a system that will determine a greater number of 3 -D measurements in less time than required for a <b>total</b> <b>station.</b> The same principles and equipment can also be used to complete many of the scene measurement requirements of a collision reconstructionist...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There is some rate of {{distortion}} in {{the projected}} plane coordinates obtained by GPS. The coordinates obtained using terrestrial {{devices such as}} <b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> depends on the direct angular observations and distances measurements {{on the surface of}} the earth assumed as plane surface. Using different observation systems (terrestrial survey and GPS survey) yields discrepancies in the obtained results for the same location due to the variation of the observation sources and the technology used by each system. The discrepancy that exists in the measured results must be removed to obtain conformity of them by deriving scale factor which is the main objective of this study. This paper covers the procedure of integration between the Electronic <b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> and the Global Positioning System (GPS) and their use in surveying engineering projects. In this paper the author used <b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> and the Global Positioning System (GPS) commonly using observations of common points with the two systems (<b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> and the GPS receivers) to get the horizontal position difference and the scale factor between the <b>Total</b> <b>Station</b> and the GPS coordinates.
