40|$|Land surface skin {{temperature}} <b>T</b> <b>s</b> plays a {{key role}} in mete- orological and climatological processes but the availability and the accuracy of <b>T</b> <b>s</b> measurements over land are still limited, especially under cloudy con- ditions. <b>T</b> <b>s</b> estimates from infrared satellite observations can only be derived under clear sky. Passive microwave measurements are much less affected by clouds and can provide <b>T</b> <b>s</b> regardless of the cloud conditions. A neural net- work inversion including first guess information has been previously devel- oped to retrieve <b>T</b> <b>s,</b> along with atmospheric water vapor, cloud liquid wa- ter, and surface emissivities over land from Special Sensor Microwave / Im- ager measurements [Aires et al., 2001], with a spatial resolution of 0. 25 o 0. 25 o, at least twice daily. In this study, <b>T</b> <b>s</b> estimates are evaluated through care- ful comparisons with in situ measurements in different environments over a full annual cycle. Under clear sky conditions, the quality of our microwave neural network retrieval is equivalent to the infrared International Satellite Cloud Clima- tology Project products, for most in situ stations, with errors 3 K as com- pared to in situ measurements. The performance of the microwave algorithm is similar under clear and cloudy conditions, confirming the potential of the microwaves under clouds. The <b>T</b> <b>s</b> accuracy does not depend upon the sur- face emissivity, as the variability of this parameter is accounted for in the processing. Our microwave <b>T</b> <b>s</b> have been calculated for more than 15 years (1993 -mid 2008).

40|$|The phylogenetic affinities of the melanistic {{subspecies}} Trachylepis sulcata nigra {{have never}} been investigated, and it was unclear if this subspecies represented a locally adapted population or a distinct species. Sequences from the nuclear marker RAG- 1 (1149 bp), two novel rapidly-evolving nuclear markers KIF 24 and EXPH 5 (554 bp and 941 bp respectively), and the mitochondrial gene ND 2 (1056 bp) were analysed from 84 individuals of <b>T.</b> <b>s.</b> sulcata and two individuals of <b>T.</b> <b>s.</b> nigra. Additionally, the range of <b>T.</b> <b>s.</b> nigra was estimated using museum records, and correlations between environmental variables and the occurrence of melanism were explored.
