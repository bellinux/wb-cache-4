25|$|Democrats reacted {{positively}} to John Kerry's acceptance speech. With Democrats strongly opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> John Kerry {{spent most of}} his speech appealing to independent voters and to swing voters. He promised to train 40,000 new active duty troops, to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, to cut the national deficit in half within four years, to cut middle class taxes while repealing the Bush administration's tax cuts for those making more than US$200,000 per year, to stop privatization of Social Security, and to expand stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the same}} tone as the French debate, {{much of the}} {{discussion}} revolved around {{the economy and the}} environment. The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> and Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

2500|$|John Yoo, {{legal advisor}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> has {{explicitly}} invoked Federalist No. 70 in {{his support for}} executive power over foreign policy. Referencing Hamilton, Yoo has claimed that [...] "the centralization of authority in the President is particularly crucial in matters of national defense, war, and foreign policy, where a unitary executive can evaluate threats, consider policy choices, and mobilize national resources with a speed and energy that is far superior to any other branch.” [...] Yoo has also cited Federalist No. 70 in his support of the President’s right to unilaterally conduct operations against terrorists without congressional consent. He claims that this power applies to operations against both individuals and states. At least one scholar has also argued that, because {{the president has the}} most access to national security information, only the president can know when the War on Terror is over and no longer mandates an expansive executive authority.|$|E
2500|$|On September 17, 2006, Warner {{said that}} U.S. {{military}} and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US {{in the name}} of fighting terrorism. He feared that the administration’s civilian lawyers and a president who never saw combat were putting U.S. service personnel at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at Geneva Conventions’ standards that have protected them since 1949. Following the Supreme Court ruling on Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which was adverse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration,</b> Warner (with Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain) negotiated with the White House the language of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, suspending habeas corpus provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an [...] "unlawful combatant" [...] and barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Warner's vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 Newsweek {{profiled}} Sirota as a [...] "political operative" [...] {{skilled at}} [...] "hacking out a daily barrage of anti-Bush media clips, commentary, and snappy quotes" [...] who made [...] "guerrilla {{attacks on the}} Bush administration" [...] and who was [...] "well schooled {{in the art of}} Washington warfare." [...] According to the article, Sirota's main weapons were computer emails. Sirota was described as the [...] "Internet child of the Clinton War Room generation." [...] Former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta said of Sirota: [...] "I just saw he had an eye for critique and the instinct for the jugular." [...] For example, Sirota unearthed a two-year-old comment which Colin Powell had made to the effect that [...] "Iraq posed no threat to its neighbors, and possessed no 'significant capability' in weapons of mass destruction." [...] Sirota made Powell's statements more widely known. Reporters pounced, and it became a public relations blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b> Sirota was credited with having revealed that $87 billion for Iraq could have been used to erase huge state deficits at home, a fact that was repeated by Democrats nationwide.|$|E

[...] Gibson compared the savagery in the film <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> telling British film magazine Hotdog, [...] "The fear-mongering we depict in the film reminds me of President Bush and his guys." [...] Just prior to its release, Apocalypto was criticized by activists in Guatemala, including Lucio Yaxon, who charged that the trailer depicts Maya as savages. In her review of the film, anthropologist Traci Ardren wrote that Apocalypto was biased because [...] "no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities". Apocalypto also sparked a strong condemnation from art history professor Julia Guernsey, a Mesoamerican specialist, who said, [...] "I think it's despicable. It's offensive to Maya people. It's offensive {{to those of us}} who try to teach cultural sensitivity and alternative world views that might not match our own 21st century Western ones but are nonetheless valid.".|$|E

[...] King was reinstated only one week later after promising {{to take a more}} active role. Young said of the suspension, [...] "I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention.

[...] After he was reinstated, King prepared a four-year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. [...] "I sit beside my successor, to assure him of my love and support," [...] said Rev. Lowery. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks.
