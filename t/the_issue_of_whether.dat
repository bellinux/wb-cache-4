5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E

The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government.

However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl.

5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that if <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue {{according to the new}} provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments.

To this purpose, a country-specific measure of tax erosion is derived that is used as a determinant of the degree of fiscal federalism. We find that an increase of economic integration causes a decline of the implicit tax rates on mobile capital and the process of tax erosion positively contributes to the growth of public sector decentralisation...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{government of}} ancient Macedonia {{was that of}} its monarchy, lasting until 167BC when it was abolished by the Romans. The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed {{since at least the}} time of Archaic Greece, with Homeric aristocratic roots in Mycenaean Greece. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages, Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions, each having its own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> primogeniture was the established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king. It is unclear if the male offspring of Macedonian queens or consorts were always preferred over others given the accession of Archelaus I of Macedon, son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> or not to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

40|$|The preface {{deals with}} some basic <b>issues</b> in <b>the</b> social and {{organizational}} study {{of information systems}} along three directions of analysis. The first direction draws attention on how phenomenological concepts {{make it possible to}} recast the idea and the use of formal representations in computer programming as a challenge for the information systems design. The second direction of analysis focuses on the changes in the practices of planning, designing, and deploying information systems in the case of global Information Infrastructures implemented across multiple sites within large branch-plan organizational structures. It further shows how these changes challenge core assumptions embedded in received notions of phenomenology via ethnomethodology, and discusses the biographic turn in the social study of information infrastructures. The third direction deals with <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> and how organizational re-design associated with the introduction of ICTs in work settings is still possible even though the starting point is the focus on 'unique and singular worlds' which, actually, challenges the word of 'design'. It further discusses different conceptualizations of the concept-word of 'ICT-related organizational design' and different approaches to techno-organizational re-design. Finally, it addresses <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> and how it is possible to carry out ICT- related organizational change processes consistently with organizational members’ requirements, and discusses the role of conflicts and power in this regard...|$|R
