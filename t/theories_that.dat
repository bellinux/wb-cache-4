5|$|The Eskaya {{community}} has been the object of ongoing controversy, particularly with regards to its status as an indigenous group and the classification of the Eskayan language.

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place.

Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{quantity}} and excellent {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become the paradigm of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> describe elementary particles.|$|E
