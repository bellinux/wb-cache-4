5|$|A plan {{to widen}} the Narrows Bridge was {{announced}} on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million plan would involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes, and {{was part of a}} $230 million package upgrading and extending {{the southern end of the}} Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition Transport spokesperson, attacked the plan, saying that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> instead build a railway to Rockingham.|$|E

5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable and that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> honor the contracts, as they {{formed the basis of}} public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E

5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1963, NATO Supreme Commander General Lauris Norstad visited Ottawa, {{in one of}} {{a series}} of visits to member nations prior to his retirement. At a news conference, Norstad stated that if Canada did not accept nuclear weapons, it would not be {{fulfilling}} its commitments to NATO. Newspapers across Canada criticized Diefenbaker, who was convinced the statement was part of a plot by Kennedy to bring down his government. Although the Liberals had been previously indecisive on the question of nuclear weapons, on January 12, Pearson made a speech stating that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> live up to the commitments it had made.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience {{and should not be}} administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> not {{be held accountable for}} pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|Six {{men were}} {{candidates}} for the Greenback nomination. James B. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, Benjamin F.

Weaver triumphed quickly, winning {{a majority of the}} 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the initial vote. More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over women's suffrage, Chinese immigration, {{and the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> regulate working conditions.|$|E

5|$|Trained {{research}} teams {{were already on}} the ground on Java responding to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E
5|$|By October, Moreno's {{measures}} {{started to}} generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders {{did not like}} the protectionist policy, and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment. On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, and they were all jailed. This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica. Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo, the enemy of the Junta. Saavedra replied that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions. The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, {{a far more}} {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto.

In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E
