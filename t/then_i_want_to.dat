6000|$|... 'So I could!' said Phyllis, as if a {{new light}} had broken in upon her.

6000|$|... "Well; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get a noo clock. That one in {{the corner}} is a perfit fright. A noo table, too, for the leg o' that one has bin mended so often that it won't never stand another splice. Then a noo tea-pot an' a fender and fire-irons would be a comfort. But my great wish {{is to get a}} big {{mahogany}} four-post bed with curtains. Stephen says he never did sleep in a four-poster, and often wondered what it would be like--no more did I, so I would like to take him by surprise, you see. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> git--" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go {{away and}} hide behind a thicket and kick myself, but what I {{actually}} did was to give Pups part of my meat.
