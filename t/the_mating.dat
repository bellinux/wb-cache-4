5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. <b>The</b> <b>mating</b> system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of}} their physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the docking module over to Atlantiss docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support <b>the</b> <b>mating.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock breeds in {{the early}} months of the year and, on average, lays its eggs around March. During the height of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, males engage in {{competitive}} displays in lek, which is a complex courting behaviour that is done to attract females. Males and females live separately except when the females choose a mate. <b>The</b> <b>mating</b> success varies based on multiple factors, ranging from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. The females choose a male by flying down to the ground and pecking the male on his rump. The male then turns around and <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> takes place almost immediately. There is speculation that the male-to-male competition {{is an important factor in}} lek formation and breeding. The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles and black-and-white hawk-eagles.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mate</b> tribe speak [...] " [...] Mate Pao", {{a slight}} {{deviation}} of Thadou, {{popularly known as}} [...] "Zouyang dialect" [...] and also other dialects of the Tibeto-Burman languages. <b>The</b> <b>Mate</b> dialect was returned in the Census of India (1961) and Dr. M.S.Thirumalai, then Linguistic Research Officer of Central Institute of Indian Languages did a study on <b>the</b> <b>Mate</b> dialect in 1969. <b>The</b> <b>Mate</b> Literature Society (MLS), Manipurhad, published a primer in Mate in 1960 and 2001.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mating</b> season lasts from May through July, {{during the}} cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas are {{generally}} solitary, but not strictly so; {{as a rule}} they interact very little except in male rivalry during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season. However, black mambas are well known to share retreats occasionally, either with other mambas, or sometimes with other species of snakes.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents {{attempt to}} subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and raising their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
40|$|Song re: a young Irishman, McCarthy, who {{stowed away}} on "The City of the Baltimore", bound for New York. <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> insults McCarthy as "an Irishman". McCarthy offers to fight any man on board. He defeats <b>the</b> <b>mate,</b> second mate and bosun (all of whom use tools against McCarthy - an iron blade and a hand spike). The captain rewards McCarthy by making him <b>the</b> <b>mate...</b>|$|R
60|$|With a {{confident}} smile Zingall got up quietly from the locker, and fixed his terrible gaze on <b>the</b> <b>mate.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> fell back {{and gazed at}} him open-mouthed.|$|R
60|$|A {{meal was}} being served on deck {{in the shade}} of the spanker, and Jerry, sitting between the two men {{received}} his share. Already he had made the generalization that of the two, the captain was the superior god, giving many orders that <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> obeyed. <b>The</b> <b>mate,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, gave orders to the blacks, but never did he give orders to the captain. Furthermore, Jerry was developing a liking for the captain, so he snuggled close to him. When he put his nose into the captain's plate, he was gently reprimanded. But once, when he merely sniffed at <b>the</b> <b>mate's</b> steaming tea-cup, her received a snub on the nose from <b>the</b> <b>mate's</b> grimy forefinger. Also, <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> did not offer him food.|$|R
5|$|Finally, it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. <b>The</b> <b>mating</b> season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. <b>The</b> <b>mating</b> season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|On flight day 3, the STS-74 {{crew members}} {{successfully}} mated the 15-foot Russian built docking module with the shuttle's Orbiter Docking System. No problems were reported during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> operation.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced {{halfway through}} the first season, this round {{reversed}} the earlier roles, with the original bachelor/bachelorette being interviewed by their prospected <b>mate.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> rang <b>the</b> bell, the date was on, and the show paid for all the expenses. However, if <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> hit <b>the</b> [...] "Bzzer", the date was off, and <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> was given a prize package for their trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait--wait a minute," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>mate,</b> pouring oil. And he went {{round to}} look. But {{suddenly}} the bus started, with a vicious lurch. <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> came flying and hung {{on to the}} footboard. He had really almost been left. The driver glanced round sardonically {{to see if he}} were there. The bus flew on. <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> shook his head in deprecation.|$|R
60|$|The skipper read {{it through}} {{in a state}} of stupefaction, then he handed it to <b>the</b> <b>mate,</b> who had {{followed}} him on deck. <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> read it and handed it back.|$|R
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew members}} also {{checked out the}} Advanced Space Vision System, a precise {{alignment}} system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> operation, consisted {{of a series of}} large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the docking system.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mating</b> was {{confirmed}} at 1:17am CST, with Atlantis over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew's {{appreciation for the}} training that prepared them for the docking module installation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t believe there’s {{such a thing}} {{aboard the}} ship," [...] said Ted, who had obeyed <b>the</b> <b>mate’s</b> {{thoughtful}} injunction. [...] "NOR thread. I was only saying so to <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the skipper}} drew the {{blankets}} from <b>the</b> <b>mate’s</b> sleepy clutches, and, rolling him backwards and forwards in the bunk, patiently {{explained to him}} that he was very unwell, {{that he was going to}} have a drop of whiskey neat, and turn in, and that he, <b>the</b> <b>mate,</b> was to take the watch. From this moment the joke lost much of its savour for <b>the</b> <b>mate.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, aye, sir," [...] {{answered}} {{the man at}} the wheel, and the course was changed, for the sailor stood greatly in fear of <b>the</b> <b>mate.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> sent below for another drink of rum.|$|R
5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:00am CST, {{the crew}} {{received}} a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 {{pounds per square}} inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
60|$|Here the doctor, {{in answer}} to <b>the</b> <b>mate's</b> {{repeated}} questions, stepped forward, and related what Bembo had been doing; a matter which <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> but dimly understood from the violent threatenings he had been hearing.|$|R
2500|$|Once the {{hot water}} has been added, <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> is ready for drinking, {{and it may be}} {{refilled}} many times before becoming lavado (washed out) and losing its flavor. When this occurs, the mound of yerba can be pushed {{from one side of the}} gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> for additional refillings and is called [...] "reformar o/el mate" [...] (reforming <b>the</b> <b>mate).</b>|$|R
60|$|He stood {{embracing}} <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> and waiting, but Mr. Heard, with an infuriated exclamation, walked away. A parting glance {{showed him}} {{that the old man}} had released <b>the</b> <b>mate,</b> and that <b>the</b> latter was now embracing Miss Smith.|$|R
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> season, rutting males bellow to {{make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E
60|$|He was {{not allowed}} to proceed any further; {{footsteps}} and a voice were heard above, and as old Thomas hastily extinguished <b>the</b> lamp, <b>the</b> <b>mate’s</b> head was thrust down the scuttle, and <b>the</b> <b>mate’s</b> voice sounded a profane reveillé.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} they made fast to the quay at Llanelly, and half-an-hour later the skipper called <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> down to <b>the</b> cabin, and, handing him some money, {{told him to}} pay the cook off and ship another. <b>The</b> <b>mate</b> declined.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mates</b> {{are one of}} the Kuki {{tribes of}} Manipur, India. <b>The</b> <b>Mates</b> - a name, in its literal sense, connotes front beaters and consequently, in the {{broadest}} sense as a designation, implies a migratory people - are a little-known tribal community of Manipur, India, whose socio-cultural identity as a distinct tribe was only recently recognised by the Union Government of India and the State Government of Manipur. <b>The</b> <b>Mates</b> achieved recognition as a scheduled tribe in January 2012.|$|R
