5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The study also found <b>that</b> <b>California</b> species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline {{may be due to}} loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, <b>that</b> <b>California</b> fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bowers {{returned}} to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, {{and she was}} forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of Nevada and California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed <b>that</b> <b>California</b> would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 cash. For {{the last two years of}} her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to Nevada and buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.|$|E
