500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> now, but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration". Howard focused on Kate [...] "being accustomed to fear and loss" [...] because the character was a military brat.|$|E

6000|$|One of {{the people}} who is often spoken of as if he were doing an {{enormous}} amount of concentrated thinking is [...] "the man in the trenches."

Now that is not at all the impression of the khaki mentality I have reluctantly accepted as correct. For the most part the man in khaki is up against a round of tedious immediate duties that forbid consecutive thought; he is usually rather crowded and not very comfortable. He is bored.|$|E
6000|$|The {{feeling of}} tranquillity which {{had come to}} Betty on her first {{acquaintance}} with Peaceful Moments seemed to deepen as the days went by, and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less vehement. It was still there, but it was dulled. The novelty {{of her life and}} surroundings kept it in check. New York is an egotist. It will suffer no divided attention. [...] "Look at me!" [...] says the voice of the city imperiously, and its children obey. It snatches their thoughts from their inner griefs, and concentrates them on the pageant that rolls unceasingly {{from one end of the}} island to the other. One may despair in New York, but it is difficult to brood on the past; for New York is the City of the Present, the City of <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>Going</b> <b>On.</b>|$|E

It's just as though all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> weren't the things that ought to be going on--but {{something}} else quite different. Somehow one falls into it. It's as if your daily life didn't matter, as if politics didn't matter, as if the King and the social round and business and all those things weren't anything really, and as though you felt there was something else--out of sight--round the corner--that you ought to be getting at. Well, I admit, that's got hold of me too. And it's all mixed up with my idea of you. I don't see that there's really a contradiction in it at all. I'm in love with you, all my heart's in love with you, what's the good of being shy about it? I'd just die for your littlest wish right here now, it's just as though I'd got love in my veins instead of blood, but that's not taking me away from that other thing. It's bringing me round to that other thing. I feel as if without you I wasn't up to anything at all, but with you--We'd not go settling down in a cottage or just touring about with a Baedeker Guide or anything of that kind.
