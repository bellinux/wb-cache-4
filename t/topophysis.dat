5000|$|<b>Topophysis</b> {{occurs when}} scions (young shoots and twigs), buddings, or root {{cuttings}} {{continue to grow}} in the same way after grafting as they had while growing on the ortet. When the scion or propagule grows in the same branchlike way, it is called plagiotropic growth. [...] Orthotropic growth is when the scion begins {{to grow in the}} same upward manner as the ortet. [...] The duration of plagiotropic growth habit depends on the tree species and developmental stage (whether bud or scion) when cut, before the ramet changes to orthotropic growth and matures. This maturation is dependent on the position of the scion growth in relation to the axillary buds. The rate of maturation is decreased in lateral shoots for every order they are removed from the apical meristem and the total distance grown from the apical meristem.|$|E
40|$|The family Araucariaceae {{encompasses}} several {{evergreen forest}} tree species, {{which has a}} high ornamental value due to being a good specimen and having symmetrical branches. Conventional propagation of Araucaria excelsa R. Br. var. glauca by cutting has limited success because of <b>topophysis</b> and difficult-to-root characteristics, and grafting is accompanying incompatibility. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the application of Agrobacterium rhizogenes as well as the IBA, NAA and ancillary compounds potential to increase the rooting of this plant under in vitro condition. Neither ancillary compounds such as salicylic acid, putrescine nor hydrogen peroxide affected the rooting of this recalcitrant species. Subculturing in vitro shoots to MS medium containing 7. 5 Î¼M of both IBA and NAA for 15 days before being moved to hormone-free half-strength MS medium, resulted in a 33 % increase of rooting of shoots each with one or two roots. Using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K 599 improved rooting percentage up to 40 %. Green fluorescents protein (GFP) gene, as a reporter gene, was employed to verify the successful transformation...|$|E
40|$|Baldcypress, Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich., var. distichum is {{a highly}} {{adaptable}} tree of significant ecological importance in the Southeastern U. S. Including Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium (Pondcypress) and Taxodium distichum var. mexicanum (Montezuma cypress), the native range is extended into south Texas and Mexico. Previously, baldcypress selections were made for drought, foliar salt exposure and high pH soil tolerance. Experiments were conducted beginning in May, 2008 to determine commercial viability of vegetative propagation by shoot tip cuttings of these selections, to identify treatment combinations that led to optimal rooted cutting quantity and quality, and to determine whether baldcypress cuttings displayed a topophytic effect and if so, {{if there was a}} correlation between branch angle on the ortet and <b>topophysis</b> exhibited by ramets during nursery production. The propagation studies revealed that rooted cutting quantity and quality were optimal when softwood cuttings were taken from south Texas and/or Mexican provenances and treated with either 7, 500 or 15, 000 mg?L- 1 K-IBA (potassium salts of indole- 3 -butyric acid). A gradient was observed with cuttings from more southern and western provenances typically exhibiting greater rooted cutting quantity and quality than cuttings from more eastern and northern provenances. A tradeoff between greater rooting percentages in a substrate with greater aeration (100 percent perlite) versus greater root quality (root numbers, length, or mass) in a substrate with a higher water-holding capacity (100 percent peat moss) was also displayed. Additional basal wounding proved to be detrimental to both rooted cutting quantity and quality. A significant (P </= 0. 05) topophytic effect was observed among genotypes for the divergence of central leaders from a vertical orientation during nursery production, but the branch angle of the cutting on the ortet was not a good predictor of this divergence on the ramet...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate the vegetative propagation, morphological and molecular variation, and reproductive biology of the Australian native plant species Kunzea pomifera (F. Muell.), Muntries. The species produces an edible berry with potential commercial appeal, and the primary aim {{of the study was}} to determine the potential for its domestication and suitability for commercial production. Collections were made of the species natural populations across its geographical range in south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria. These collections were grown at a single location at Burnley College, Melbourne and were used as the basis for the studies that were considered important for evaluating the species potential for domestication. The capacity for vegetative propagation in K. pomifera was significantly improved with the exogenous application of IBA at concentrations of 1000, 3000 and 5000 ppm compared to no auxin, within a temperature range 16 - 25 C. Significant variation between accessions was found for percentage of rooted cuttings, number of roots and mean root length per rooted cutting, indicating a potential for maximising successful vegetative propagation in commercial cultivars. The production of K. pomifera by grafting, as a scion, on to each of K. ambigua and K. ericoides rootstocks was demonstrated, and was found to offer the potential for the rapid improvement of plant habit and increasing the edaphic tolerances of K. pomifera. The examination of the presence of <b>topophysis</b> in the cuttings of K. pomifera was examined and was found to be transitory and therefore did not appear to be of potential value for the physiological modification of growth habit in its domestication. Leaf morphology (area, length, width, elongation, and stomata, oil-gland and trichome densities) variation in Kunzea pomifera was studied in three natural populations. Significant variation was found within and between populations for all characters, indicating a high probability for such variation in other characters of use for the species domestication, such as fruit size and yield. Molecular variability was also evaluated in these three natural populations using the random amplified polymorphic DNA technique (RAPD). Molecular variation was greatest between individuals within populations, with little population differentiation evident between the three populations. Significant genetic variation between genotypes of K. pomifera indicates the likely variation for characters of potential use in the domestication and improvement of the species for commercial production. Pollen viability and longevity (at 4 C 10 % R. H.) and the onset and duration of stigma receptivity was evaluated in k pomifera. Significant variation in the germination level of pollen was found between genotypes, indicating the potential for breeding cultivars with high pollen viability. No significant correlation was found between germination percentage and storage time over 370 days, indicating that in vitro pollen germination capacity was not significantly affected by such storage. For K. pomifera, the optimum pollination period, for maximising the level of seed set per fruit was found to be ten days (a period from two to eleven days following anthesis). Such a long period of receptivity indicates that artificial pollination would be generally successful for producing hybrids within the species. K pomifera was found to have a very low level of self-compatibility, which was manifest as the prevention in the growth of 'self' pollen-tubes in the style or ovary. Considerable variation was found between genotypes of K. pomifera for the percentage fruit set after artificial hybridisation. This indicates a potential for breeding and selection to maximise yields in commercial cultivars. High interspecific cross-compatibility was found between K. pomifera (U) and K. ambigua (a) wherein seed set per pollinated flower was comparable with the mean value intraspecific crosses. A high level of incongruity, however, was observed between K pomifera (U) and K ericoides (a), which was manifest as the swelling of pollen-tube tips and cessation of growth in the style. Studies of molecular and morphological variation within and between natural populations of Kunzea pomifera (muntries) and its reproductive biology are discussed in terms of its domestication for commercial production, culminating in the proposal of an ideotype for its commercial production. The proposed ideotype for this species grown in southern Australia has a phenotype primarily of upright habit, tolerant of a wide range of soil types, reproductively precocious, regular bearing, with a capacity for high yields of glabrous fruit of consistent size and colour with few seeds and a high pulp:seed ratio, sugar and moisture content. Appropriate breeding and selection procedures are also considered, in terms of their relationship to the further refinement of the specified ideotype characters. It is proposed that such considerations are fundamental to improving the potential for domestication o f Kunzea pomifera. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
