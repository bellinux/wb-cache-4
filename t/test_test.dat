25|$|The {{microphone}} {{features a}} high membrane compliance {{with a large}} backchamber volume, a prepolarized backplane and a high impedance preamplifier located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low acoustic impedance and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability. Close-cell polyurethane foam {{has been found to}} serve the purpose well. In the proposed <b>test,</b> <b>test</b> parameters will be sensitivity, background noise, signal fidelity (harmonic distortion), and temporal stability.|$|E

England went on to lose the game after James Anderson was dismissed in the penultimate ball of the match, meaning England lost the series 1–0.|$|E

25|$|Lockheed Martin {{successfully}} {{conducted the}} first test flight of a prototype NetFires Loitering Attack Missile (LAM) at Eglin Air Force Base, on 11 November 2002. The LAM vertically launched flawlessly, transitioned to stable flight and performed several maneuvers during the short flight <b>test.</b> <b>Test</b> objectives were successfully achieved. The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher. Control surfaces and a pivoting wing deployed as planned as the missile began its programmed assent-phase roll and pitch maneuver. Protective covers on the forward dome, scoring camera and turbojet inlet were ejected properly and engine start sequence began as scheduled. Turbojet ignition sequence completed approximately five seconds after launch, and the engine came up to speed as the prototype approached apogee. For the next eight minutes, the LAM prototype executed preprogrammed maneuvers over the Eglin test range, demonstrating impressive stability and validating aerodynamic performance, navigation and autopilot performance design parameters.|$|E
2500|$|The cited {{language}} differences {{mean that}} it's imperative {{for the test}} to be administered in the subject's native language or a very well mastered second language, and, conversely, the examiner should master the language used in the <b>test.</b> <b>Test</b> responses should also not be translated into another language prior to analysis except possibly by a clinician mastering both languages. For example, a bow tie is a frequent response for the center detail of card III, but since the equivalent term in French translates to [...] "butterfly tie", an examiner not appreciating this language nuance may code the response differently from what is expected.|$|E
2500|$|For {{information}} assurance, CM can {{be defined}} as the management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to hardware, software, firmware, documentation, <b>test,</b> <b>test</b> fixtures, and test documentation throughout the life cycle of an information system. [...] CM for information assurance, sometimes referred to as Secure Configuration Management, relies upon performance, functional, and physical attributes of IT platforms and products and their environments to determine the appropriate security features and assurances that are used to measure a system configuration state. For example, configuration requirements may be different for a network firewall that functions as part of an organization's Internet boundary versus one that functions as an internal local network firewall.|$|E

2500|$|When Abdul Qadir was {{unsuccessful}} against India in 1987 and Iqbal Qasim {{rejoined the}} team, Tauseef ended up joining the latter at Bangalore. India's defensive approach {{was based on}} playing the waiting game on slow turners expecting the inexperienced Pakistani batting line-up (with just Imran and Miandad having played more than 30 tests) to crumble at some point [...] For four tests, they waited until at Bangalore, Kapil Dev, having led India to two 2–0 wins (against England (away) and against Sri Lanka (at home), came under immense pressure to get a result. Both captains misread the wicket: Pakistanis played the left-arm fast-bowler Saleem Jaffer who would not bowl a ball in the match. Imran won the toss and batted and Tauseef's glorious run began; he scored a crucial unbeaten 15 in the first innings enabling Pakistanis to cross 100 and then sparked the fighback by bowling Krish Srikkanth and Sunil Gavaskar through the gate that very day. Pakistanis, after getting bowled out for just 116, in spun India out for just 145 with both Tauseef and Iqbal Qasim getting five wickets each. In the second innings, Tauseef's all-round skills reached a peak when {{he was part of}} the only 50-run partnership of the match, his own share being just 10, as Pakistanis set India a target of 221 to win. That day would end with Tauseef firing out Dilip Vengsarkar and Kiran More. The next day, Pakistanis, hunting for the remaining six wickets, got four through Iqbal Qasim, including that of the threatening Sunil Gavaskar, before Tauseef's sharp-spinning off break went through Shivlal Yadav's defences. Roger Binny hit back with a massive six of Tauseef who was surprised when Imran handed the ball to him to have another go. He did and so did Binny and could only manage an inside edge to Saleem Yousuf who gobbled it up to give Pakistanis their first-ever test series win in India. Like first <b>test</b> <b>test,</b> Tauseef had shared 18 wickets with Iqbal Qasim except that this time round, both had nine each with crucial runs to boot.|$|E
