5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. The 9th ICTV Report defines {{the concept of}} the virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. However, at present {{only a small part of}} the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E

25|$|The Bay {{is famous}} for its rockfish, a {{regional}} name for striped bass. Once on the verge of extinction, rockfish have made a significant comeback because of legislative action <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on rockfishing, which allowed the species to re-populate. Rockfish can now be fished in strictly controlled and limited quantities.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{measures}} {{that might be}} used, there was high agreement and much evidence that policies <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> price {{on the cost of}} carbon emissions could provide incentives for consumers and producers. Carbon prices of 5 to 65 US$/t in 2030 and 15 to 130 US$/t by 2050 are envisaged for stabilization at around 550 ppm by 2100.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{presented}} an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> premium on basic human rights and democratization. In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty {{was not to be}} violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.|$|E
25|$|Land reform {{measures}} were passed in 1919 and 1925 {{under pressure from}} an impoverished peasantry. They were partially implemented, but resulted in the parcellation of only 20% of the great agricultural estates. Poland endured numerous economic calamities and disruptions in the early 1920s, including waves of workers' strikes such as the 1923 Kraków riot. The German–Polish customs war, initiated by Germany in 1925, {{was one of the}} most damaging external factors <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> strain on Poland's economy. On the other hand, there were also signs of progress and stabilization, for example a critical reform of finances carried out by the competent government of Władysław Grabski, which lasted almost two years. Certain other achievements of the democratic period having to do with the management of governmental and civic institutions necessary to the functioning of the reunited state and nation were too easily overlooked. Lurking on the sidelines was a disgusted army officer corps unwilling to subject itself to civilian control, but ready to follow the retired Piłsudski, who was highly popular with Poles and just as dissatisfied with the Polish system of government as his former colleagues in the military.|$|E
500|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 88 Emeco chair models.

It has a similar silhouette as the original 1006, but has a reflective or brushed aluminum surface, a solid backrest and is stackable. It also came in swivel and upholstered versions. The reflective glossy versions of the 1006 chair are polished for eight hours, substantially increasing their cost. There are also Emeco-brand barstools, swivel chairs, rocking chairs and armchairs.|$|E

500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and felt that, {{as the show}} lost viewers in the first season, the stories got better, and that [...] "Diversity Day" [...] is an {{excellent}} example of this [...] "unfortunate trend". He noted that the episode [...] "would go on {{to be one of the}} series’ defining episodes, an installment <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> more hopeful spin on the original Offices views on accepting the disparity between our dreams and our realities." [...] However, Adams noted that Carell's character was still too aggressive for Michael Scott to be completely lovable, and that the second season episode [...] "Sexual Harassment" [...] would serve as [...] "a gentler spiritual sequel" [...] to this episode, featuring a similar premise, but with a softened Michael Scott. For his work on this episode, B. J. Novak was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E
500|$|A {{professional}} deposit banker (argentarius, coactor argentarius, {{or later}} nummularius) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers, making loans from their personal fortunes {{on the basis}} of social connections. The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked [...] "paper" [...] or documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire also permitted the exchange of very large sums without the physical transfer of coins, {{in part because of the}} risks of moving large amounts of cash, particularly by sea. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, a credit crisis in 33 AD <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> number of senators at risk; the central government rescued the market through a loan of 100 million HS made by the emperor Tiberius to the banks (mensae). Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers. The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.|$|E
500|$|Now {{augmented}} by reinforcements from the UK, the Mediterranean Fleet detached Illustrious, four cruisers, and four destroyers {{to a point}} [...] south-east of Taranto. The first wave of a dozen aircraft, all that the ship could launch at one time, flew off by 20:40 and the second wave of nine by 21:34. Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three-quarter moon. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had positioned a Short Sunderland flying boat off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17:55 by acoustic locators and again at 20:40, alerting the defenders. The noise of the on-coming first airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the antiaircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterward, as did those on the ships in the harbour. The torpedo-carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship [...] and two on the recently completed battleship [...] while the two flare droppers bombed the oil storage depot with little effect. The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer [...] with one bomb that failed to detonate. The destroyer , or Conte di Cavour, shot down the aircraft <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> torpedo into the latter ship, but the remaining aircraft returned to Illustrious.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in a November 15, 1953 {{game against}} the 49ers, Otto Graham took an elbow from linebacker Art Michalik <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> gash on his face {{requiring}} 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic mask and he was sent back on the field. While the use of face masks was not unheard-of – Y.A. Tittle was using one that season as he nursed a fractured cheekbone – the injury contributed to their development. Brown is often credited with inventing and patenting the single-bar face mask. Riddell, a sports equipment manufacturer, claims the [...] "bar tubular" [...] mask was invented by G.E. Morgan for Graham in 1955, although {{by the end of}} that year many players were already wearing some form of face protection.|$|E
2500|$|Hood Canal marks {{an abrupt}} change of {{physiography}} between the Puget Lowland and the Olympic Mountains to the west. [...] Based {{on this and}} geophysical anomalies it was inferred {{that there is a}} major, active strike-slip fault zone running from the south end of Hood Canal, up Dabob Bay, and continuing north on land. This is conformable with some regional tectonic interpretations <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> major terrane boundary between the Olympics and the Puget Lowland, and imply a connection (either via the Discovery Bay Fault, or closer to Port Townsend) to the various faults in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. [...] This boundary would be the contact where northward movement of the basement rock of the Puget Lowland against the Olympic Peninsula is accommodated; it would be expected to be a significant seismological zone.|$|E
2500|$|Puzzle {{adventure}} {{games are}} adventure games <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> {{strong emphasis on}} logic puzzles. They typically emphasize self-contained puzzle challenges with logic puzzle toys or games. Completing each puzzle opens more of the game's world to explore, additional puzzles to solve, and can expand on the game's story. There are often few to none non-playable characters in such games, and lack the type of inventory puzzles that typical point-and-click adventure games have. Puzzle adventure games were popularized by Myst and The 7th Guest. These both used mixed media consisting of pre-rendered images and movie clips, but since then, puzzle adventure games {{have taken advantage of}} modern game engines to present the games in full 3D settings, such as The Talos Principle. Myst itself has been recreated in such a fashion in the title realMyst. Other puzzle adventure games are casual adventure games made up series of puzzles used to explore and progress the story, exemplified by The Witness and the [...] Professor Layton series of games.|$|E

2500|$|Censorship of the press: Bolshevik {{strategy}} {{from the}} beginning was to introduce censorship over the primary medium of information in the former Russian Empire in 1917, the newspaper. The provisional government, born out of the March Revolution against the tsarist regime, abolished the age-old practice of censoring the press. This created free newspapers that survived on their own revenue. The Bolsheviks' power over the provisional government lay in the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, because they could shut down industry and government by calling in workers and soldiers to strike and demonstrate. This ability to orchestrate strikes was especially helpful in the newspaper printing factories because a strike would mean a large loss in revenue, and the inability to continue to operate. The capability of strikes allowed the Bolsheviks to shut down any newspaper they wanted, creating a highly effective censorship mechanism <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> stop {{to the voice of}} the opposition. Lenin took control of the socialist newspaper Pravda, making it an outlet to spread Bolshevik agitprop, articles, and other media. With the Bolshevik capability to censor and shut down newspapers of opposing or rival factions, Pravda was able to become the dominant source of written information for the population in regions controlled by the Red Army [...]|$|E
