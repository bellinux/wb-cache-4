2500|$|Trapezoidal thread {{forms are}} screw thread {{profiles}} with trapezoidal outlines. They {{are the most}} common forms used for leadscrews (power screws). They offer high strength and ease of manufacture. They are typically found where large loads are required, as in a vise or <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> of a lathe. Standardized variations include multiple-start threads, left-hand threads, and self-centering threads (which are less likely to bind under lateral forces).|$|E

25|$|Rarely, {{thread cutting}} or {{grinding}} (usually the latter) {{will be followed}} by thread lapping in order to achieve the highest precision and surface finish achievable. This is a toolroom practice when the highest precision is required, rarely employed except for <b>the</b> <b>leadscrews</b> or ballscrews of high-end machine tools.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{applications}} use a knuckle thread's rounded {{edges to}} reduce the stress on softer materials at a point of connection. Some linear actuators use a knuckle thread {{to reduce the}} wear of <b>the</b> steel <b>leadscrew</b> against a plastic sliding nut. Firefighting respirator standard EN 148-1 [...] "Respiratory protective devices - Threads for facepieces" [...] lists a knuckle thread to connect metal and rubber parts.|$|R
40|$|From their {{research}} and development in hard x-ray lithography, the authors have found that <b>the</b> conventional <b>leadscrew</b> driven scanner stages do not provide adequate scan speed or travel. These considerations have led the authors to develop a scanning system based on a long stroke hydraulic drive with 635 mm of travel and closed loop feedback to position the stage to better than 100 micrometers. The control of the device is through a PC with a custom LabView interface coupled to simple x-ray beam diagnostics. This configuration allows one to set a variety of scan parameters, including target dose, scan range, scan rates, and dose rate. Results from the prototype system at beamline X- 27 B are described as well as progress on a production version for the X- 14 B beamline...|$|R
50|$|There was proper {{shielding}} of {{the operator}} from chuck contact, coolant and flying swarf. Both leadscrews ran in sealed oil baths. The apron {{was of a}} totally novel design. <b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> engaged with a worm wheel {{instead of the usual}} halfnuts. The apron gear system could engage every metric and imperial thread directly and automatically. <b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> could be disengaged for each cut without losing register. This made it easy to turn and thread directly against an endstop, even into blind holes. Accordingly, the lathe was equipped with an assortment of endstops both for the saddle and crossfeed. The endstop trip mechanism had a sensitive adjustment. There was a foot-operated emergency stop and spindle brake.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> has {{a collar}} {{in which the}} load rides on then the {{frictional}} forces between the interface must be accounted for in the torque calculations as well. For the following equation the load {{is assumed to be}} concentrated at the mean collar diameter (dc): ...|$|E
50|$|The {{buttress}} thread form, {{also known as}} the breech-lock thread form, refers to two different thread profiles. One is a type of leadscrew and the other is a type of hydraulic sealing thread form. <b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and <b>leadscrews).</b> <b>The</b> seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope. Tapered thread joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} {{tailstock}} is {{moved to the}} approximate position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a <b>leadscrew</b> to <b>the</b> exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this <b>leadscrew.</b> <b>The</b> tailstock quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse taper mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the end of}} World War I, {{machine tool}} control {{advanced}} in various ways that {{laid the groundwork for}} later CNC technology. The jig borer popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in [...] "tenths" [...] (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for servos that worked <b>the</b> machine <b>leadscrews</b> or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of antibacklash leadscrew nuts. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.|$|R
50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one {{leadscrew}} that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For screw cutting, a half nut is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed.|$|E
50|$|A {{split nut}} {{assembly}} {{is often used}} in positioning systems, for example in <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> of a lathe. It {{is one of the}} machine elements that makes single-point threading practical on manual (non-CNC) lathes. The very earliest screw-cutting lathes (in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) did not have them, but within a few decades, split nuts were common on lathes.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, English {{instrument}} maker Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800) {{was working}} on the toolmaking and [...] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing <b>the</b> trifecta of <b>leadscrew,</b> slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.|$|R
40|$|A {{frequently}} repeated {{machine element}} {{in almost every}} mechanical design, regardless {{of the field of}} use, is <b>the</b> power screw (<b>leadscrew).</b> It`s main purpose is to transform rotary motion into linear, and vice versa, whereat the last mentioned option is rarely used since self-locking of the power screw is no longer provided. Every machine element has different advantages and disadvantages but all come together in one unique technical parameter which is valid for every machine, the degree of efficiency. Irrespective of many advantages power screws have, it`s wider use in other applications is restricted due to it`s low degree of efficiency. This paper should give some theoretical proposals on how to increase the degree of efficiency on power screws. Authors present several ways to increase the degree of efficiency by starting to increase the pitch, changing the thread geometry (profile), assuming a lower coefficient of drag, using multi-start screws and finally giving a suggestion which includes a combination of some mentioned solutions. It is important to emphasize that all mentioned suggestions are solutions through out the design of power screws, not considering tribological phenomenons like coefficient of drag or used material...|$|R
50|$|The {{slide rest}} (as the {{earliest}} forms of carriage were known) {{can be traced}} to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting slide rest with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry. In the eighteenth century the slide rest was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had slide rests. The story has long circulated that Henry Maudslay invented it, but he did not (and never claimed so). The legend that Maudslay invented the slide rest originated with James Nasmyth, who wrote ambiguously about it in his Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle, 1841; later writers misunderstood, and propagated the error. However, Maudslay did help to disseminate the idea widely. It is highly probable that he saw it when he was working at the Arsenal as a boy. In 1794, whilst he was working for Joseph Bramah, he made one, and when he had his own workshop used it extensively in the lathes he made and sold there. Coupled with the network of engineers he trained, this ensured the slide rest became widely known and copied by other lathe makers, and so diffused throughout British engineering workshops. A practical and versatile screw-cutting lathe incorporating <b>the</b> trio of <b>leadscrew,</b> change gears, and slide rest was Maudslay's most important achievement.|$|R
50|$|The bed is {{a robust}} base that {{connects to the}} {{headstock}} and permits the carriage and tailstock to be moved parallel with the axis of the spindle. This is facilitated by hardened and ground bedways which restrain the carriage and tailstock in a set track. The carriage travels {{by means of a}} rack and pinion system. <b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> of accurate pitch, drives the carriage holding the cutting tool via a gearbox driven from the headstock.|$|E
50|$|This was the {{temperature}} machine. It {{consisted of a}} long rotating drum (perhaps 18 inches long). Recorded on the drum were a series of temperatures (minus 40 °F to 120 °F, or &minus;40 °C to 50 °C). A single soundhead was attached to a lead screw. A thermometer was placed {{on top of the}} telephone company central office and connected to the Audichron temperature machine. This would cause <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> to rotate and position the soundhead on top of the correct temperature recording.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> will be {{manufactured}} to either imperial or metric standards and {{will require a}} conversion ratio to be introduced to create thread forms from a different family. To accurately convert from one thread form to the other requires a 127-tooth gear, or on lathes not large enough to mount one, an approximation may be used. Multiples of 3 and 7 giving a ratio of 63:1 {{can be used to}} cut fairly loose threads. This conversion ratio is often built into the quick change gearboxes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{screw-cutting}} lathe is {{a machine}} (specifically, a lathe) capable of cutting very accurate screw threads via single-point screw-cutting, {{which is the}} process of guiding the [...] motion of the tool bit in a precisely known ratio to the rotating motion of the workpiece. This is accomplished by gearing <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> (which drives the tool bit's movement) to the spindle with a certain gear ratio for each thread pitch. Every degree of spindle rotation is matched by a certain distance of linear tool travel, depending on the desired thread pitch (English or metric, fine or coarse, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Two {{parallel}} guide rods that run between upper left and lower {{right in the}} photo carry the [...] "sled", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this [...] "sled" [...] is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes {{at the edge of}} the disc. To move the [...] "sled" [...] during continuous read or write operations, a stepper motor rotates a leadscrew to move the [...] "sled" [...] throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. <b>The</b> <b>leadscrew</b> is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the [...] "sled".|$|E
50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle and gear train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|E
5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew</b> or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|E
5000|$|Various machine {{elements}} that potentially lent themselves to screw making (such as the lathe, <b>the</b> <b>leadscrew,</b> the slide rest, gears, slide rests geared direct to spindles, and [...] "change gear" [...] gear trains) were {{developed over the}} centuries, {{with some of those}} elements being quite ancient. Various sparks of inventive power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance combined some of these elements into screw-making machines that presaged the industrial era to follow. For example, various medieval inventors whose names are lost to history clearly worked on the problem, as shown by Wolfegg Castle's Medieval Housebook (written circa 1475-1490), and Leonardo da Vinci and Jacques Besson left us with drawings of screw-cutting machines from the 1500s; not all of these designs are known to have been built, but clearly similar machines were a reality during Besson's lifetime. However, {{it was not until the}} era of 1760-1800 that these various elements were brought together successfully to create (in contemporaneous parallel) two new types of machine tool: the screw-cutting lathe (for low-volume, toolroom-style production of machine screws, with easy selection of various pitches) and the first high-volume-production, specialized, single-purpose machine tools for the production of screws, which were created to produce wood screws screws made of metal for use in wood at high volume and low unit price. Screw-cutting lathes fed into the just-dawning evolution of modern machine shop practice, whereas the wood-screw-making machines fed into the just-dawning evolution of the modern hardware industry, that is, the concept of one factory supplying the needs of thousands of customers, who consumed screws in growing quantities for carpentry, cabinet making, and other trades, but did not make the hardware themselves (purchasing it instead from capital-intensive specialist makers for lower unit cost than they could achieve on their own). These two classes of machine tools simultaneously took the various classes of screws and moved them, for the first time, from the category of expensive, hand-made, seldom-used objects into the category of affordable, often-interchangeable commodity. (The interchangeability developed gradually, from intra-company to inter-company to national to international).|$|E
