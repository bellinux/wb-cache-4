5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E

40|$|In this research, a {{localized}} surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) immunosensor {{based on}} gold-capped nanoparticle substrate for detecting casein, {{one of the}} most potent allergens in milk, was developed. The fabrication of the gold-capped nanoparticle substrate involved a surface-modified silica nanoparticle layer (core) on <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> substrate between bottom and top gold layers (shell). The absorbance peak of the gold-capped nanoparticle substrate was observed at ~ 520 nm. In addition, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images demonstrated that the nanoparticles formed a monolayer on <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> <b>glass.</b> After immobilizing anti-casein antibody on the surface, our device, casein immunosensor, could be applied easily for the detection of casein in the raw milk sample without a difficult pretreatment. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limit of the casein immunosensor was determined as 10 ng/mL. Our device brings several advantages to the existing LSPR-based biosensors with its easy fabrication, simple handling, low-cost, and high sensitivity...|$|R
25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E

2500|$|House {{pictures}} were released on June 27, 2007. The house has an Alice in Wonderland theme and contains an over sized bedroom {{and a small}} bedroom. The small bedroom features a very small doorway and five beds which are only five feet long, while the over sized bedroom features shoulder-height beds and enormous drawers which need a ladder to reach. A third bedroom is decorated all in red, and two large, round beds sit {{in the center of}} the room. The walkway to the Head of Household room is a modernist inspired enchanted forest. The living room features several colored mirrors, varying in shape and size. The living room is connected to the kitchen, which is connected to the HoH stairway and a hallway. There is one door in the hallway, which features a gym available to the HouseGuests. The hallway then leads to the bathroom, which features a lavish blue wall, and a shower which features a lion-shaped water spout. The backyard contains animal-shaped topiaries, flowers, a swimming pool, and a spinning teacup, which the HouseGuests can sit in.

40|$|Abstract A novel route was {{introduced}} to synthesize dense polyacrylamide (PAM) onto <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> surface. To in-vestigate the surface chemistry of the PAM on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>slides,</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to obtain detailed chemical state information on the PAM layer constituents.

Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope data indicated the presence of PAM on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>slides,</b> which consist of nodules.
