5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System <b>tracking</b> <b>unit</b> expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E
25|$|Tracking Troop {{was also}} sedulous and {{operated}} out of Base Group {{in the same}} manner as Signals Troop; a number of specialist trackers would be attached to a Commando as/when required to be dropped onto spoor for follow-up work. The new Selous Scouts Regiment had requested some specialist trackers for a combative <b>tracking</b> <b>unit,</b> so Tracking Troop was disbanded and a distinct home found for everyone concerned — primarily within the Selous Scouts unit and RLI, but also the SAS (Rhodesian Special Air Service). The majority were transmigrated to Support Group where they eventually became known as Reconnaissance Troop after the change to a Commando was actualised.|$|E
25|$|After {{the protagonist}} {{receives}} his second tattoo, he and Ora are tasked to {{take revenge on}} the PMCs responsible for {{the attack on the}} dojo: a corporation called Hessian, run by a ruthless Eastern European plutocrat named Count Karajan. Meanwhile, the horishi artist Dosan expresses concern over the tattoo ink's quality and promises to learn why Azai has not procured a fresh supply. The protagonist invades Hessian's East Asian regional headquarters and murders Corporal Kelly, the Hessian employee who lead the attack on the dojo, and, using a stolen GPS <b>tracking</b> <b>unit,</b> stalks Karajan to his castle in Eastern Europe and slays him. Upon returning home, the protagonist and Ora see that their clan has stolen a great deal of high tech military equipment from Hessian, leaving them to realize that Azai's plan had been to rob Karajan and replace the old Hisomu Path with a modern, technological approach to espionage. Instead of committing seppuku, the protagonist flees with Ora to find Dosan, who had left a message indicating that he had personally gone in search of the mysterious desert flower.|$|E

Based on the serial number, the police can obtain a physical description of the vehicle, including make (brand), model, color, VIN, and license plate number.

50|$|A GPS <b>tracking</b> <b>unit</b> is a device, {{normally}} {{carried by}} a moving vehicle or person, {{that uses the}} Global Positioning System to determine and track its precise location, and hence that of its carrier, at intervals. The recorded location data can be stored within the <b>tracking</b> <b>unit,</b> {{or it may be}} transmitted to a central location database, or Internet-connected computer, using a cellular (GPRS or SMS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit. This allows the asset's location to be displayed against a map backdrop either in real time or when analysing the track later, using GPS tracking software. Data tracking software is available for smartphones with GPS capability.|$|E
