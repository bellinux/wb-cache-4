40|$|Many {{pathogens}} {{are maintained}} by multiple host species and involve multiple strains with potentially different phenotypic characteristics. Disentangling transmission patterns in such systems is often challenging, yet investigating how different host species contribute to transmission {{is crucial to}} properly assess and manage disease risk. We aim to reveal <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> of bacteria within the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, which include Lyme disease agents.

In contrast, the cycle involving native bank voles only accounts for a small proportion of infected ticks. Genotypes associated with the two primary <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> were isolated from Lyme disease patients, confirming the epidemiological threat posed by these strains.

30|$|The gateway {{selection}} algorithm {{was tested}} using the wireless link emulator in different scenario’s {{in order to identify}} limitations. For this purpose, we increased the number of containers in every iteration, always adding one container at the border of the stack. We also considered two positions for the gateway, one {{in the middle of the}} stack (best-case) and one at the border of the stack (worst-case). We discovered that the gateway selection starts to fail when working on the boundary of the wireless range. In the worst-case gateway position with six containers, we observed that only 10 % of the <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> 1 was successful. Since this is a common scenario in real-life, we have added an RSSI filter, avoiding that tracking devices select a gateway to which they have a too low-quality link. After applying the RSSI filter, the network size is limited to five containers on each side of the gateway. We still noticed that for the device on the far edge of the stack 20 % of the <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> failed. Using its built-in fallback mechanism, the device used its own UMTS/GPRS module to report to the cloud. All other devices could successfully complete nearly all <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R

25|$|When it was {{introduced}} in World War II, DDT was effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the <b>transmission</b> <b>cycle,</b> was initially successful as well. For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and {{the first quarter of}} 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use.

25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} herd immunity. For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the <b>transmission</b> <b>cycle</b> of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E

Eighty percent of 1. 2 million severe dengue cases occurred when mean temperature was 27 – 29. 5 °C and mean humidity was> 75 %. Interventions are most effective when applied early.

40|$|International audienceLeptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease of medical concern worldwide, {{and particularly in}} several islands of the Indian Ocean. Recent investigations have revealed distinct <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> in the different islands of this region, notably in Madagascar and on the two French islands of Mayotte and La Reunion. From an evolutionary perspective, these investigations have shown the presence of distinct bacterial assemblages in the different insular ecosystems. Indeed, Madagascar hosts a unique diversity of pathogenic Leptospira in its wild fauna, including one endemic species introduced to the neighbouring Mayotte Island, where it is responsible for {{an important part of}} acute infections in humans. By contrast, on Reunion Island, human leptospirosis results from a much narrower diversity of cosmopolitan Leptospira that are likely of recent introduction. From a prevention standpoint, data produced on the French islands of Indian Ocean reveal that rats are not the only animals at play in human transmission, but rather support an important role of other introduced animal taxa, among which dogs deserve special attention. Altogether, these studies, based on a One Health conceptual Framework show that the investigation of the environmental approach of a given zoonosis highlights the <b>transmission</b> <b>cycles</b> at work in a given ecosystem, and hence helps guiding the control measures to be implemented at each specific environment...|$|R
