30|$|The {{conventional}} “zoning-integrative” type of <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> is not {{the only}} application available. Actually, there is no necessary connection between <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> and zoning as such. In a different perspective, <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> can be conceived in terms of alternatives to zoning—rather than as mere adjuncts (Chiodelli and Moroni 2016). “Zoning-alternative” <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> are a device in their own right, independent from zoning. In this case, the local government’s role is restricted to deciding the overall development quantity to be permitted (through the decision on how many <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> to allocate). Once this overall quantity has been decided, <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> are automatically allocated with an identical ratio (e.g., Y development units per acre) (Chiodelli and Moroni 2016). The real estate market is subsequently free to re-allocate those rights among landowners (Thorsnes and Simons 1999). The municipality may decide to draw a distinction between involved areas and non-involved areas. No further distinction (e.g., between sending areas and receiving areas) will be envisaged. Clearly, all the transfers must be carried out without violating the relational rules indicated above (for instance, where the <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> “make landfall” and amass).|$|R
40|$|New Zealand's Fourth Labour Government {{undertook}} radical {{reforms of}} the public sector during the mid 1980 s. This Government implemented policy changes associated with the neo-liberal ideology, resulting in re-regulation of the national economy and an affirmation {{of the role of the}} market in decision-making. The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) is a product of this changing political environment; it recognises market forces as legitimate methods of resource allocation and resolution of land-use conflicts. This thesis investigates the potential of using economic instruments, in the form of transferable planning mechanisms, to allocate water and land resources under the RMA. Specifically, <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> and <b>transferable</b> water <b>rights</b> are examined in the context of achieving desirable environmental outcomes. The RMA promotes sustainability in the management of natural and physical resources through the concept of sustainable management. Any policy using <b>transferable</b> <b>rights</b> to achieve planning objectives is required to meet sustainable management criteria. This thesis explores issues associated with the adoption of <b>transferable</b> <b>rights</b> as planning techniques. The exploratory nature of the research reflects the limited application of such mechanisms in practice in New Zealand. Transferable planning mechanisms were conceived and first implemented in the United States, which provides a base for defining principles and evaluating practice. Commentary on the American experience is used in the thesis to gauge the potential benefits of using transferable planning mechanisms in New Zealand. Three New Zealand-based case studies were examined in the empirical phase of research. The case study analysis concluded that <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> can be exercised in New Zealand's rural-urban fringe environments in the form of <b>transferable</b> title <b>rights.</b> This adjustment to the <b>transferable</b> development <b>right</b> concept is a result of New Zealand's more restrictive institutional environment (when compared to the United States) with regard to landowners' development <b>rights.</b> However, <b>transferable</b> title <b>rights</b> can only function effectively under certain conditions. There must be a positive demand differential between the areas of preservation and development, in favour of the designated receiving area of title rights. This is the greatest impediment to the successful implementation of <b>transferable</b> title <b>rights</b> in New Zealand. The thesis research highlights that, there is extensive scope for the effective use of <b>transferable</b> water <b>rights</b> in New Zealand; these have fewer logistical problems and greater market certainty than the application of <b>transferable</b> title <b>rights.</b> Planners should recognise the potential use of nonattenuated property rights as a means of allocating resources sustainably and reducing externalities in resource use decision-making...|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} in the past water had been treated as common goods which was {{supposed}} to be equally available to all members of the social community. Nevertheless, throughout the time, circumstances have changed. The emergence and incremental strengthening of an individual ownership have contributed to the transformation of social relations being established with regard to the use of water resources. Owners of immovable property immediately connected to the sources, are, pursuant to the principle of priority, entitled to use the water for their needs and those of their households (prior tempore, potior iure). According to the traditional view, the neighbours were obliged to restrain from the use of water, up until the property owner met his needs, within the limits of the so called regular use. Following the same logic, a privileged owner of the immovable property could also demand from all other persons not to interfere with his use of water resources (ius excludendi tertii). Namely, entitlement to use water was of an accessory nature and it belonged to the corpus of ownership right, which could, as an absolute right, be enforced against anybody (erga omnes). Later on an independent and <b>transferable</b> <b>right</b> to use water resources was established and its holders could become a state, a local community, a private legal and natural person, regardless of the ownership right over an immovable property connected to the water resource. Meanwhile the understanding of the right of ownership has substantially changed. It is no longer considered an absolute in its original sense. Constitutions of some countries and decisions of the highest national and supranational courts stipulate that the ownership has a social function and that it may be limited in the public interest. Likewise, an entitlement to use water resources may be restricted in the interest of social community, and as the practice of some countries testifies, also in the interest of other natural and legal persons. This view, inter alia, is supported by different forms of public-private partnerships. The right of an immovable property owner to use the water resources could additionally be restricted by recognising the universal human right to water. Connected therewith, the legal theory abounds with dilemmas. The most prominent is the one concerning the existence of such a universal human right. Some authors argue that it does not exist, but that it has been emerging. Other writers contend that it is implicitly contained, id est, derived from the exiting human rights, whereas some take a stand that it is a sui generis right. The paper offers a comprehensive analyses of the documents adopted by the United Nations and the Council of Europe, jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights along with the regulation of the European Union and the Republic of Serbia on that matter. Introducing the universal human right to water has a special significance in the present time. There are two main reasons for that. The first one presents the possibility of horizontal application of human rights in civil law relations (constitutionalisation), which may cause narrowing of the ownership right in the interest of other persons. The second one are mass migrations triggered by climate change, global warming and water scarcity. In such circumstances, an adequate legal policy shall be identified, based on an all-encompassing scientific research, followed by adopting the corresponding regulation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{activities}} conducted on land surrounding the Chesapeake Bay directly affect pollution {{levels in the}} Bay, and they do so in complex and varied ways. Policy attention has been focused, for the most part, on modifying these activities within a particular land use category but not on wholesale changes in land use. For example, farmers are encouraged to use “best management practices” (BMPs) that focus on fertilizer use, crop covers, and the like; residential and commercial developers are encouraged to manage stormwater runoff; and wastewater treatment plants are required to meet technology-based standards. But the amount of land in urbanized uses relative to the amount in farming, forestry, and open space has not been given the attention it deserves. In this paper, we discuss the ways that land use affects pollution in the Bay. We then analyze three economic incentive-based policies {{that could be used}} to alter land use patterns—purchase of development <b>rights</b> (PDRs), <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> (TDRs), and development impact fees. The strengths and weaknesses of each policy are discussed. Finally, we discuss the issue of policy coordination, i. e., synchronizing policies focused directly on land use, such as TDRs, with input-based taxes.

40|$|For {{ecological}} and economic reasons {{it is more}} cost effective to conserve habitats rather than species, and hence biodiversity conservation becomes a land use issue. Since in developing countries, land {{is the most important}} productive asset, the opportunity costs of conservation are forgone development, while the benefits from conservation are distant and largely external to the host country. The concept of <b>transferable</b> development <b>rights</b> (TDRs), which has been extensively applied to conservation of historical buildings in urban areas, is extended and adapted here to the conservation of biodiversity, both within a country and globally. Creation of a market for TDRs makes effective the latent demand for and supply of biodiversity conservation and generates benefits for both the supplier (developing countries) and the demander (developed countries). The paper explores the conditions and public interventions necessary for the creation of an active market for TDRs. It also proposes a number of mechanisms such as credits and offsets for purchase of TDRs against domestic regulations and conservation taxes in the developed countries.

40|$|This paper explores some {{theoretical}} and practical issues in developing policy {{for the management of}} shared fisheries for maximum value. Maximisation of value from the use of resources is a key component of sustainability, and <b>transferable</b> <b>rights</b> in commercial fisheries management have contributed significantly toward this goal. Maximising value becomes more difficult in fisheries shared among commercial, amateur, and indigenous customary users, where rights of access and values gained from fishing differ in kind between these groups. Management of stock abundance and catch allocation between sectors both affect the total value achievable from a fishery. The components of value in these attributes for each sector and the basis for optimisation discussed. However, the practical aspects of optimisation across sectors pose some difficulties. Two approaches to the problem are discussed: the information approach and the market approach. It seems both face considerable challenges. Information is expensive to collect and methods that will provide reasonable accuracy seem difficult to identify in the New Zealand context. Market approaches appear promising but face problems of political and stakeholder acceptance. Conclusions on a practical way forward include the need for transparent, collaborative multi-stakeholder approaches among sector representatives and government agencies...|$|R

To meet {{a new set of}} challenges the current licensing system based on the allocation of non-transferable, variable duration licences to individual vessels is being replaced by a system of long-term individual <b>transferable</b> <b>rights</b> owned by Falkland Islanders. The anticipated gains are enhanced economic performance of the sector because fishing businesses have increased security and flexibility, rapid diversification from harvesting into value-added activities and increased international competitiveness as poorly performing companies sell rights to well performing companies. Implementing a rights-based regime in a small coastal state is challenging. Thin markets for rights, a desire to maintain local control of fishing rights, and a dependence on foreign direct investment in the fisheries sector are key considerations in the design of an effective and efficient management regime. Starting operation in 2006 / 07, the new rights-based management system provides a model for small coastal states or small industrial fisheries that previously had considered rights-based systems too complex to implement and administer, despite the inherent advantages of rights-based management.
