5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> they defeat Discord, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooner</b> defense played {{extremely}} well in Waco, limiting Baylor to 148total yards and -48yards of rushing. That was the fewest yards Baylor had produced all season and their worst {{performance on the}} ground in the program's history; it was also the second-best performance by an Oklahoma defense ever. Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|On November 10, Guy Morriss {{brought his}} Baylor Bears to Norman {{to take on}} <b>the</b> <b>Sooners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> had never lost to the Bears, going 16–0 since the first game between the two teams in 1901 (with the second game being in 1973). In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> held <b>the</b> Bears to −48yards total rushing. However, {{the last time the}} Bears were in Norman, they took <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> to double {{overtime}} before Oklahoma finally pulled out the win. Under Bob Stoops, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> had outscored <b>the</b> Bears 287–76.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{gymnastics}} {{team was}} founded in 1981 under head coach Paul Ziert, who led <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> to three regional championships and two NCAA tournament appearances. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> won their first five conference titles beginning in 1984 under coach Becky Switzer. Steve Nunno added another Big 12 title in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The {{last time}} <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> and <b>the</b> Hurricanes had competed {{was in the}} 1988 Orange Bowl. Miami won 20-14 and earned its second {{national}} championship. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> are 27-5 against current ACC members with three of those losses to <b>the</b> Hurricanes. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> entered <b>the</b> game favored by between 10 and 11 points.|$|R
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, perhaps due to improved prehospital care or specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E
5|$|Two private {{institutions}} in Tulsa, the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University; are also Division I members. Tulsa competes in FBS football and other {{sports in the}} American Athletic Conference, while Oral Roberts, which does not sponsor football, {{is a member of}} The Summit League. In addition, 12 of the state's smaller colleges and universities compete in NCAA Division II as members of four different conferences, and eight other Oklahoma institutions participate in the NAIA, mostly within <b>the</b> <b>Sooner</b> Athletic Conference.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Sooners {{competed with}} a {{relatively}} young team. Oklahoma listed 72players on the roster and only nine of them were scholarship seniors. Following the dismissal of quarterback Rhett Bomar, fifth-year senior Paul Thompson reconverted back to his former role of quarterback after spending 2005 as a wide receiver. Junior college transfer Joey Halzle was slotted as his backup. Thompson had several wide receivers to look to in 2006, including Malcolm Kelly, Manuel Johnson, and Juaquin Iglesias. Not to mention junior Adrian Peterson, the team's main running back. Most of the Sooners' experience {{was on the other}} side of the ball. <b>The</b> <b>Sooner</b> linebackers were the most experienced players on the team. The squad was anchored by Rufus Alexander and Zach Latimer. Alexander was ranked as the third best linebacker in the country at the beginning of the season by College Football News. Behind them were other key players such as Demarrio Pleasant and Lewis Baker. Sophomore Ryan Reynolds, a notable player coming out of high school, was injured in the preseason and therefore was unable to contribute in 2006. In addition to a veteran linebacker squad, Oklahoma had a number of big-name defensive ends. During the preseason, College Football News ranked Larry Birdine, Calvin Thibodeaux and C.J. Ah You in the top 25 best defensive ends for the 2006 season (ranked 14th, 20th, and 22nd, respectively). Oklahoma was the only team with three players in the top 25.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating from}} UConn, Stacy {{worked as an}} {{assistant}} coach at her alma mater before reuniting with her old high school coach Sherri Coale at Oklahoma in 2001. Since joining <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> staff <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> have been invited to the NCAA Tournament every season. In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> advanced to <b>the</b> title game in the 2002 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament to play her alma mater. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> lost to UConn 82-70 in Hansmeyer's reunion with Connecticut.She stepped down from her position after the 2011 season.|$|R
50|$|During this streak, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> won <b>the</b> {{national}} championship in 1955 and '56. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> won 14 straight conference titles from 1946 to 1959, one under Jim Tatum and 13 under Wilkinson. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> also went undefeated in conference play from November 23, 1946 to October 31, 1959; their record was only blemished by two ties.|$|R
50|$|Oklahoma's {{loss was}} {{historically}} significant. OU ran the most plays (104) in its history, beating {{the previous record}} of 102. In games in which <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> ran more than 90 plays, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> had been 39-0. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> also had only 29 first downs; OU was 57-0 before the game, in which it made at least 29 first downs.|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooner</b> Schooner {{made its}} first {{appearance}} during a 1964 football game against USC. The Sooners lost that game by 26 points.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> started <b>the</b> {{game with}} the ball, but an early {{interception}} – Bradford's second of the season – led to an early 7–0 Tulsa lead. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> came back {{in the first quarter}} and scored two touchdowns on two big plays: a 29yard run by Allen Patrick and a 46yard pass to Juaquin Iglesias. The second quarter saw <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> widen their lead, even with Tulsa managing to score a touchdown off a 48yard pass from Tulsa quarterback Paul Smith. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> were ahead at halftime 35–14.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ottawa <b>Sooners</b> are a Canadian {{football}} team based in Ottawa. The team {{plays in the}} Ontario Football Conference of the Canadian Junior Football League. The team had achieved success during its play in the CJFL, winning a total of 4 National Championships (1974, 1979, 1984 and 1992). After 35 years of competition (1960-1995) in <b>the</b> CJFL, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> moved to <b>the</b> Quebec Junior Football League {{for the beginning of}} the 1996 season. There, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> would win 3 Manson Cup Championships (1997, 2001 and 2002). <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> rejoined <b>the</b> CJFL {{for the start of the}} 2009 season. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> have a long history in the city of Ottawa, and while playing in the QJFL they had developed a good rivalry with the now defunct Ottawa Junior Riders. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> are now <b>the</b> only junior football club in Ottawa.|$|R
50|$|Cochell {{wasted no}} time {{bringing}} the team back into the national spotlight. In his first year, Cochell led the team to an overall record of 40-23 and a second-place finish in the Big Eight. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> earned a spot in post-season play, but were quickly eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> went 0-2 in the 1991 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, losing their second game to eventual National Champion LSU. The following year, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> tied for <b>the</b> Big Eight conference championship, and once again were awarded with a spot in <b>the</b> post-season. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> fared much better winning the NCAA Mideast Regional to earn their {{first trip to the}} College World Series since 1976. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> tied for 5th in the 1992 College World Series winning 1 game and losing 2, but Cochell would use the 1992 season to catapult <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> to national prominence. The 1992 team finished the season 43-24 overall. After a rebuilding year 1993, Cochell was poised to return the program to glory.|$|R

25|$|The 2010 season {{turned out}} to be much more {{successful}} than the 2009 campaign. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> ended <b>the</b> season with a record of 12-2 and became the Tostito's Fiesta Bowl champions by defeating Connecticut by a score of 48-20 in Glendale, Arizona. This was the first BCS bowl game victory for Bob Stoops and <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> since <b>the</b> 2003 Rose Bowl. Marquee victories for <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> in 2010 were against Florida State, Texas, Oklahoma State and Nebraska. The Bedlam match-up between <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> and Cowboys proved to be the decisive game in who would represent the Big 12 South in the conference championship game. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> defeated <b>the</b> Cowboys in a high scoring affair 47-41. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{went on to win the}} Big 12 Championship game 23-20, the final match between conference rival Nebraska.

50|$|<b>The</b> 2008-09 Oklahoma <b>Sooners</b> women's {{basketball}} team represented the University of Oklahoma in the 2008-09 NCAA Division I basketball season. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> were coached by Sherri Coale. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> are {{a member of}} the Big Twelve Conference and qualified for the Final Four.|$|R
50|$|Oklahoma {{made the}} playoff in the 2015 season, and many experts {{expected}} them to compete for another playoff berth. However, much like Auburn, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> started 1-2, with both losses coming against nationally-ranked opponents. That start ended any hope {{of going back to}} the playoff. In the annual rivalry game against Texas, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> won a close and hard-fought victory over the Longhorns, which started a turnaround and a nine-game win streak for <b>the</b> <b>Sooners.</b> Included in that win streak was a win against Oklahoma State which gave <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> <b>the</b> Big 12 championship and the Sugar Bowl berth.|$|R
25|$|The {{second half}} saw the Wildcats surge — scoring a {{touchdown}} and a two-point conversion on their opening possession to cut <b>the</b> <b>Sooner</b> lead to 28–17. Following an Oklahoma four-and-out, Kansas State again scored but again had the extra point blocked. Oklahoma now led by only five points, 28–23. After not scoring {{during the third}} quarter, Oklahoma managed to score on the opening possession of the fourth quarter. On the ensuing kick off, Kansas State's Brandon Banks caught the ball at the 2-yard line and returned it for a touchdown to again cut <b>the</b> <b>Sooner</b> lead back to five. Oklahoma was able to score what would {{end up being the}} game sealing touchdown on the next possession to give them a 42–30 lead, which they held {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Following the bye week, Oklahoma {{traveled}} to Miami Gardens, Florida to play Miami. This {{was the final}} game in a two-game series that began in 2007 when the Hurricanes visited Norman, where the Sooners soundly defeated them 51-13 after Sam Bradford threw five touchdown passes and <b>the</b> <b>Sooner</b> defense limited them to 139 total yards.|$|E
25|$|Tech {{attempted}} an onside kick {{to start}} off the second half, though the Sooners grabbed the ball at the Tech 34. OU ended the drive on a 33-yard field goal. Tech fumbled on their next possession, Oklahoma's Keenan Clayton recovered the fumble and return it 53yards to the Tech 3. The Sooners added another 7 points to extend their lead to 52–7. Tech cranked up its passing game on its next possession, eventually scoring a touchdown and extra point with 5:39 remaining in the third quarter. On the subsequent drive, the Red Raider defense forced their first sack on Bradford, and also forced the Sooners to punt. <b>The</b> <b>Sooner</b> defense countered in the next drive by forcing a three-and-out. <b>The</b> <b>Sooner</b> offense then added another score on a 66-yard reception by Manuel Johnson. The Tech defense blocked the extra point, and the score remained at 58–14.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Oklahoma had {{its first}} Heisman Trophy winner in halfback Billy Vessels, a local player from Cleveland, Oklahoma.
