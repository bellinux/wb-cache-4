5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the themes lightning, power and storm. The club then {{became known as the}} Melbourne Storm.|$|E

After giving up 128.4 rushing {{yards a game}} in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any, you’d have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said.

5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> her husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna {{took care of her}} mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E

5|$|United {{were denied}} victory by Bayern Munich twice, home and away. In Munich, the home side {{equalised}} with two minutes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> United leading 2–1, after Schmeichel uncharacteristically went for and missed Bixente Lizarazu's throw-in, allowing Giovane Élber to tap {{in from a}} few yards out and score his second of the match.

5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E

5|$|A three-year {{civil war}} {{followed}} his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers {{was created for}} Lothair <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, {{with the death of}} Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) as king.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt was not {{expected}} to make the Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and fourteen strikeouts (<b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in her teens, Regina {{traveled}} to Germany {{to visit her}} brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan {{to go to the}} United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.|$|E

The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E

At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
