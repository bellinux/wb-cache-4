5|$|Restaurant menu: During {{the early}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{expanding}} trade and commerce brought money and {{people to the}} Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> at home, so they ventured out to eat {{at a variety of}} establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling foreigners and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

Moving from position to position, he exposed himself to NVA fire, encouraging the soldiers and treating the wounded.|$|E

2500|$|Besides the copious driving to, from, {{and during}} chases, storm chasing is punctuated with {{contrasting}} periods of long waiting and ceaseless action. Downtime can consist of sitting under sun-baked skies for hours, playing pickup sports, evaluating data, or visiting landmarks whilst awaiting convective initiation. During an inactive pattern, this down time can persist for days. When storms are going {{there is often}} little or no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or relieve oneself and finding fuel can cause frustrating delays and detours. Navigating obstacles such as rivers and areas with inadequate road networks is a paramount concern. Only a handful of chasers decide to chase Dixie Alley, {{an area of the}} Southern United States in which trees and road networks heavily obscure the often large tornadoes. The combination of driving and waiting has been likened to [...] "extreme sitting". A [...] "bust" [...] occurs when storms do not fire, sometimes referred to as [...] "severe clear", when storms fire but are missed, when storms fire but are meager, or when storms fire after dusk.|$|E
2500|$|While {{calculations}} of days, {{months and years}} are based on fixed hours equal to 1/24 of a day, {{the beginning of each}} halachic day is based on the local time of sunset. The end of the Shabbat and other Jewish holidays is based on nightfall (Tzeth haKochabim) which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three-second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7° below the geometric (airless) horizon, somewhat later than civil twilight at 6°. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and sunrise. Most halachic times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into Sha'oth Zemaniyoth or [...] "Halachic hours" [...] by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the [...] "hours" [...] of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for Jewish services, the latest <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> chametz on the day before Passover and many other rules are based on Sha'oth Zemaniyoth. For convenience, the modern day using Sha'oth Zemaniyoth is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00pm, sunrise at 6:00am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, halachic noon may be after 1:00pm in some areas during daylight saving time. Within the Mishnah, however, the numbering of the hours starts with the [...] "first" [...] hour after the start of the day.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} how individuals allocate time and monetary resources to meal production when they change {{the number of}} hours they spend at work.

Similarly, they have higher expenditures on meals outside the home, while allocating less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> out.

Up to two-thirds of the changes in meal production seen at retirement {{can be attributed to the}} pure intensive effect of working less.
