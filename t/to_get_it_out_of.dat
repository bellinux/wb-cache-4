5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{the most}} {{extensive}} restoration took place to the dome during {{the era of the}} Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of the Tawaf, when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba. The water of the well is now pumped to {{the eastern part of the}} mosque, where it was made available in separate locations for men and women.|$|E
500|$|With Annie, it is different. The two of {{them have}} fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then {{a glass of wine}} on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is [...] "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.|$|E

500|$|The {{composition}} and {{setting of the}} scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide. Otto is heard humming [...] "Iron Man" [...] by Black Sabbath. The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote [...] "Like Hell I Can't". The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography Yes, I Can. Homer mistells the story of [...] "Androcles and the Lion", instead referring to it as [...] "Hercules and the Lion". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Burns's line about getting [...] "A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present" [...] is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mailbox, are inspired by the Honeymooners episode [...] "Letter to the Boss".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: [...] "Nothing you will likely {{hear on the}} radio", Rootes explained. The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
500|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{also thought}} that it shares {{similarities}} with [...] "Fighter". She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera sounds as though she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or is this just an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Invading My Mind" [...] {{received}} generally positive acclaim {{from music}} critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes? Well, our bad. The American Idol judge shot up the charts with the cheesetastic Ibiza chant On the Floor. Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or bad, you won't be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots". She continued by stating: [...] "Sure, ' Mind' may be shallower than the kiddie pool, {{but this one is}} up from the first second... and never goes down". Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the [...] "hit potential", while Lopez [...] "brings the heat". She continued by stating that the song is an [...] "irresistible '80s euphoria and release".|$|E
2500|$|A core is {{a device}} used in casting and {{moulding}} processes to produce internal cavities and [...] angles.

2500|$|Then-L.A.

However, local community groups fiercely opposed such alternatives and, in fact, any rail construction that was not completely underground.|$|E

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|Allen told Loveline {{that the}} {{audience}} was [...] "brought to tears {{at the sight of}} a troubled young girl doing something good". At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her system. She played piano to grade 5 standard and achieved Grade 8 in singing. She played violin, guitar and trumpet and was a member of a chamber choir. Her first solo was [...] "In the Bleak Midwinter". She appeared as a lady-in-waiting in the 1998 film Elizabeth, which was co-produced by her mother. She dropped out of school at age fifteen, not wanting to [...] "spend a third of her life preparing to work for the next third of her life, to set herself up with a pension for the next third of her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Mr. Know It All," [...] {{features}} a steady four-four stomp, synthetic strings and drum-machine loops, with Clarkson's vocals being deemed as [...] "raw". It {{talks about a}} deceptive, arrogant man, with Rolling Stone remarking that [...] "Clarkson sasses a controlling man with double-entendres that up her R appeal." [...] The second track, [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)", {{was described as a}} [...] "chilly" [...] electropop and [...] "glitter-disco" [...] song, about encouraging personal reinvention. Clarkson herself compared it to her 2004 hit single [...] "Since U Been Gone". The third, [...] "Dark Side", is a mid-tempo track about a longing to be loved and accepted unconditionally, while [...] "Honestly" [...] longs for the truth, even when it's hard. Clarkson wrote [...] "You Love Me" [...] following an incident that she thought would break her, which she described as the most hurt she has ever been in her life, and while writing about it she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her system. It has Clarkson laying her anger at her emotional abuser’s feet and features heavy guitar in its chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Truth be told, it's quite refreshing {{for an artist}} to embrace their perceived public image, but the joke is really on us. Why? Because it's Cher Lloyd who has the last laugh with another hit on her hands." [...] X. Alexander of Idolator said [...] "Instead of blasting us with that 'Swagger Jagger', she's coming at us with the uber-catchy 'Want U Back' — a good choice, since we haven't been able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our heads since we first heard it." [...] Virgin Media's Matthew Horton wrote that the song has [...] "dynamic catchy bounce." [...] David Griffiths from 4Music praised the track, writing: [...] "It might not sound a million miles away from Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA', but it's got Cher's stamp all over it. From her dead pan delivery ('Please, this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got nothin' on me') to her screams of frustration peppered throughout the track, this {{has the potential to}} be an enormous global hit." [...] Bradley Stern from [...] "MuuMuse" [...] commented: [...] "It is one of the album’s catchiest, cutest moments–even if Lloyd’s gritting her teeth and clenching her fists with rage."

2500|$|Wake and Take - In July 2017, Dan {{decided not}} to do the first [...] "local hour" [...] of the show (9:00 am EST to 10:00 am), leaving Stugotz to his own devices. [...] Mostly because Stugotz is lazy and didn't want to develop his own content, he took phone calls from {{listeners}} (something that Dan steadfastly refuses to do) while the segment's signature music played. [...] This was all done under the guise that, [...] "he had taken plenty of notes and had plenty of information, but {{it was up to}} you, the listener, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him." [...] Stugotz also felt a good use of [...] "Wake and Take" [...] was to interview Mike Ryan. [...] The opening of Wake and Take is known to be masterfully produced; it is a decidedly not-irritating, explosion of audio stimulation that rarely fails to remind the listener of The Ticket's phone-in line number. [...] It is important during [...] "Wake and Take" [...] to give quick, [...] "hot takes" [...] on anything, but any greeting towards the hosts will result in [...] "Suey!" [...] and dropping/hanging up on the call. [...] Dan attempts to fit in (instead of fitting out) during this hour, usually poorly, and has occasionally attempted to get the local hour back to its previous format. These however usually fail, resulting in Dan leaving the studio altogether and Wake and Take resuming.|$|E
