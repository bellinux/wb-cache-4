5|$|Jabara {{returned}} to the United States in July 1953, and was assigned as commander of the 4750th Training Squadron at Yuma Air Force Base (later renamed Vincent AFB), Arizona. By January 1957 Jabara was at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida to join the 3243rd <b>Test</b> <b>Group</b> to test Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. He was first reassigned to Headquarters of the 32d Air Division at Syracuse, New York, then assumed command of the 337th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. In 1958, Jabara flew combat missions over Taiwan in the F-104 Starfighter. From July 1960 to June 1961, he attended and graduated from the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. At Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, Jabara piloted the first supersonic bomber, the Convair B-58 Hustler {{as part of the}} 43d Bomb Wing. Jabara also helped train NATO pilots on the F-104 Starfighter in July 1964, when he was stationed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and he wrote of the aircraft's significant technological improvement over the F-86 Sabre.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Advancements in women’s {{reproductive}} {{technology have}} resulted in women having to face the decision whether to undergo prenatal testing (PNT). This study explored the factors involved in women’s decisions around PNT and assessed {{the extent to which}} the decision making process differed between women that chose not to have PNT and those that chose to have PNT. The Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) was used as the theoretical framework. Study Methods: 30 pregnant or recently pregnant women over the age of 35 participated in semi-structured interviews and completed a brief survey. Content analyses were completed on the interview transcripts, and correlational analyses were performed on the survey data. Results: Women’s personal values, feelings of social support, and perceived competence played major roles in the decision process. Some women in this study indicated the PNT choice gave them a feeling of control and offered feelings of reassurance, while some said having to make the choice was a burden that they found difficult to bear. Women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> appeared to place a great importance on the need for information, while women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> placed greater importance on the need for social support. Each <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> also appeared to differ in facets of their personal values, such as religiosity (only women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> discussed this issue) and need for a sense of control (only women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> discussed this issue). The women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> showed higher levels of uncertainty and decisional conflict, and lower levels of decisional self-efficacy than women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: Each <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> appears to be individual in their needs during PNT decision making. The study findings suggest women should be counseled differently depending on their supports, values, and need for knowledge regarding testing. The findings suggest that women opting against PNT experience elevated decisional distress, and perceive themselves to be less competent and more conflicted over the decision than women choosing PNT. Special attention to these women during the PNT decision may improve their feelings of being socially supported during the decision...|$|R
