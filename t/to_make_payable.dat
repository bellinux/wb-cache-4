His recommendation was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> envujo <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the British administration rather than to African landlords.On the question of the Toro Kingdom, which the British had restored after driving out the Banyoro, Gowers felt that the agreement made at the time was simply a declaration of principle by the protecting power.

60|$|But, {{as all of}} them knew, {{the heat}} of the battle would concern the names which were to be written on the bill. Brisket demanded that the bill should be from the firm. Jones held that as a {{majority}} of the firm were willing that this should be so, Mr. Brown was legally entitled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the bill <b>payable</b> at the bank out of the funds of the house. In this absurd opinion he was supported violently by his wife. Brisket, of course, gave no opinion on the subject. It was not for him to interfere among the partners. All he said was, that the bill of the firm had been promised to him, and that he shouldn't see his way with anything else. Mr. Brown hesitated,--pondering painfully over the deed he was called upon to do. He knew that he was being asked to rob the man he loved;--but he knew also, that if he did not do so, he must go forth from his home. And then, when he might be in want of comfort, the child for whose sake he should do so would turn from him without love or pity.|$|R

"Your uncle, young man," [...] {{said the}} Palmer, [...] "is {{prisoner}}, I should rather say slave, {{to the great}} Soldan, taken in a battle in which he did his duty, though unable to avert {{the defeat of the}} Christians, with which it was concluded. He was made prisoner while covering the retreat, but not until he had slain with his own hand, for his misfortune as it has proved, Hassan Ali, a favourite of the Soldan. The cruel pagan has caused the worthy knight to be loaded with irons heavier than those you wear, and the dungeon to which he is confined would make this seem a palace. The infidel's first resolution was to put the valiant Constable to the most dreadful death which his tormentors could devise. But fame told him that Hugo de Lacy was a man of great power and wealth; and he has demanded a ransom of ten thousand bezants of gold. Your uncle replied that the payment would totally impoverish him, and oblige him to dispose of his whole estates; even then he pleaded, time must be allowed him to convert them into money. The Soldan replied, that it imported little to him whether a hound like the Constable were fat or lean, and that he therefore insisted upon the full amount of the ransom. But he so far relaxed as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>payable</b> in three portions, on condition that, along with the first portion of the price, the nearest of kin and heir of De Lacy must be placed in his hands as a hostage for what remained due. On these conditions he consented your uncle should be put at liberty so soon as you arrive in Palestine with the gold." ...|$|R
