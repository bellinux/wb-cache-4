40|$|The yoga tree, Elaeocarpus joga Merrill (Elaeocarpaceae) is {{endemic to}} Guam and Rota in the Mariana Islands. We have been {{conducting}} {{a survey of}} the pests of E. joga in Guam, and have previously reported on a psylloid and two thrips (Muniappan et al. 2000 a, b). In this paper we report an additional ten pests that attack this tree in Guam, five of which are exotic. We also report on the nat-ural enemies of two of the caterpillar pests. The black citrus aphid, Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) (Homoptera: Aphididae) is found mostly on tender stems of E. joga. It can be found at any time of the year, but we have never found it to be epidemic or to cause appreciable damage. This aphid has been recorded on Annona muricata L., Citrus limon L., Citrus madurensis Lour., and Coffea arabica L. in Guam (Pike et al. 2000). It is widely distributed throughout the tropics. It occasionally transmits <b>tristeza</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus,</b> a virus disease causing leaf mottle (citrus infectious mot-tling virus) on Citrus vulgaris Risso, and little leaf and lemon ribbing virus of lemon. It also transmits two viruses of coffee, blister spot of arabica coffee and ring spot of excelsa coffee (Heinze 1977). A mealybug, Pseudococcus nr. microadonidum Beardsley (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) has been found feeding on the foliage of E. joga. This mealybug was sometimes found in the domatia of yoga leaves. It has been recorded on coconut, banana, and pandanus from Kiribati, Pohnpei, and Marshall Islands. This insect is a new record [JL 1]on yoga and for Guam. As with the citrus aphid, there is little likelihood that this insect is a serious threat to the general health of the yoga tree population.

40|$|Algumas regiões citrícolas, especialmente no continente europeu, ainda não foram, ao que parece, atingidas pela moléstia {{tristeza}} dos citros. Os conhecimentos adquiridos durante as investigações feitas sôbre a moléstia permitem indicar como identificá-la e prevenir suas desastrosas conseqüências nos laranjais. Os sintomas gerais nas plantas afetadas são semelhantes aos causados pela podridão do pé (gomose), podendo-se distinguí-la da tristeza examinando as raízes. Há combinações cavalo-enxêrto tolerantes e não tolerantes ao vírus. É, porisso, muito importante o reconhecimento da espécie cavalo, o que se pode fazer no pomar examinando a sua brotação ou observando o grau de congenialidade entre cavalo e enxerto. O teste colorimétrico feito com a casca da raiz também auxilia o reconhecimento. Os sintomas chamados "pitting" das limas ácidas e pomelos, permitem identificação da tristeza no pomar. O teste de Schneider, Wallace & Dimitan combinado com observações de campo, pode substituir, nas regiões onde a moléstia já foi constatada, os testes de transmissibilidade, mais rigorosos porém demorados, feitos no viveiro ou em estufas. A transmissão por enxertia ou por insetos vetores é feita da planta suspeita para plantas sadias de combinações não tolerantes ao vírus (laranjeira doce sobre azeda) ou para pés francos do limoeiro galego. É de interesse conhecer qual a estirpe do vírus predominante na região, para orientação dos citricultores quanto aos métodos de contrôle da moléstia. A identificação da espécie de afídios predominante na região permite prever a velocidade da disseminação da tristeza, porquanto umas são vetores muito eficientes, outras pouco. O contrôle da tristeza é obtido por métodos indiretos. Nas novas plantações evitam-se as combinações não tolerantes, empregando-se como variedade-cavalo as laranjeiras doces, as tangerineiras, os limoeiros Cravo (Rangpur) e Rugoso. Ãs vezes é possível o emprego de pés francos provenientes dos embriões nucelares. Nas plantações já existentes pode-se fazer a substituição total ou parcelada (individual) das plantas, conforme se constate predominância de afídios muito ou pouco eficientes e de estirpes fortes ou fracas do vírus. A sub-enxertia ("inarching"), a sôbre-enxertia ("topworking") e o afrancamento do enxerto são outras tantas modalidades de controle da tristeza, as quais podem ser vantajosamente empregadas em determinadas condições. Medidas de quarentena podem retardar a invasão das zonas ainda livres da tristeza, -sendo de interesse o esclarecimento do público quanto ao perigo representado pela importação de plantas ou suas partes vivas, exceto as sementes. The <b>tristeza</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> has not {{yet been}} reported from European countries nor from various other citrus growing areas of the world. Investigations on the disease have been carried out in various countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, and United States. Knowledge obtained from these investigations enables citrus experts from areas not invaded by tristeza to recognize its presence in the orchards and to prevent disastrous losses for the industry. General decline symptoms of tristeza resemble those caused by foot rot, but root examination permits the differentiation of the two diseases. Presence of pitting symptoms in trees of West Indian limes or of grapefruits permits easy diagnosis of tristeza in the orchards. Stock-scion combinations may be tolerant or intolerant to tristeza. Thus, it be comes important to determine the rootstock in case of plants showing decline symptoms. This fact can be established by direct examination of sprouts from the rootstock or by observing the degree of congeniality of rootstock and scion. The colorimetric tests made with bark of the rootstock may help to determine it. Field observation of symptoms complemented by Schneider's histological tests may replace the transmission tests for field surveys of the disease in areas where tristeza is already known to be present. Transmission tests are usually carried out by methods of tissue union or by means of the vectors. Young plants of non-tolerant combinations (such as sweet orange on sour orange rootstock) or seedlings of West Indian limes may be used as test plants in these tests. A knowledge of the predominance of the various strains of the tristeza virus complex in the invaded areas is very important in regard to the application of control measures. Also the determination of the aphid vector or vectors in the areas concerned will permit forecasting the rate of spread of tristeza because efficiency varies considerably according to the vector species. Control of tristeza in citrus orchards is obtained by indirect methods. In new plantings made in invaded areas, non-tolerant stock-scion combinations should be avoided. Only tolerant rootstocks such as sweet oranges, mandarins, rangpur lime, and rough lemons should be used for most commercial tops. In some instances {{it may be possible to}} use unbudded trees originated from nucellar embryos. In established orchards, where a non-tolerant rootstock was employed, individual affected trees may be replaced or the whole planting may be interplanted with trees of a tolerant stock-scion combination. The first method is used in areas where the disease is disseminated by a poor vector, whereas the second method is more advisable in areas where spread of the disease is very rapid. Inarching or rooting the scion (by mounding the soil around its base) are used to control tristeza under some conditions. Top working with lemon may also be used. Quarantine barriers may prevent the introduction of tristeza in uninvaded areas. It is highly desirable to inform travellers about the risk represented by the introduction of citrus budwood material or cuttings from areas where the disease is known to be present...|$|E

By comparison, no significant effect of the DNAse was detected for biofilm formation by Xc. DNAse effects on biofilm formation or disruption varied among Xcc strains and Xanthomonas species which suggest different roles for eDNA. Variation in the structure of fibers containing eDNA in biofilms, bacterial cultures, and in twitching motility was also visualized by microscopy.

40|$|Background: Citrus Bacterial Canker (CBC) is a major, highly {{contagious}} <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> plants {{present in}} many countries in Asia, Africa and America, {{but not in the}} Mediterranean area. There are three types <b>of</b> <b>Citrus</b> Bacterial Canker, named A, B, and C that have different genotypes and posses variation in host range within citrus species. The causative agent for type A CBC is Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, while Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii, strain B causes type B CBC and Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii strain C causes CBC type C. The early and accurate identification of those bacteria is essential for the protection <b>of</b> the <b>citrus</b> industry.

The commonly used chlorophyll fluorescence parameters provided the first screening <b>of</b> HLB <b>disease.</b> To further explore the photosynthetic fingerprint of HLB infected leaves, three feature selection methods combined with the supervised classifiers were employed to identify the unique fluorescence signature of HLB and perform the three-class classification (i. e., healthy, HLB infected, and nutrient deficient leaves). Unlike the commonly used fluorescence parameters, this novel data-driven approach by using the combination of the mean fluorescence parameters and image features gave the best classification performance with the accuracy of 97 %, and presented a better interpretation for the spatial heterogeneity of photochemical and non-photochemical components in HLB infected citrus leaves. These results imply the potential of the proposed approach for the citrus HLB disease diagnosis, and also provide a valuable insight for the photosynthetic response to the HLB disease...|$|R
40|$|Huanglongbing (HLB), {{the most}} serious <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus,</b> is {{attributed}} in the United States to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a gram-negative, phloem-restricted α-proteobacterium transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Despite {{the fact that the}} psyllid is well recognized as the vector of CLas, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, little research has so far been conducted on molecular interactions between CLas and the psyllid. Many gram-negative bacterial pathogens have been shown to adhere to insect cell surface by interactions between receptors and ligands, establishing protein complexes that help them enter into insect cells. In the present study, Far-western (protein overlay assay) was used to seek receptors, two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE to explore complexome (receptor-ligand), and MALDI TOF MS/MS to identify the receptors and ligands. We showed how Clas adhered to psyllid cells and which protein complexes were established on the cell membrane.   Understanding how CLas interacts with the insect cells should help in the development of new HLB control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Thiabendazole (TBZ), citral, {{acetaldehyde}} (AA), and Thymus capitatus essential oil-were {{tested for}} their ability to control decay on 'Minneola' tangelo fruit sprayed with a conidial suspension of Penicillium digitatum, either alone, or in combination with a low dose (100 ppm) of TBZ. TBZ at 2000 ppm was used as the standard. Thyme oil, citral and AA, all at 100 ppm (v/v), were applied under reduced pressure (0. 6 bar) and heated to complete vaporisation. Control treatments were performed at normal and reduced pressure. Viability of fungal spores was checked by plating the rinsing water of three fruit per experimental plot on potato-dextrose agar dishes. A colony count was performed daily. All treatments significantly reduced the viability of the pathogen, TBZ at 2000 ppm being the best. The volatile compounds provided better control of the patbogen than TBZ at 100 ppm. Thus, T. capitatus oil, citral and AA could be of great interest in controlling postharvest <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> fruits...|$|R
40|$|Huanglongbing (HLB), {{a devastating}} <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus,</b> {{has become a}} serious problem for the citrus {{industries}} in Brazil and Florida, and both the disease and its psyllid vector, Diaphorina citri continue to spread to other citrus growing regions. Host resistance or tolerance to the pathogen would be extremely valuable to the citrus industry. A field trial was established in Fort Pierce, Florida where HLB has become endemic to assess the HLB tolerance level of different cultivars <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> and citrus relatives. Over 800 seedlings representing over 100 accessions (8 replications of each) belonging to 18 genera of the subfamily Aurantioideae and family Rutaceae were evaluated {{over a period of}} four years. Leaf samples were collected at 6 month intervals during the spring and fall seasons and tested for the presence of HLB associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (LAS) by real time PCR. While most accessions were found to be susceptible to HLB, the bacterium (LAS) was not detectable in about 20 accessions for up to four years of analysis. These include many trifoliates and trifoliate hybrids, some species of Bergera, Casimiroa, Clausena, Eremocitrus, Glycosmis, Microcitrus, Murraya, Naringi, and Zanthoxylum. Information on varietal tolerance <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> and its relatives to HLB is very important for management <b>of</b> the <b>disease.</b>   While most accessions in Citrus were susceptible, partial resistance was observed in some clonal populations <b>of</b> <b>Citrus</b> latipes. The probable basis of resistance is being investigated...|$|R
40|$|Citruses are the worlds’ second fruit crops {{by volume}} next to banana. It {{is one of}} the most {{important}} commodity in tropical Africa as source of foreign currency, raw material for agro-industries and source of employment. The production and productivity <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> in tropical Africa including Ethiopia are critically threatened by a number <b>of</b> <b>diseases.</b> Among others, pseudocercospora leaf and fruit spot <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> caused by a fungus Pseudocercospora angolensis is the most destructive <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus.</b> Literature reviews have been made by searching the available information on leaf and fruit spot <b>of</b> <b>citrus.</b> Journal articles, research papers, workshop proceedings, Thesis research, manuals, and quarantine regulations were among the information sources of the review. The disease is widespread in 22 African countries including Ethiopia with a single report around Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula. Scattered research efforts have been made by different researchers in Africa mainly dealing with its geographic distribution, biology, and management practices. Fungicides, plant extracts/essential oils, and host resistance are among the research efforts made for the control of P. angolensis. Even though the disease is not yet reported to the rest of the world, it becomes a serious concern as an important quarantine pest thereby critically affecting the world trade and germplasm exchange <b>of</b> the <b>citrus</b> industry. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compile the scattered information on various aspects of leaf and fruit spot <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> mainly to avail the information for researchers, development workers and policy people. Moreover, this review will suggest future research and development direction towards better understanding and sustainable management practices <b>of</b> the <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|R
