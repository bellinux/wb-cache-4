A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Church, {{there is}} a {{complete}} review and assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former churches. Before the New Church can be received, <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older churches must be exposed in the open and rejected. This is because <b>the</b> faith <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Church is so opposite to <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older Christian churches that they cannot coexist. An assessment of other beliefs also helps to clarify <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Church, and explains why a revelation was needed to correct <b>the</b> theological direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian churches.|$|R

5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who {{made significant contributions to}} <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity and the Nicene Creed. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen. Since the mid-twentieth century, there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving universal salvation, which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy.

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic.

Known as <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E

Both Post and Beilhart rejected <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> religion but they embraced the view that illness was an illusion and could be overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Bucer's {{efforts to}} reform the church in Wissembourg {{resulted}} in his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church, and {{he was forced to}} flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included Matthew Zell, Wolfgang Capito, and Caspar Hedio. He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, who differed on <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eucharist. Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the Tetrapolitan Confession and the Wittenberg Concord, working closely with Philipp Melanchthon on the latter.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for <b>the</b> <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb {{when she was still}} a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of God, or theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught.

He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The extant folios of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E
5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
