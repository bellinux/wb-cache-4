In order to accomplish this the camshaft is linked to and kept in synchronisation with the crankshaft (the main shaft upon which the pistons act) {{through the use of a}} metal chain, rubber belt, or geartrain.

25|$|Researchers from OPERA {{measured}} the remaining delays and calibrations {{not included in}} the CERN calculation: those shown in Fig.4. The neutrinos were detected in an underground lab, but the common clock from the GPS satellites was visible only above ground level. The clock value noted above-ground had to be transmitted to the underground detector with an 8km fiber cable. The delays associated with this transfer of time had to be accounted for in the calculation. How much the error could vary (the standard deviation of the errors) mattered to the analysis, and had to be calculated for each part of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> separately. Special techniques were used to measure the length of the fiber and its consequent delay, required as part of the overall calculation.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E
25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} of the petrol engine. However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation of refined diesel engines. By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a <b>timing</b> belt or <b>chain</b> to synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears {{to directly}} drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} <b>timing</b> belt or <b>chain</b> instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a <b>timing</b> belt or <b>chain</b> also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when timing belts became the norm, but <b>timing</b> <b>chains</b> have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than timing belts - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, timing belts are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|R

2500|$|One {{critical}} maintenance issue {{specific to}} the Yugo 55 and 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a <b>timing</b> <b>chain)</b> was the need for regular replacement of the interference engine's timing belt— every [...] In a non-interference engine, timing belt failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and poppet valves, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also {{stressed the need for}} 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.|$|E

40|$|Driving and <b>timing</b> <b>chains</b> {{are widely}} used machine {{elements}} which are continuously improved regarding wear and energy efficiency. Especially for <b>timing</b> <b>chains,</b> reducing wear is of high importance as the chain is critical for {{the function of the}} combustion engine. To achieve this goal, the wear within the chain joint has to be measured precisely which is usually done by measuring the length of the entire chain. With this measurement, no information about the distribution of wear between the contacting bodies, pin and bush, is available. An additional measuring and analyzing technique using a standard roundness instrument is developed with which more detailed information about the wear within the chain joint is obtained. With this new method, unworn chain joint components are characterized and the wear on worn components is measured and compared for pins with different surface treatments. Furthermore, approaches to use the measured data in simulation and calculation are presented. Keywords chain drives, wear measurement, roundness measurement, wear calculation...|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the 196 engine, this engine was originally designed by Nash and introduced in the 1941 Nash Ambassador 600 model.

It was a flathead design displacing [...] It was later enlarged to , and finally to [...] It was redesigned as an OHV engine in 1956.

When the engine was changed to an OHV configuration the water pump was moved from {{the left side of the}} engine (driven by a shaft extending from the back of the generator) to the front above the <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> When the flathead model was reintroduced it also received the new water pump. Equipped with such high quality parts as forged crankshafts and connecting rods, these engines earned a reputation for remarkable durability. The flathead, however, was prone to the typical flathead problem of overheating under sustained heavy load. This was from the hot exhaust traveling through the cylinder block to the exhaust manifold.|$|E
2500|$|The CDH {{subsystem}} {{was actively}} redundant, with two parallel data system buses running at all times.

50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (<b>timing</b> <b>chains,</b> belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
2500|$|As {{illustrated}} under production numbers, SM sales declined {{starting in}} 1972. This {{appears to be}} attributable to maintenance issues. [...] Like an exotic Italian car, the Weber carburetors require frequent adjustment. Many engines experienced failure at 60,000km - it was unclear to most owners that the interference engine design has <b>timing</b> <b>chains</b> that require manual adjustment, an issue not corrected until long after production ceased. The 90° engine timing was unfamiliar to mechanics in the 1970s. Only Buick (1962–66; 1975-) and Jeep (1966–71) used a V6 with 90° between banks of cylinders. Another issue that has been resolved with retrofit was unreliable ignition breaker cassettes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|E
50|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was {{hydraulic}} tensioned and had {{a ratchet}} mechanism to keep the chain tight. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> sets.|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{automotive}} industry {{is to achieve}} compact, efficient, reliable systems. Engine timing drives used in engines {{are one of the}} most critical systems. Timing belts are subjected to excessive elongation and wear, while timing gears contribute excess mass and inertia in the system.

Chain drives are easy to assemble and adjust, highly efficient, durable, reliable, compact and capable of attaining a wide range of power and speed capacities. In spite of these advantages their complex dynamic behaviour is not well researched. With the improvement of the speed and load of the automotive engine, and silent chain technology, as silent chain has a compact structure, high transmitting efficiency, high reliability and high wear resistance, its vibration and noise is low, and the silent chain have the advantage of life-long maintenance-free, it significant overcomes the gear drive and belt drive performance, therefore, the silent chain is increasingly widely used in automotive engine timing system.
