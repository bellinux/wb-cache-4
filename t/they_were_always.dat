However, they also discover that their race, the Eldians, are being oppressed and persecuted by the Marleyans, the ruling race that {{with the objective of}} conquering their island, Paradis, and seizing their natural resources, have transformed Eldian prisoners into rogue Titans to keep them trapped inside the walls and sent Zeke, Annie, and the other Titan Shifters to steal the Coordinate. In the occasion, Eren also learns that Zeke is his older half-brother, who betrayed their father and defected to the Marleyans. After Wall Maria is reclaimed, Eren and the others make preparations for their imminent confrontation with the Marleyan forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1652, the English {{parliament}} {{declared that}} Scotland {{was part of}} the Commonwealth. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657. The military administration in Scotland, led by General George Monck, was relatively successful. It managed to enforce law and order, suppressing the banditry of the Moss-troopers and enforcing a form of limited religious toleration, but by introducing English judges largely suspending the Scots law. In 1653–55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton, which was defeated at the Battle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1947–48 season, Harvey was {{called into the}} Victorian team for the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales and made his debut {{alongside}} Merv and Neil, who were already established players. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> out before the next sibling came in to bat. Ray came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{graduated}} from Chorrillos in 1962 with a specialization in engineering. He returned to Panama {{and joined the}} Panama National Guard. Posted to Colón, {{he was given a}} commission as a second lieutenant in September 1962. His commanding officer in Colón was Omar Torrijos, then a Major in the National Guard. Torrijos became a patron and mentor to Noriega, protecting him when he ran into trouble. In a 1962 incident, according to journalist John Dinges, Torrijos helped Noriega avoid legal problems after a prostitute accused Noriega of beating and raping her. Soon after, Noriega's drinking and violence obliged Torrijos to confine him to his quarters for a month. Despite Noriega's problems, Torrijos maintained their relationship, ensuring <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> in the same command; he also brought Díaz Herrera into the same unit. Díaz Herrera and Noriega became both friends and rivals for Torrijos's favor. In 1966, Noriega was again involved in a violent incident, allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl and beating her brother. After this Torrijos transferred Noriega to a remote posting.|$|E

Although No. 11 was not disqualified it failed to compete due to engine problems, suffering repeated failures of the magneto drive followed by failure of the reduction gear housing (similar problems with a Chenu engine also grounded the Martin and Handasyde entry to the competition). No. 10 started the competition but had to be withdrawn with propeller problems.|$|E
25|$|Block I AGC {{memory was}} {{organized}} into 1 kiloword banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was erasable memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit address field. The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the erasable memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected {{the next one}} (bank 2); and 11 selected the Bank register {{that could be used}} to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called fixed-fixed memory, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called fixed-switchable because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.|$|E
