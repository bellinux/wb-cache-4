25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. Imagination {{is not only}} found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.|$|E

GeorgeIV paid almost £6,000 for the sword {{out of his own}} pocket. It remained in personal ownership until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels. A monarch is either girded or presented with the sword as the Archbishop says: [...] "With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> gone to decay, maintain <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> restored, punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order". Afterwards, it is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the abbey in exchange for a token sum of £5, and the sword is borne unsheathed {{for the rest of the}} ceremony.|$|E

[...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ...

Gina Serpe from E!

Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga {{has found a way to}} place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E

[...] Complex in 2012 examined the song through the lens of its inclusion in Can't Hardly Wait (1998), calling it, [...] "one of the most iconic songs of the 90s – those three, unmistakable guitar chords, the two voices trading in verse (one sneering punk, the other, a throaty few octaves lower), and a soaring punk chorus." [...] At Billboard, it is described as a [...] "jump-around pop punk song".|$|E

500|$|Khaled Hosseini {{considers}} pain, love, {{and familial}} {{love to be}} the primary themes of And the Mountains Echoed. The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is [...] "the heart of the book". Both subsequently become [...] "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing — something that safeguards in all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dear to you — or is memory a curse — something that makes you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows."

500|$|Nora Brown (widow of James H. Brown, first {{assistant}} director on The Birds and Marnie, who knew Hitchcock for several years) {{said that her}} husband would not have endorsed The Girls interpretation of events and the film's portrayal of Hitchcock would have saddened him. Gwyneth Hughes interviewed James Brown {{as part of her}} background research for the film, but he died before the film was completed. In October 2012, Nora Brown told The Daily Telegraph that she had written to Hughes expressing her anger. Hughes has said that James H. Brown backed up Hedren's claims of sexual harassment. Tony Lee Moral, author of two books about the making of the Hitchcock films in which Hedren starred, echoed Brown's comments. Writing for Broadcast in December 2012, Moral (who interviewed Jim Brown at length for his 2013 book, The Making of Hitchcock's The Birds) recalled a remark Brown made about Hitchcock. [...] "Some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> expressed about [...] are highly over exaggerated.

500|$|The storyline {{was first}} {{conceived}} when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed {{a documentary about}} homelessness, featuring a mother and child {{at a bus stop}} with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea.

500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
