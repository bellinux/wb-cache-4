5|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} incipit, <b>Tempo</b> marking, voices, time, key and text {{sources for the}} seven movements. The information is given {{for the beginning of}} the movements. Rutter frequently shifts <b>tempo,</b> key and time. The source for the details is the vocal score, unless otherwise noted.|$|E
5|$|The song has a dance <b>tempo</b> and is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of B flat minor with a <b>tempo</b> of 132 beats per minute.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{determining}} which dances are performed, these organizations specify many {{other aspects of}} their competitions, for instance, the <b>tempo</b> of music allowed and the duration of each competition round.|$|E

5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of <b>Tempo,</b> became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} take {{a more active role in}} the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like <b>Tempo.</b> It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a <b>tempo</b> no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly <b>tempo</b> emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{performed}} in the key of B major with a <b>tempo</b> of 70 beats per minute in common time.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{performed}} in the key of B minor with a <b>tempo</b> of 120 beats per minute.|$|E
5|$|Veloz and Yolanda were {{interested}} in the way that animals move and were said to have studied horses to learn change of stride and <b>tempo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, {{the music}} {{begins in the}} key of G major with an Andante Moderato <b>tempo.</b> The verses follow a chord {{progression}} of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino <b>tempo</b> was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.|$|E
5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate <b>tempo</b> indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar <b>tempo</b> interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E
5|$|Avuto i Fiorentini questo fortissimo castello e fornitolo di buone guardie, consigliavano fra loro medesimi fosse da fare. Erano alcuni a' quali pareva sommamente utile e necessario a ridurre lo esercito, e massimamente essendo affaticato per la infermità e per la mala ariae per lungo e difficile campeggiare nel <b>tempo</b> dell'autunno e in luoghi infermi, e vedendo ancora ch'egli era diminuito assai per la licenza conceduta a molti pel capitano di potersi partire: perocchè, nel <b>tempo</b> che eglino erano stati lungamente a quello assedio, molti, o per disagio del campo o per paura d'infermità, avevano domandato e ottenuto licenza da lui (Acciajuoli 1476).|$|E
5|$|Both Axel Rudi Pell (on Diamonds Unlocked) and Hayseed Dixie (on Killer Grass) {{covered the}} song in their {{established}} styles of metal and bluegrass respectively. Richie Havens covered the track on his 2008 album, Nobody Left to Crown, playing the song at a slower <b>tempo</b> to the original.|$|E
5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} <b>tempo</b> on {{the lines of the}} {{previous}} section, making it more difficult for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts. After the moves 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White has tried two different plans.|$|E
5|$|Changes in the <b>tempo</b> or meter indications, {{mainly in}} the opening movements: D.958/I was {{originally}} marked Allegro moderato; D.959/I was originally in alla breve time; D.959/II was originally marked Andante; and D.960/I was originally marked Moderato.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy, {{the fifth}} barcarolle was written after {{a five-year period}} in which Fauré {{composed}} nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It {{is the first of}} Fauré's piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in <b>tempo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hopkins {{controlled}} the deliberate <b>tempo</b> of the game, {{and held a}} 4–2 lead going into halftime. After scoring first after halftime, Hopkins saw Duke pull even with three goals in 45seconds during the third quarter, including back-to-back goals just 7seconds apart.|$|E
5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict <b>tempo</b> and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato <b>tempo,</b> and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Kinský {{became a}} goalkeeping {{coach for the}} youth team of FC <b>Tempo</b> Prague after {{finishing}} his playing career, stating his desire {{to work as a}} goalkeeping coach in professional football in the future, but not as a head coach.|$|E
5|$|Kinský studied Russian at school. He and his wife, Martina, {{have two}} children, Tonda and Andrea, who both {{take part in}} sports. His son played youth {{football}} for FC <b>Tempo</b> Prague in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{also played}} a key role in Victoria's Sheffield Shield triumph, scoring 667 runs for the State in four matches, all of which were won, at an average of 133.40. Miller scored 188 against South Australia, before making 153 and 206 not out, both at high <b>tempo</b> as Victoria twice {{defeated}} arch-rivals New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Office of Strategic Influence {{features}} Moore's signature use of spoke word samples. He collected samples {{first and}} then tried to match them with the song's <b>tempo.</b> Moore said that the samples relate directly to the song's lyrics.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 1915, {{the first}} {{demonstration}} in Belém {{took place at}} the Theatro Politheama. The O <b>Tempo</b> newspaper announced the event, stating that Conde Koma would show the main jiu-jitsu techniques, excepting the prohibited ones. He would also demonstrate self-defense techniques. After that, the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd, and there would be the first sensational match of jiu-jitsu between Shimitsu (champion of Argentina) and Laku (Peruvian military professor). On December 22, 1915, according to O <b>Tempo,</b> jiu-jitsu world champion Maeda, head of the Japanese troupe, and Satake, New York champion, performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu-jitsu match. On the same day, Nagib Assef, an Australian Greco-Roman wrestling champion of Turkish origin, challenged Maeda. On December 24, 1915, Maeda defeated in seconds the boxer Barbadiano Adolpho Corbiniano, who became one of his disciples. On January 3, 1916 at Theatro Politheama, Maeda finally fought Nagib Assef, who was thrown off the stage and pinned into submission by arm-lock. On January 8, 1916, Maeda, Okura, and Shimitsu boarded the SS Antony and left for Liverpool. Tokugoro Ito went to Los Angeles. Satake and Laku stayed in Manaus teaching, according to O <b>Tempo,</b> jiu-jitsu. After 15 years together, Maeda and Satake had finally split up. Of this last trip, little is known. Maeda went from England to Portugal, Spain, and France, coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone. Settling in Belém do Pará, Maeda married D. May Iris.|$|E
5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods. The beginning is recalled {{in the middle and}} at the end. The following table is based on the score and on an analysis by Katherine FitzGibbon. The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The work is in D minor and common time. The <b>tempo</b> marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the most dramatic section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial <b>tempo</b> for the conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Silent Alarm {{garnered}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} with praise often centered on its fast <b>tempo</b> and passionate delivery. Later in 2005, it was remixed as Silent Alarm Remixed and was re-released with bonus tracks {{to coincide with}} Bloc Party's worldwide touring schedule. The album has received accolades throughout the music industry since its release.|$|E
5|$|Soon after launch night, NBN {{extended}} {{television coverage}} from Bungwahl to Broken Bay {{and as far}} west as Aberdeen. The station only operated eight hours per day, however several programs were produced locally including Home at Three, Let's Cook With Gas, <b>Tempo,</b> Focus, as well as nightly news bulletins at 6.30pm.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} country duet is set {{in common}} time with a gentle <b>tempo</b> of 69 beats per minute. The song's vocals range one octave, from C3 to B4. The song is written in a key of B major and features the chord progression, Esus2—B—C7.|$|E
5|$|The five-minute, 40-second gospel {{song was}} written in the key of G major with a <b>tempo</b> of 103 beats per minute. Instrumentation is {{provided}} by piano, organ, vibraphone, glockenspiel, harmonica, and a guitar. The instruments were played by Tribbett, Fair, Paul Jackson, Jr., and Frank Brunot.|$|E
5|$|The {{second is}} the {{circular}} bodied plucked lute, the yueqin. Percussion instruments include the daluo, xiaoluo, and naobo. The player of the gu and ban, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in subtle ways. In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow <b>tempo),</b> yuanban (a standard, medium-fast <b>tempo),</b> kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast <b>tempo).</b> Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The <b>tempo</b> {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a <b>tempo</b> of 173 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from E3 to B4.|$|E
5|$|The song is set {{in common}} time with a ballad <b>tempo</b> of 90 beats per minute. It is written in a key of A major. The group's vocals span three octaves, from F#3 to E5. The song has the {{following}} chord progression, A–F#m–C#m–E5.|$|E
5|$|The unpopularity of the Colonial Wars {{among many}} Portuguese {{led to the}} {{formation}} of several magazines and newspapers, such as Cadernos Circunstância, Cadernos Necessários, <b>Tempo</b> e Modo, and Polémica, which had support from students and called for political solutions to Portugal's colonial problems.|$|E
5|$|Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with American {{tank and}} {{artillery}} support, recaptured Kigye {{and held it}} during the night against North Korean counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn. American air attacks continued at an increased <b>tempo</b> in the Kigye area. South Korean troops reported finding the bodies of many North Koreans, apparently killed by air attack. They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground, abandoned when North Korean soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the <b>tempo</b> of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the <b>tempo</b> of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
