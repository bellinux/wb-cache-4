5|$|The reed is {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> by the ligature, and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth. In the past clarinetists used to wrap a string around <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation of the mouth around <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> and reed is called the embouchure.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece,</b> pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> {{and reed}} are {{surrounded}} by the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece.</b> At this point the reed stays pressed against <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5000|$|Raschèr {{responded to}} this lack of supply by {{engaging}} a manufacturer to make a [...] "Sigurd Raschèr brand" [...] mouthpiece, which was simply a virtual duplication of <b>the</b> <b>mouthpieces</b> that had been readily available from American saxophone manufacturers Buescher, Conn {{and others in the}} 1920s. <b>The</b> Raschèr <b>mouthpiece</b> is still manufactured today.|$|R

5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and <b>The</b> <b>Mouthpiece</b> (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E

25|$|In Cousteau's {{original}} aqualung prototype, {{there was}} no exhaust hose, and the exhaled air exited through a one-way valve at <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece.</b> It worked out of water, but when he tested the aqualung in the river Marne air ed from the regulator {{before it could be}} breathed when <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> was above the regulator. After that, he had the second breathing tube fitted. Even with both tubes fitted, raising <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> above the regulator increases the delivered pressure of gas and lowering <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> reduces delivered pressure and increases breathing resistance. As a result, many aqualung divers, when they were snorkeling on the surface to save air while reaching the dive site, put the loop of hoses under an arm to avoid <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> floating up causing free flow.|$|E

This slightly increases the flow resistance of air, but makes the regulator easier to clear.|$|E

25|$|These unusual {{regulators}} {{were designed}} by Robert J. Dempster and made at his factory in Illinois, USA, from 1961 to 1965. The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both two-stage regulators. The second-stage looks like <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> tube. The exhaled air goes into a corrugated coaxial exhaust hose which surrounds the intermediate-pressure hose and discharges about 60% of {{the way back to}} the first-stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face. Near <b>the</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> is a one-way valve to let outside water into the exhaust hose to avoid free flow if the diaphragm (at the mouth) is below the open end of the exhaust hose. The Mark I has hoses only on one side, and the Mark II has twinned intermediate-pressure hoses, each with its own coaxial exhaust hose and second stage, one assembly on each side of the diver's head, but with both second stages in the same mouthpiece housing and operated by the same diaphragm. This version has no large visible regulator.|$|E
