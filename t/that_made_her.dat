5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E

5|$|After John Firth's death, Arthur {{moved with}} his family to London. According to Richardson they lived in the area around Liverpool Street in the east of the city, {{although}} Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in Bedford Park and then Kensington, both in the west of the city. From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at Studley Agricultural College in Warwickshire, a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> abandon the institution and return to her parental home.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the {{antagonist}} and foil to her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Initially {{identified only}} by her first name, Liz is first {{seen as the}} owner of a resort on the fictional St. Lisa's Island, located near Bermuda and the Bermuda Triangle. Liz is still in love with her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary. Her early appearances center on her attempts to reunite amnesiac Sheridan Crane with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, despite Brian's interest in her. When Liz arrives in Harmony, it is revealed that she is Eve's half-sister, and is later retconned to become her adoptive sister. Liz exposes Eve's past relationship with Julian Crane, inadvertently leading them to reunite and proving Chad Harris-Crane and Whitney Russell were not committing incest by her identification as Chad's mother. Liz harbors a deep desire for revenge against Eve for unknowingly abandoning her in an abusive household. Liz also seeks vengeance against the Crane family after she was raped by Alistair, and later forced to undergo surgery <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> barren. Liz leaves the show in February 2006, abandoning her vengeance against Eve, Julian, and Alistair to find a new life for herself.|$|E
5|$|Pickford {{was born}} Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting {{on stage in}} 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, {{she moved to the}} Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, {{followed}} by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew that}} this was true. She did not attempt to conceal it from herself now. The charm of those rides with her uncle was the chance of seeing Arthur. The sweet, never-wearying charm <b>that</b> <b>made</b> this summer one of perfect happiness, <b>that</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> almost forget her city ways and friends, <b>that</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> brown and strong with the soil and wind, was daily contact with a robust and {{wholesome}} young man, a sturdy figure with brown throat and bare, strong arms.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art {{full-time}} under Kenneth Hayes Miller and Kimon Nicolaides at the Art Students League. Nevelson credited {{an exhibition}} of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{as a catalyst for}} her to study art further. In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike's birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann, who was serving as a guest instructor at the Art Students League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance. She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same fluidity seen in the works of Henri Matisse. Nevelson also created terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.|$|E

25|$|During the American Civil War, Dix was {{appointed}} Superintendent of Army Nurses by the Union Army, beating out Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.

25|$|Evert {{decided that}} 1989 {{was to be}} her final year on tour; she made three finals at the {{beginning}} of the year (taking Graf to three sets in the Virginia Slims of Florida). She pulled out of the clay court season after a few uncharacteristic losses. She also withdrew from the Wimbledon warm-up with an inner-ear infection <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> doubtful for Wimbledon. At the 1989 Wimbledon Championships, Evert lost out in the semifinals to Graf with a scoreline of 2–6, 1–6. The last slam singles event Evert played in was the 1989 US Open; her fourth-round match with Monica Seles was a highlight. It was a well anticipated match because of her loss to Seles on clay in the final of Houston (in the spring). She showed all the characteristics <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a great champion, defeating Seles, 6–0, 6–2. She was flat for her quarterfinal with Zina Garrison and lost by a score of 6–7(1–7), 2–6. She said after the match that it highlighted the reason she was retiring.|$|E

Ondine won the 1954 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. This production also garnered the 1954 Tony awards for Best Director (Lunt) and Best Actress in a Play (Hepburn).|$|E
25|$|The French {{corvette}} Robuste was {{a vessel}} built at Nantes as a slaver <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> first voyage in March 1789. The French navy purchased her in December 1793 and {{she served as}} a 22-gun corvette in the Channel. The British captured her in 1796 and took her into the Royal Navy as HMS Scourge. She captured a number of French privateers, primarily in the West Indies, before the navy sold her in 1802.|$|E
25|$|Bardot then {{appeared}} in four movies <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a star. First up was a musical, Naughty Girl (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl. Directed by Michel Boisrond, it was co-written by Roger Vadim {{and was a}} big hit, the 12th most popular film {{of the year in}} France. It was followed by a comedy, Plucking the Daisy (1956), written by Vadim with the director Marc Allegret, and another success at France. So too was the comedy The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful (1956) with Louis Jourdan.|$|E

Couric would also contribute to 60 Minutes and anchor prime-time news specials for CBS. Couric earned US$15 million per year while at CBS, a salary <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the highest paid journalist in the world, a salary similar to Barbara Walters' at ABC. She made her first broadcast as anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric on September 5, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Arvesen {{initially}} {{began her}} career during her teens as an actress, model,dancer and a classically trained pianist in Norway. After college, {{she made the}} decision to leave Norway to pursue her dream of an acting career in the United States of America where she has appeared in several television shows, commercials and movies. After she stopped working in the various soap operas <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> famous her career aspirations shifted from acting to work modeling for television commercials, print ads and popular magazines. Arvesen went on to launch and create her own production company, The Arvesen Group.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{significant to}} the development of Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
