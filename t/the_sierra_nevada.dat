5|$|The {{route of}} US395 in California is {{split into two}} segments, as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada. The {{southern}} segment crosses the Mojave Desert and Owens Valley and passes east of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> The northern segment also follows <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> and crosses the Modoc Plateau.|$|E

5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock that make up <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, {{as far back as}} 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E

5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b>|$|E
