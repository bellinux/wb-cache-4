5|$|The Impact X Division Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling championship, is owned by Impact Wrestling. It debuted on June 19, 2002, at <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of then-TNA's second weekly pay-per-view (PPV) event.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movement}} of the head at program switch point could sometimes pull <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> up or down, causing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to fold over and start playing {{the back side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> would continue to play, albeit muffled and barely audible. Continued playing would flip <b>the</b> entire <b>tape</b> over, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> would be wound on the reel inside with the backside showing. Many vintage tapes can be found with the back side of <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> facing forward. <b>The</b> program switch point is often the place where <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> would be ingested into the player i.e. [...] "eaten", when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> head moved from program 4, to program 1- its furthest track change movement. While moving upward the head would grab <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> fold it over, and when this fold hit the capstan, it would wrap around the capstan and ingest <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> into <b>the</b> player.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} beep {{test was}} initially available on audio tape format. A problem with <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{was that it}} could stretch over time, or <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and tape player. Digital audio formats replaced <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.|$|R
50|$|Some tapes may {{deteriorate}} {{because of}} a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> or <b>the</b> back coating on the reverse side, if <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was from any of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes the urethane to rise to <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. This problem {{became known as the}} 'sticky-shed syndrome'. One explanation was offered that short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> temporarily restores <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by driving <b>the</b> water molecules from the binder {{so that it can be}} safely copied to another tape or a different format. After baking, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> usually remains in good condition for approximately a month. If <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> re-deteriorates, it may be possible to bake <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> again.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of the episode, {{the cast}} and crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were broken down, {{the cast and}} crew each got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Beer Drinking Championship was an unsanctioned {{professional}} wrestling championship {{owned by}} the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. The championship was introduced on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis pay-per-view (PPV) event. It was active until February 26, 2008 when the title belt was destroyed at <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of the March 6, 2008 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to <b>the</b> <b>taping.</b> In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads, instead of moving across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at almost 90Â° to {{the direction of}} motion as in the quadruplex system, move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> transport mechanism, allowing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
50|$|Tape baking is a {{somewhat}} risky procedure, {{since there is}} a risk of damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from <b>the</b> heat. However, there are some important signs that show when a <b>tape</b> needs baking. <b>The</b> typical symptom is squealing when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> passes <b>the</b> playback head or other fixed parts of a <b>tape</b> player. <b>The</b> squealing is audible directly from <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and also transmitted electronically through the output of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> recorder. Continuous use of a squealing tape risks permanently damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> as oxide is sometimes torn off <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This flaking residue can be seen and can feel gummy while still on <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. There is also a risk of damage to the player. Another symptom is <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> sounding dull and distorted. In a video recording, degradation can be represented by audio-visual dropouts.|$|R
50|$|Tabletop or desk {{dispensers}} {{are frequently}} {{used to hold}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and allow <b>the</b> operator {{to pull off the}} desired amount, tear <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> off, and take <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to <b>the</b> job.|$|R
5|$|In May 1984, Larson {{used most}} of his savings to fly to Los Angeles to {{audition}} for Press Your Luck. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer Bill Carruthers overruled him, a move he said he later regretted. Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1989, her {{situation}} improved {{and she was}} cast {{in the role of}} model Emily Franklin in the short-lived ABC television series Living Dolls, which was shot in New York and was a spin-off of the hit series Who's the Boss?. During <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of Living Dolls, she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. After the cancellation of Living Dolls, she moved to Los Angeles. She went on to have a recurring role on the long-running primetime serial Knots Landing.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} {{that he has}} not been taking his medication correctly. Liz calls Tracy's doctor, Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), who gives her instructions regarding the medication. Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech he is going to read at The Waldorf Astoria. Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after sitting down.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> drive {{reversed}} <b>the</b> {{direction of}} <b>tape</b> motion, moved <b>the</b> read and write heads slightly vertically across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> and continued to write (or read) more data {{until the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was reached. This process could be repeated many times, laying down several track sets on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> media in a serpentine recording mode. The Storage Tek 9840, 9940 and T10000 drives are all serpentine recording drives.|$|R
50|$|With a reel turning at a {{constant}} rate, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> around <b>the</b> hub has a lower linear velocity than <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> outside of the reel, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers must slip past {{each other as they}} approach <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> was coated with a slippery backing material, usually graphite and patented by Bernard Cousino, to ease the continuous slip between <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers. While <b>the</b> design allowed simple, cheap, and mobile players, unlike a two-reel system, it did not permit rewinding of <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Some players offered fast-forward by speeding up the motor while cutting off the audio; but rewinding was never offered, because it was technically impossible.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Spectra T950 <b>tape</b> library stores media <b>tapes</b> in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> library {{bundled in}} trays called TeraPacks. A TeraPack holds ten <b>tapes,</b> which {{increases}} <b>the</b> density of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> storage, which <b>the</b> company claims simplifies the {{loading and unloading}} of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> from <b>the</b> library.|$|R
5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spreeâFiggleif takes a gun, bursts onto <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, The British Invasion, {{defeated}} Team 3D on July 21, 2009, at <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of the July 30, 2009, {{episode of}} TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, in a tables match. Afterwards, NJPW {{released a statement}} announcing {{that they did not}} sanction the defense nor the title change, and as such were not going to recognize the reign. They continued to recognize Team 3D as the current champions and proclaimed that the next title defense would be by Team 3D and would be sanctioned by NJPW. On August 10, 2009, NJPW issued another press release stating that they were now recognizing The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams as the current IWGP Tag Team Champions, making the reign official.|$|E
5|$|Special {{considerations}} {{have been}} given for contestants who were unable to return as champion because of circumstances beyond their control, especially {{when there is a}} considerable time between taping of episodes. This occurred {{for the first time in}} season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to attend <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of the next episode because of illness; as a result, three new contestants appeared on the next episode. Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009. On the episode aired December 21, 2015, the returning champion, Claudia Corriere, could not return as champion because of a job offered in the weeks between tapings, so three new contestants played that day as well. Corriere returned as a co-champion on the January 18, 2016, episode, but was eliminated in a three-way loss.|$|E
5000|$|Stiction {{may also}} {{manifest}} itself on computer tapes (9 track <b>tape</b> etc.). <b>The</b> magnetic surface of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> would be heated against the read head in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> deck, and when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> stopped moving would cool slightly and [...] "glue" [...] onto the read head. This {{could be avoided}} by configuring the software so that <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> could be read continuously.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> {{is totally}} {{enclosed}} {{when not in}} use. Unlike competing formats that have spaces in the cassette for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> loading mechanism to be inserted, thus exposing <b>the</b> delicate magnetic <b>tape</b> surface, VCCs have a retractable sheath that covers such space. The sheath is retracted as a tape is inserted into the machine and only then can <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> cover be raised to fully expose <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{shift left}} and shift right {{operations}} may shift <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> head across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> but when actually building a Turing machine {{it is more}} practical to make <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> slide back and forth under the head instead.|$|R
5|$|The Impact World Tag Team Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world tag team championship {{which is owned by}} the Impact Wrestling promotion. The current champions are Ohio Versus Everything, who are in their first reign both individually and as a team. They defeated The Latin American Xchange on August 20, 2017 in Orlando, Florida during the GFW Impact! tapings. It is primarily contested within Impact's tag team division. It was created and debuted on May 14, 2007 at <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of then-TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!. It was officially introduced worldwide on the May 17, 2007 edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today. Like most professional wrestling championships, the title is won {{as a result of a}} pre-determined match.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along <b>the</b> <b>Taping</b> River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E
5|$|Title reigns are {{determined}} either by professional wrestling matches between wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, or by scripted circumstances. Wrestlers {{are portrayed as}} either villains or heroes as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches for the championship. Title changes that happen on episodes of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, air on television two to nine days from the date the match was taped. Changes that happened on weekly PPV events aired either during a live broadcast or aired on taped delay up to seven days apart. The inaugural champion was A.J. Styles, who defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn, and Psicosis in a Four Way Double Elimination match on June 19, 2002 at <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of TNA's second weekly PPV event, which aired on June 26, 2002. Chris Sabin currently holds {{the record for the}} most reigns, with eight. At 301 days, Austin Aries' first reign is the longest in the title's history. At less than one day, Eric Young's only reign, Rockstar Spud's second reign, and Sabin's sixth reign are the shortest in the title's history.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> passes across <b>the</b> erase head, which wipes any {{existing}} recording from <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{technique}} used in all transverse-scan video <b>tape</b> recorders, <b>the</b> recording heads are mounted {{in a rapidly}} spinning drum which is pressed against <b>the</b> moving <b>tape,</b> so <b>the</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows use of the entire width of <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> storing much more data per inch of <b>tape,</b> compared to <b>the</b> fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded {{along the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> through <b>the</b> capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel, and a cuing track.|$|R
50|$|Cassette tape {{players can}} cause skips when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> being played is worn {{or in some}} other way damaged. Since <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is rolled into a reel, it depends on how <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> runs across <b>the</b> roll as to how the skip affects playback. Indeed, some early artists such as the Beatles {{deliberately}} rearranged <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reels in order to produce loops used in their recordings.|$|R
25|$|Within {{hours of}} Butterfield's testimony, Haig had <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> system removed.|$|E
25|$|The WSTM {{version was}} taped in the {{basement}} of the studios on James Street. The studios were also used for <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of Challenge Bowling, a regional junior bowling show co-hosted by Marty Piraino.|$|E
25|$|One episode {{featured}} staff writer, Chris Langham, (who wrote some {{episodes of}} this show, starting in series 3) guest starring due to Richard Pryor {{being unable to}} make <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> of the episode at the last minute.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} auto-reverse mechanism. As <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts pinch rollers. The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> other side of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> path.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> {{made its}} way into the hands of Vedder, who was working as a gas station {{attendant}} in San Diego, California at the time. He listened to <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. Vedder recorded vocals for three of the songs on <b>the</b> demo <b>tape,</b> one of which was [...] "Once", and mailed <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> back to Seattle. Upon hearing <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> band invited Vedder to come to Seattle and he was asked to join the band.|$|R
50|$|Travan uses {{a linear}} track technology, with data written onto {{individual}} tracks over several successive passes. Fully reading or writing a tape to full capacity may require moving <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from reel to reel many times. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is not {{attached to the}} hubs, but is wrapped and held by friction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is prevented from coming off at the ends using small holes punched in <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> which are detected by optical sensors in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive using a 45-degree mirror inside and {{a window on the}} side the cartridge.|$|R
