5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser of Dublin noted <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> called [...] "one of the most sensational and awful chapters {{in the annals of}} human wickedness" [...] had resulted in the press [...] "teem with descriptions and details of the ghastly horrors of that crime".|$|E
500|$|John Kosik of the Associated Press criticized its price, stating: [...] "For $200, casual fans {{may want}} to steer clear." [...] Kosik also said <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> [...] "offers the hard-core {{listener}} goes beyond the distinct romance of vinyl's warm, earthy sound." [...] Bob Gendron of TONEAudio wrote that the box set was a [...] "godsend" [...] and also {{said that they were}} [...] "amazingly produced LPs that bring to life several of the greatest metal records ever made…" [...] Guitar World praised the box set for its mastering, saying the benefits of the treatment [...] "are immediately clear when you drop the needle onto one of these babies. Basically all the songs Slayer fans lose their mind over are here, sounding heavier, livelier and more brutal than ever." [...] He also said that the remastering made a listener want to thoroughly listen to the music.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{the concept}} of [...] "employeeship" [...] recognizes <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{takes to be a}} good leader is not too {{dissimilar}} to {{what it takes to be}} a good employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results. This approach has been particularly successful in Sweden where the power distance between manager and team is small.|$|E
2500|$|When {{tradition}} {{thus becomes}} master, {{it does so}} {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand.

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{explains}} this unintelligibility with {{a series}} of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be [...] "as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> said was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed {{first for}} Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give {{newspaper}} interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The {{whole question of}} Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last {{the true nature of}} Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [...] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.|$|E
2500|$|... "The way I {{originally}} {{heard about}} (the reunion) was {{from one of}} the guys at Earache (Records), who called me up to ask me about it. I knew nothing about it so I called Martin to ask him about it. The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as <b>that.</b> <b>What</b> <b>it</b> came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left. If you left your employee, you couldn't go and start that business somewhere else under the same name." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{also argues}} that one couldn't {{possibly}} use {{the words of a}} private language. He invites the reader to consider a case in which someone decides that each time she has a particular sensation she will place a sign S in a diary. Wittgenstein points out that in such a case one could have no criteria for the correctness of one's use of S. Again, several examples are considered. One is that perhaps using S involves mentally consulting a table of sensations, to check that one has associated S correctly; but in this case, how could the mental table be checked for its correctness? It is [...] "s if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> said was true", as Wittgenstein puts it. One common interpretation of the argument is that while one may have direct or privileged access to one's current mental states, there is no such infallible access to identifying previous mental states that one had in the past. [...] That is, the only way to check to see if one has applied the symbol S correctly to a certain mental state is to introspect and determine whether the current sensation is identical to the sensation previously associated with S. [...] And while identifying one's current mental state of remembering may be infallible, whether one remembered correctly is not infallible. Thus, for a language to be used at all it must have some public criterion of identity.|$|E
