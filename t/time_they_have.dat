As she is dying, Izzi begs Tom to share what <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> left together, but he is focused on his quest to find a cure for her.|$|E
5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, by which <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls {{until they are}} between 15 and 20years old. The development of these characteristics depends largely on {{the absence of a}} resident male.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E
5|$|Clough {{was born}} on September 24, 1941 in Douglas, Georgia, the {{youngest}} of three children born to Daniel and Bessie (née Johnson) Clough. Clough's parents ran the local ice and coal plant. After electricity spread to south Georgia, {{the family moved to}} Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Clough attended City High School. Clough also met his future wife, Anne Olivia Robinson, during this <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> two children, Eliza and Matthew.|$|E
5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, most of the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five {{times that of the}} general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E

5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand, Dacians have {{a significant role in}} creating a history of an ethnically pure origin for Romanian people. However, at the same <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a much more relegated role in describing Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation, less so than Romans do.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Holloway, London. The club {{was formed in}} Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893. In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier. After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893. In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division {{at the expense of}} local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Since that <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight. The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|Several journalistic {{sites have}} cited its low notoriety {{in the west}} as an effect of Nintendo's {{sporadic}} localization efforts, along with its place in a niche game genre. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> praised the series' gameplay, regularly noting its high difficulty and relationship mechanics. Game Informer and Gamasutra both cited the series as an inspiration for later popular tactical role-playing games, with Gamasutra naming , Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series as being influenced by its design. Destructoid writer Chris Carter, writing in 2014, praised the series' mechanics, {{at the same time}} listing the five best games in the series: among those he chose were Mystery of the Emblem, Path of Radiance, and Awakening. Awakening is generally cited as having brought the series more publicity and player attention.|$|E
