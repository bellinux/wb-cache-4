5|$|Although Scott Riggs won {{the pole}} position, he was {{immediately}} passed by teammate Kahne {{at the start}} of the race. Riggs regained the lap twelve laps later, only to lose it to Tony Raines on the 19th lap. Riggs retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 31 and maintained it for the following sixteen laps, until he was passed by Dale Earnhardt Jr. who led the next 31 laps. Kahne moved back into the first position on lap 96, with Raines moving back into <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on the 123rd lap. Kahne passed Raines to move back into <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> 15 laps later. Johnson moved into <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 168 and held the position for a total of 72 laps. At the race's final restart on lap 307 Johnson led until he was passed two laps later by Kahne who maintained it to win the race. There was a total of ten cautions and 34 lead changes by thirteen different drivers.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Häkkinen moved into <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> of the Drivers' Championship, on 64 points, taking the championship lead {{for the first time in}} the 2000 season. Michael Schumacher lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> of the Drivers' Championship, falling two points behind Häkkinen.

40|$|We {{follow the}} nonequilibrium Green's {{function}} formalism to study time-dependent thermal transport in a linear chain system {{consisting of two}} semi-infinite leads connected together by a coupling that is harmonically modulated in time. The modulation is driven by an external agent that can absorb and emit energy. We determine the energy current flowing out of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> exactly by solving numerically the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered Green's function. The amplitude of the modulated coupling is of the same order as the interparticle coupling within each <b>lead.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> have <b>the</b> same temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> may direct energy to either flow into <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> simultaneously or flow out of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> simultaneously, depending on {{the values of the}} driving frequency and temperature. A special combination of values of the driving frequency and temperature exists wherein no net energy flows into or out of <b>the</b> <b>leads,</b> even for long times. When one of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> is warmer than the other, net energy flows out of <b>the</b> warmer <b>lead.</b> For <b>the</b> cooler <b>lead,</b> however, <b>the</b> direction of the energy current flow depends on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. In addition, we find transient effects to become more pronounced for higher values of the driving frequency. Comment: 10 pages; version 2 accepted for publication in PR...|$|R

50|$|For most {{circuit designs}} {{it can be}} assumed that <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> do not {{contribute}} to the electrical effects of individual components. This assumption begins to break down at higher frequencies and at very small scales. These effects come from the physical construction of <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b> <b>The</b> <b>leads</b> are often metal connections that run {{from the rest of the}} circuit to the materials that each component is made of. This design results in a very small capacitance between the ends of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> where they connect to the device and very small inductances and resistances along each <b>lead.</b> Because <b>the</b> impedance of each component is a function of the frequency of the signals being passed through the device and the inductance and capacitance of <b>the</b> device <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> can cause substantial variation in the properties of components in RF circuits.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonstationary electronic transport in noninteracting nanostructures {{driven by a}} finite bias and time-dependent signals applied at their contacts to <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b> <b>The</b> systems are modelled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian and the transient currents are computed from the non-equilibrium Green-Keldysh formalism. The numerical implementation is not restricted to weak coupling to <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> and does not imply the wide-band limit assumption for the spectral width of <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b> As an application of the method we study in detail the transient behavior and the charge dynamics in single and double quantum dots connected to leads by a step-like potential, but the method allows as well the consideration of non-periodic potentials or short pulses. We show that when the higher energy levels of the isolated system are located within the bias window of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> <b>the</b> transient current approaches the steady state in a non-oscillatory smooth fashion. At moderate coupling to <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> and fixed bias the transient acquires a step-like structure, {{the length of the}} steps increasing with the system size. The number of levels inside a finite bias window can be tuned by a constant gate potential. We find also that the transient behavior depends on the specific way of coupling <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> to <b>the</b> mesoscopic system. Comment: RevTeX, 12 pages, 11 include. eps figure...|$|R
