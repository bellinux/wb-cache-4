5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

You could see the light of the lamp behind the blind, and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> as you came along. And it was here that Jefferson used to sit in the evenings when the shop got empty.|$|E

At Wilson's, Altobelli had complimented Manson lukewarmly on some of his musical recordings that Wilson had been playing.|$|R
60|$|Like no {{bungalow}} in {{the tropics}} was this bungalow of Swithin Hall. Of mission architecture, when they had entered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> unlatched <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> they found decoration and furniture of the same mission style. The floor of the big living-room was covered with the finest Samoan mats. There were couches, window seats, cozy corners, and a billiard table. A sewing table, and a sewing-basket, spilling over with sheer linen in the French embroidery of which stuck a needle, tokened a woman's presence. By <b>screen</b> and veranda <b>the</b> blinding sunshine was subdued to a cool, dim radiance. The sheen of pearl push-buttons caught Grief's eye.|$|R

Rush's/Russell's nickname for Vic was [...] "Gov." [...] Vic's good deed was always looking out to help Hank Gutstop get a job, allowing Hank to pay Vic back (Sade thought little of Hank, {{a constant source of}} friction with Vic).

They name their target Dexter Dupree, {{with a picture of}} Dexter's smirking face on it, and their soccer ball Pencey Military Academy. Also, Batty finds out that Cagney has rabbits, so she, Cagney, and Rosalind visit them in Cagney's apartment.. Yaz comes out from under the couch when Cagney has parsley, as usual, it's the first time Carla's ever come out when strangers are around, because she likes Batty so much. Rosalind and Batty start to visit the rabbits almost every morning. Sometimes Cagney was at his apartment, but usually he wasn't. Batty would always slip a carrot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> and then she must latch the door. If she doesn't, Cagney explains, Yaz will run away, get killed by an animal, and then Carla would die of loneliness, since she and Yaz are best friends.|$|E
5000|$|... "In the 1930's {{few people}} {{could afford a}} car. Rostella and Grace went to Martinsburg by horse and buggy to buy a dresser. Their prize roped down, they started home from a day's adventure. Along toward dusk as they got close to home, a sudden thunder storm came up. Rostella {{was not able to}} control the horse. The runaway ran right up on my family's porch. My father, Harry Luttrell was just able to get the horse stopped as it put its head right <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> Both young ladies were OK and the horse was able to get them home safely. Rostella would later say, [...] "If God had meant for me to have wings while on Earth, he would have given them to me." [...] Gracie loved the ride and in later years she would travel all over the world by airplane. Rostella (Aunt Bea) (Shockey) Mason became Church Treasurer for more than fifty-five years." ...|$|E
50|$|The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow swing {{across to}} Robbins' terrace on giant umbrellas; Penguin enters <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and he gasses Dawn to sleep. As Batman and Robin {{try to stop}} the Penguin, a {{powerful}} magnet the Penguin had positioned just outside is turned on and they are pulled to it because of the metal in their utility belts, immobilizing them. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin had escaped from the magnet by a room service waiter and return to police headquarters. Knowing Penguin is listening in through the umbrella's bug, they announce that the ransom will be paid at Wayne Manor and that Batman and Robin will be waiting inside the armor statues immediately inside in the entrance hall. The Penguin goes to Wayne Manor and returns the actress. He then uses his gas-umbrella to knock out anyone inside the statues. He returns to his hideout to find out that Batman and Robin were waiting there; there had been dummies inside the statues all along. The Penguin is apprehended.|$|E
50|$|Scott Eby {{was later}} charged on five counts {{of first-degree murder}} and one count of predatory sexual assault after DNA {{evidence}} linked him to Riley. By the time the police caught up with Eby to charge him in connection with Riley's murder, he was serving two consecutive seven-year sentences. Eby later confessed to killing Riley after first breaking into another home on the same block as the Foxes'. Eby said he cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> back <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> home and then pushed the door in. He found Riley lying {{on the couch and}} decided to kidnap her when he saw that her father was asleep. He said that he put Riley into his car and drove her to the park where he assaulted her {{on the floor of a}} restroom in the park. Then he killed her by drowning her in a nearby creek within the park. He subsequently pleaded guilty to Riley's murder and received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Scott Eby was on parole and lived only about a mile from the Foxes' home at the time of Riley's murder.|$|R
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose <b>the</b> rusted <b>screen</b> wire on <b>the</b> back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into <b>the</b> side-screened porch <b>through</b> <b>the</b> back <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> She heard <b>the</b> killer coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> kitchen window, so she turned around and ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dining room, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|R
