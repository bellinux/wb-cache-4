40|$|We are {{designing}} a novel telemedicine service, where an experienced endoscopist at a central site can guide endoscopists at remote hospitals during procedures (mainly ERCP). This {{can be done}} simultaneously to several hospitals at once, using several displays in a control room setting. As {{this is a new}} way of working, we design the <b>teleguidance</b> room {{at the same time as}} we learn about user needs. We have conducted field studies and created scenarios to gain knowledge about the usage context and target groups, and we have used mock-ups and high-fidelity prototypes to evaluate the usage situations. The user-centered design activities have helped to articulate user needs, surface technical difficulties, iterate design solutions, create a shared understanding of the telemedicine service within the project team, and prepare for implementation in clinical work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” With {{the spread}} of {{low-cost}} haptic devices, haptic interfaces appear in many areas {{in the field of}} robotics. Recently, haptic devices have been used in the field of mobile robot teleoperation, where mobile robots operate in unknown and dangerous environments performing particular tasks. Haptic feedback is shown to improve operator perception of the environment without, however, improving exploration time. In this paper, we present a haptic interface that is used to teleoperate a mobile robot in exploring polygonal environments. The proposed visuo-haptic interface is found to improve navigation time and operator perception of the remote environment. The human-operator can simultaneously select two different commands, the first one being set as &quot;active &quot; motion command, while the second one is set as a &quot;guarded &quot; motion type of navigation command. The user can feel a haptic equivalent for both types of <b>teleguidance</b> motion commands, and can also observe in real-time the sequential creation of the remote environment map. Comparative evaluation experiments show that the proposed system makes the task of remote navigation of unknown environments easier. I...|$|E
40|$|The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research station {{located at}} the {{geographic}} South Pole, is the most isolated, permanently inhabited human outpost on Earth. Medical care is provided to station personnel by a non-surgeon crew medical officer (CMO). During the winter-over period from February to October, the station is isolated, with no incoming or outgoing flights due to severe weather conditions. In late June, {{four months after the}} station had closed for the austral winter, a 31 year old meteorologist suffered a complete rupture of his patellar tendon while sliding done an embankment. An evacuation was deemed to be too risky to aircrews due to the extreme cold and darkness. A panel of physicians from Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Texas Medical Branch were able to assess the patient remotely via telemedicine and agreed that surgery was the only means to restore mobility and prevent long term disability. The lack of a surgical facility and a trained surgical team were overcome by conversion of the clinic treatment area, and intensive preparation of medical laypersons as surgical assistants. The non-surgeon CMO and CMO assistant at South Pole, were guided through the administration of spinal anesthetic, and the two-hour operative repair by medical consultants at Massachusetts General Hospital. Real-time video of the operative field, directions from the remote consultants and audio communication were provided by videoconferencing equipment, operative cameras, and high bandwidth satellite communications. In real-time, opening incision/exposure, tendon relocation, hemostatsis, and operative closure by the CMO was closely monitored and guided and by the remote consultants. The patient s subsequent physical rehabilitation over the ensuing months of isolation was also monitored remotely via telemedicine. This {{was the first time in}} South Pole s history that remote <b>teleguidance</b> had been used for surgery and represents a model for real-time guidance of CMO s working at remote duty stations...|$|E
40|$|Generally {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAV) {{flight control}} system may be divided into guidance system and stabilization system. Guidance system function lies in guidance commands forming and providing center of mass motion according to built guidance law. Stabilization system function lies in providing of UAV specified attitude or stable angular motion in order to assure a stable center of mass motion along the guidance trajectory. Today the most general guidance systems classification divides them into four main groups: autonomous systems, homing systems, <b>teleguidance</b> systems and combined guidance systems. These groups are separated by the way and place of guidance signal forming. Homing of UAV is such method of UAV guidance, when guidance commands are produced onboard a UAV by means of energy illuminated by the target or reflected from it. Each guidance method possesses its own advantages and disadvantage which must be considered during UAV design subject to its specification requirements. One of such requirements may be providing of specified accuracy under any weather conditions, including wind availability with given wind velocity. That is why wind effect and trajectory features for various methods of self-guidance are investigated in this article. Three guidance methods are chosen for this analysis: direct homing, pursuit-course guidance and proportional guidance. Within the investigation, simplified kinematic equations of motion along the guidance trajectory, allowing for wind, are analyzed. Analytic solutions of these equations are investigated and main trajectory features are compared for three guidance methods above. During trajectory comparison such motion parameters as velocity vector orientation angles ? flight-path angle and course angle, attack angle, cylindrical and rectangular coordinates are considered. Special attention is paid on wind effect on these parameters behavior with application of various homing methods. It is displayed that the greatest trajectory curvature and miss due to wind influence take place on application of direct homing, while on application of proportional homing wind effect is almost absent. To confirm the drawn conclusions, simulation results, obtained by means of described in authors? previous publications model, are presented. ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ?????????, ??????? ????????? ?????. ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ???? ????????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????, ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ????????, ??? ???? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ? ???? ??????? ?????????? ? ????, ???? ?????, ?????????????? ? ????????????? ??????????. ???????? ???????????????? ??????? ????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?? ???????? ????? ????? ????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????, ? ?? ????? ??? ??? ???????????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ???????????. ??? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ??????, ????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ???????...|$|E
