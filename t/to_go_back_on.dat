5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Horsfield {{signed for}} Sheffield United on loan in February 2006, but {{appeared}} {{in just three}} games under manager Neil Warnock in the four-month spell. Both Horsfield and Warnock wanted to terminate the loan prematurely, but West Bromwich Albion had already agreed to sell the player to United {{at the end of}} the season and refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the deal. The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved their differences.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{one of his many}} promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E
50|$|After his spell in Ecuador, {{he decided}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Peru. <b>On</b> February 2, 2011 {{he joined the}} 2010 runners-up León de Huánuco.|$|R

5000|$|... "But {{the best}} one on radio or TV came from Dave Flemming, the Giants’ radio announcer, who said clearly and excitedly on KNBR: [...] "Bonds swings, 2-1 pitch. He drives one <b>to</b> left. <b>Going</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the ball is Hairston. It's gone. Off the facing of the second deck. And Barry Bonds has equaled baseball's all-time home run record: 755 for Bonds." ...|$|R
5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis {{for the rest of}} the run, except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, but he refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of}} the season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E
25|$|The PCB {{expressed}} regret over India's {{decision not}} to participate in the championship. The PCB chairman, Lt. Gen. Tauqir Zia was dismayed over the Indian government's decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their commitment, which was a guarantee that India would have no objection playing multilateral tournaments which included Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith {{decided to}} move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> out <b>on</b> the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of {{photographs}} by Stipe).|$|R
50|$|When Juventus were {{forcibly}} {{relegated to}} Serie B, Kapo returned <b>to</b> Turin, but <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> loan due <b>to</b> {{the abundance of}} midfielders. He signed for Spanish La Liga club Levante, scoring five goals in 32 appearances.|$|R
25|$|The next year, at {{the urging}} of Martin, he auditioned for Rodgers and Hammerstein's new musical in New York. He {{recalled}} that, as he was finding success as a director on television, he was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the stage. Once he read the script, however, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to perform in the project.|$|E
25|$|Benayoun {{moved to}} Liverpool under {{controversial}} circumstances. He had verbally agreed a new four-year deal with West Ham in May 2007, only <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the agreement {{in a bid}} to move to Liverpool. The controversy was heightened on 10 July when the Israeli media reported that Benayoun's agent, Ronen Katsav, had agreed a deal with Liverpool which would mean Benayoun taking a lower pay than the £50,000 a week offered by West Ham in May. On 12 July, Liverpool reported on their official website that the signing of Yossi Benayoun had been completed a £5 million deal with him signing a four-year contract.|$|E
25|$|Pacha {{does not}} {{discover}} Kuzco until he arrives {{back at the}} village. After the shock and surprise at being a talking llama, Kuzco orders Pacha to return him to the capital. Pacha offers, but only if Kuzco would change his mind about Kuzcotopia. Kuzco refuses the offer and sets off on his own, but quickly ends up {{in trouble with the}} local wildlife. Pacha arrives to rescue him, and extends his offer. Kuzco accepts Pacha's help, though secretly plans <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word once he is safe. The two survive many ordeals in the jungle, and Pacha finds Kuzco has a good side to him underneath his ego.|$|E
5000|$|I’m {{so excited}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> out <b>on</b> tour again in 2011! The 'Fearless Tour' {{was so much}} fun and even more unforgettable than I ever imagined, and I can't wait to get back out and play my new music from Speak Now! The fans have been so amazing and I'm thrilled to play in new cities around the world and meet even more of my fans in 2011! ...|$|R
50|$|Priyanke also exited ETV and MCS, before Uoosoof's {{exit and}} the primary reason was that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> concentrating <b>on</b> his core {{business}} and other ventures, including as a technology consultant for another East-West (Nahil) owned enterprise.|$|R

25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
25|$|Despite losing {{almost a}} third of its strength, once Lord Robert's {{operations}} began to succeed, the Boer reaction allowed the 12th Brigade, and the 2nd Wilts, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the offensive against the Boer Republics. Although a part of the Sixth Division, the brigade did not take part in the ill-fated attack on Bloody Sunday during the Battle of Paardeberg. Instead, the Wilts was tasked with guarding Bloemfontein and Kroonstad. Eventually, the 12th Brigade was ordered to move in conjunction with another independent brigade and capture the town of Bethlehem, where Christiaan de Wet's commando was operating from. Although the town was taken, De Wet escaped. Pausing to resupply, Clemments' brigade attempted to destroy De Wet's commando at the Battle of Slabbert's Nek (2324 July 1900). With the Royal Irish Regiment, two companies of the 2nd Wilts conducted a night assault up the Nek, capturing the ridge overlooking the Boer position. Although they cleared the Nek, taking 4000 prisoners, the British forces had not been in time to capture De Wet and some his commando, who managed to escape to the mountains.|$|E
500|$|Henry quickly {{established}} himself as count, building up a network of followers from western Normandy and eastern Brittany, whom historian John Le Patourel has characterised as [...] "Henry's gang". His early supporters included Roger of Mandeville, Richard of Redvers, Richard d'Avranches and Robert Fitzhamon, along with the churchman Roger of Salisbury. Robert attempted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his deal with Henry and re-appropriate the county, but Henry's grip was already sufficiently firm to prevent this. Robert's rule of the Duchy was chaotic, and parts of Henry's lands became almost independent of central control from Rouen.|$|E

She was finally released and allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home <b>on</b> May 9, 1990, and although she was being watched, she was granted a free atmosphere to write. She then wrote My Imprisonment (我的入獄) in which she said, [...] "What I can fight for is to let others know I am innocent but have a rebellious spirit." ...|$|R

500|$|Brynner termed Rodgers' account [...] "very picturesque, but totally inaccurate". He {{recalled}} {{that as an}} established television director (in CBS's Starlight Theatre, for example), he was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the stage. His wife, his agent and Martin finally convinced him to read Hammerstein's working script, and once he did, he {{was fascinated by the}} character of the King and was eager to do the project. In any case, Brynner's fierce, mercurial, dangerous, yet surprisingly sensitive King was an ideal foil for Lawrence's strong-willed, yet vulnerable Anna, and when the two finally came together in [...] "Shall We Dance?", where the King hesitantly touches Anna's waist, the chemistry was palpable.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are behind you, and you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|Riker makes {{a promise}} to Picard never to use the powers again and the ship arrives at Quadra Sigma. A rescue team beams down and discovers a young girl who has died. Riker is tempted to save her, {{but in the end}} he refuses to do so out of respect for his promise; however, he quickly shows signs of regret at this decision, which he expresses to the captain. Tension between Picard and his first officer grows as Riker now seems to be {{embracing}} his powers, and his behavior toward the crew begins to change. At Q's suggestion, and with Picard's blessing, Riker uses his powers to give his friends what he believes they want, turning Wesley into an adult, giving La Forge (LeVar Burton) his sight, and creating a Klingon female companion for Worf. [...] All the recipients reject their gifts, however, with Data (Brent Spiner) even anticipating and declining Riker's attempt to make him human. Picard declares that Q has failed, and when Q attempts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his word, he is forcibly recalled to the Continuum. Picard is pleased to see Q gone, and praises Riker for confirming his trust in his [...] "Number One".|$|E

In town, a stagecoach {{delivers}} the sophisticated Debbie Allen, who has come from Connecticut to find her former sweetheart, Mitch, who it turns out was once a doctor there. She realizes that Mitch is now involved with Frenchie and also that he is suffering from a brain tumor, causing the severe headaches. Debbie decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> East <b>on</b> the next stage.|$|R

[...] Guarding any more of detail of a new second solo album, Gallagher was then asked for a release date of new material, and with hesitation, he said: [...] "It'll probably come out when it's finished, I don't know." ...|$|R

2500|$|An {{attempt to}} cut off the {{retreating}} Union army failed when it encountered Parke's infantry. [...] The casualties totaled around 700 Union and 900 Confederate killed and wounded. Bean's Station marked the end of the fighting in the Knoxville Campaign. Despite being a Confederate victory it had little long-term effect. Longstreet had had a chance to attack an isolated Union detachment, but would have needed significant reinforcements <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> to the offensive. Instead, as the winter set in the fighting in east Tennessee stopped. The next spring Longstreet's men returned to the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|We had an {{idea for}} a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel's family. He gets to Heathrow and then spends about 14 {{frustrating}} hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a terrorist pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist, and when the pilot says, 'We have to fly back to Heathrow' Basil says, 'No, fly us to Spain or I'll shoot you.' He arrives in Spain, is immediately arrested, [...] and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the plane with Sybil.|$|E

60|$|Marguerite {{had promised}} her help and protection, had {{invited her to}} her house, and offered her a munificent gift in aid of a deserving cause. She was too proud <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now <b>on</b> that promise, to rescind the {{contract}} because of an unexplainable fear. With regard to Chauvelin, the matter stood differently: she had made him no direct offer of hospitality: she had agreed to receive in her house the official chaperone of an unprotected girl, {{but she was not}} called upon to show cordiality to her own and her husband's most deadly enemy.|$|R
