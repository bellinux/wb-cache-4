2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} one <b>third</b> of one <b>quarter.</b> Using {{the example of}} a cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a <b>third</b> of a <b>quarter</b> is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one <b>third</b> of a <b>quarter</b> is one twelfth, two <b>thirds</b> of a <b>quarter</b> is two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one <b>quarter,</b> so two <b>thirds</b> of three <b>quarters</b> is three times as large as two <b>thirds</b> of one <b>quarter.</b> Thus two <b>thirds</b> times three <b>quarters</b> is six twelfths.|$|R
