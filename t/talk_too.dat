25|$|During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, {{director}} Mitsuo Fukuda did {{not want}} to <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance.|$|E

Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got in a room, and they were talking about how chicks <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much," [...] "So, we had this war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes. And the song kind of came around from that conversation. I think I make a pretty fair point both in this video and in the song, that dudes are way more annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much about it. I was just gonna stew on it, {{and then do}} it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

500|$|The Harry Potter {{series has}} been criticised for {{supposedly}} supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling {{refused to speak}} out about her religion, stating, [...] "If I <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, {{will be able to}} guess what's coming in the books". However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows. For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross. Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that [...] "my belief and my struggling with religious belief... I think is quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Thale {{writes in}} the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking {{credible}} evidence regarding the bombing, [...] "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants." [...] He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was [...] "partisan," [...] and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, [...] "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset." [...] Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a [...] "notorious" [...] "miscarriage of justice." [...] In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that [...] "he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection... It is the damn fools who <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much and too wildly who are {{most in need of}} protection from the state." [...] Historian Timothy Messer-Kruse revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.|$|E

Bloom revealed on 25 April 2011 {{that he had been}} in contact with Jackson, who had given him a copy of the screenplay and said that there was a high probability that he would return. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I'm going to bet on it... But I can't really <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> much about it because it's still sort of in the ether.

2500|$|One of Alex's doctors {{explains}} the language {{to a colleague}} as [...] "odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of gypsy <b>talk,</b> <b>too.</b> But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. Subliminal penetration." [...] Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. [...] "in-out, in-out" [...] or [...] "the old in-out" [...] means sexual intercourse. Cutter, however, means [...] "money", because [...] "cutter" [...] rhymes with [...] "bread-and-butter"; this is rhyming slang, which {{is intended to be}} impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like appypolly loggy ("apology") seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex's age of 15.|$|E
