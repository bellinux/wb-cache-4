5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Pall Mall was {{constructed}} in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James's Palace. Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times, although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century {{in connection with a}} leper colony at St James's Hospital. When St. James's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park's boundary wall was built along {{the south side of the}} road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The team of restorers {{completed}} {{the first stage}} of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows, from aluminium scaffolding projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved cantilevering a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement {{along the length of the}} building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.|$|E
5|$|In 189 BC, {{the hostages}} taken by Rome, {{excluding}} Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, {{were allowed to}} return to Sparta. Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by and not having access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of Las, which was the home of many exiles {{and a member of the}} Union of free Laconians. The Acheans officially adopted this as the reason to finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. The culprits responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage. The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.|$|E

25|$|The Railways Act 1921 {{led to the}} Big Four {{grouping}} in 1923. All of {{the railways}} of southern England combined to form the Southern Railway (SR), bringing the London Bridge complex under single ownership. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> divided the Chatham and Brighton stations was partially knocked through in 1928 to provide an easier interchange between stations. This allowed a greater range of platforms {{to be used for}} the increasingly frequent suburban rail services to London Bridge.|$|E
25|$|A winning hand {{consists}} of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand they must win by either taking a piece from <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> completes their 14-tile hand (winning from the wall) or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (winning by discard). The winning hand {{is made of}} four melds (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the eyes (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.|$|E

25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero {{at the top}} of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.|$|E
25|$|Most gas {{chambers}} were dismantled {{or destroyed}} as the Soviet troops approached, {{except for those}} at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. The gas chamber at Auschwitz I was amongst those blown up. It was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial, albeit with the entry door and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> originally separated the gas chamber from a washroom removed. The door that had been added when the gas chamber was converted into an air raid shelter was left intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} {{believed that}} for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, {{there were no}} shocks. After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> separated him from the subject. After several times banging {{on the wall and}} complaining about his heart condition, all responses by the learner would cease.|$|E

The Quarantine Wall, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> had been built to separate the local population from patients who were affected by diseases is still visible and has been restored.

During the attack, America Chavez throws the shark across the Shield, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> separates their borders, thus breaking the laws of Emperor Doom and is subsequently arrested by Doom's enforcers, the Thor Corps. Despite appeals from She-Hulk, the baroness of Arcadia, Chavez is sentenced {{to spend the rest}} of her life on the wall. In response, She-Hulk tasks the Sub-Mariners - Namor, Namorita, and Namora - to find the source of the megalodon attack. Meanwhile, Nico Minoru, lamenting the loss of Chavez, comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky.|$|E
25|$|As {{the dispute}} continued, {{the house was}} deteriorating rapidly. Valuable {{interior}} fittings such as chimney-pieces were removed. Lead was stolen from the roof which led to damage of the plasterwork. Roches Stores were reluctant to spend money protecting a building they wanted demolished. The Corporation was partly to blame, as they did not properly replace <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>that</b> they had demolished to facilitate the new road. This left the grounds of Frescati open and no action was taken against {{the people who were}} damaging the building. No repairs were carried out on the house and became derelict. The worsening condition of the house was one of the factors which made its ultimate destruction unavoidable.|$|E
