He remains a {{controversial}} figure in Polish history. Recognized as a great patron {{of the arts and}} sciences and an initiator and firm supporter of progressive reforms, he is also remembered as the last king of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian involvement.

The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is <b>thus</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and <b>thus</b> <b>to</b> reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} {{has been linked to}} sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). <b>Thus,</b> <b>to</b> some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E
