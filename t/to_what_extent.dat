5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} NATO bombing {{campaign against the}} VRS, codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences, artillery and storage facilities initially {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were more responsible for ending the Bosnian War. Also in question was <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> they hampered the VRS.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of the Bosnian War, and <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent,</b> if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E

5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent,</b> if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent,</b> if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{financial}} and temporal investments in embedded systems business is the decision involved in selecting the right components, in particular, the microcontroller. Each microcontroller is made for a particular application. Since, with time, the applications get more complex, the lifespan of existing microcontrollers gets reduced.

5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
