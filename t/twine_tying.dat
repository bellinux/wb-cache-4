5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{wire tying}} balers used 2 wires. It {{was not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square <b>twine</b> <b>tying</b> baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised <b>twine</b> <b>tying</b> hay balers. In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic <b>twine</b> <b>tying</b> pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the combine harvested paddy (variety-Kranti) and wheat (HI- 8498) field. The crop gatherer cum baler was used for collection and baling of crop residues left in the field. Collection and gathering losses were determined for given condition and quantity of straw in the field. Moisture content of loose paddy and wheat straw was 15 % and 8 % respectively. Field operation was conducted at forward speed of 2. 7 km/h and with collecting width of 1240 mm. The number of <b>twine</b> <b>tied</b> bales obtained per h was 181 and 87 with bale density of 200 and 102 kg/m 3 and bale mass of 22 and 10 kg respectively for rice and wheat crop. The collection and gathering losses were 18. 40 % for rice and 41. 12 % for wheat. The cost of producing one <b>twine</b> <b>tied</b> bale was Rs. 2. 75 and Rs. 5. 00 for rice and wheat respectively. At nominal price of rice straw (Rs. 0. 25 /kg) and wheat straw (Rs. 0. 75 /kg) the net income from straw collection and baling using the machine was Rs. 607. 00 per ha and Rs. 235. 00 per ha for rice straw and wheat straw respectively. Straw management in the combine harvested fields by straw collection and baling in the field is considered as an appropriate and economically viable option for timely use of the field for subsequent sowing. 1...|$|R

Farmers were later banned from growing hemp because of its cannabis content.There was also a decline in local production of flax, so the factory had to import both of these raw materials.|$|R
6000|$|Once it {{must have}} been the {{military}} coat of an officer. The cape of it had vanished, but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently. But now the frogs and tassles were gone. In their stead had been patiently stitched (I surmised by some surviving [...] "black mammy") new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine. This twine was frayed and disheveled. It must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors, with tasteless but painstaking devotion, for it followed faithfully the curves of the long-missing frogs. And, to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment, all its buttons were gone save one. The second button from the top alone remained. The coat was fastened by other <b>twine</b> strings <b>tied</b> through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side. There was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues. The lone button was the size of a half-dollar, made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine.|$|R

And the Captain,--how would he have conducted himself in the circumstances? His mother, Emma, the Count, Antoine, Gillie, Susan--every one had a share in his thoughts, as he lay wakeful and watching on the giddy ledge--and Nita, as a great under-current like the sub-glacial rivers, kept flowing continually, and twining herself through all. Mingled with these thoughts {{was the sound of}} avalanches, which ever and anon broke in upon the still night with a muttering like distant thunder, or with a startling roar as masses of ice tottered over the brinks of the cascades, or boulders loosened by the recent rain lost their hold and involved a host of smaller fry in their fall. <b>Twining</b> and <b>tying</b> these thoughts together into a wild entanglement quite in keeping with the place, the youth never for one moment lost the sense of an ever present and imminent danger--he scarce knew what--and the necessity for watchfulness. This feeling culminated when he beheld Nita Horetzki suddenly appear standing close above him on a most dangerous-looking ledge of rock! ...|$|R
6000|$|The youth looked up, and now {{perceived}} {{the advantage of}} the fourth hole or window, just over the forehead, which is peculiar to the Denayrouze helmet, most others having only three openings. He could look up by merely raising his eyes, whereas with the other helmets it is necessary to bend well back {{in order to get the}} front-glass to face upwards. Afterwards he found that there were some who objected to this glass on the ground that as divers when below, and in total or partial darkness, are constantly butting their heads against beams and other portions of wrecks, the upper glass would be in frequent danger of being broken, but to this it was replied that it might be well guarded by powerful cross-bars. The point we believe is still an open question. At all events the upper glass was found useful on the occasion to which we refer, for, looking up through it, our amateur diver saw a stone coming down to him. It was lowered by a piece of <b>twine,</b> and <b>tied</b> to it was an old Times newspaper. Detaching and unfolding it Berrington set his lamp on the sand, and, seating himself beside it, found that he could read with perfect ease! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the mesh opening stiffness of fishing nets {{is an important issue}} in assessing the selectivity of trawls. It appeared that a larger bending rigidity of twines decreases the mesh opening and could reduce the escapement of fish. Nevertheless, netting structure is complex. A netting is made up of braided twines made of polyethylene or polyamide. These <b>twines</b> are <b>tied</b> with non-symmetrical knots. Thus, these assemblies develop contact-friction interactions. Moreover, the netting can be subject to large deformation. In this study, we investigate the responses of netting samples to different types of solicitations. Samples are loaded and unloaded with creep and relaxation stages, with different boundary conditions. Then, two models have been developed: an analytical model and a finite element model. The last one was used to assess, with an inverse identification algorithm, the bending stiffness of twines. In this paper, experimental results and a model for netting structures made up of braided twines are presented. During dry forming of a composite, for example, the matrix is not present or not active, and relative sliding can occur between constitutive fibres. So an accurate modelling of the mechanical behaviour of fibrous material is necessary. This study offers experimental data which could permit to improve current models of contact-friction interactions [4], to validate models for large deformation analysis of fibrous materials [1] on a new experimental case, then to improve the {{evaluation of}} the mesh opening stiffness of a fishing ne...|$|R
40|$|Renardine is a bone tar product {{available}} {{for use as a}} coyote (Canis latrans) repellent in Canada. The substance is applied to pasture borders to prevent coyotes from entering and attacking sheep. Because data regarding the effectiveness of Renardine are lacking, we designed two experiments. In the first, six pairs of coyotes were first presented with 400 g of ground meat in two pans (200 g/pan) with false screen bottoms. Beneath the screens were absorbent tubes wetted with 10 ml of distilled water. Subsequently, during a treatment period, the absorbent tube was wetted with 10 ml of Renardine. Pans were presented for 60 minutes, and the amount of time to consume the meat was recorded. In the second experiment, six additional pairs of coyotes were first presented with 200 g of ground meat inside a barrier created with baling twine and wooden dowels. The area inside the barrier was 1 m 2, and the <b>twine</b> was <b>tied</b> onto the dowels 0. 25 m above the ground. During the treatment period, the twine and dowels were painted with Renardine. In both experiments, all coyote pairs consumed all of the ground meat shortly after presentation. We conclude that Renardine probably is not an effective coyote repellent. However, because the active ingredient in Renardine is bone tar oil and bone tar oil is deer repellent, we speculate that Renardine may have utility as an herbivore repellent...|$|R
50|$|To {{form the}} bale, the {{material}} to be baled, (which is often hay or straw) in the windrow is lifted by tines in the baler's reel. This material is then packed into the bale chamber, which runs the length of {{one side of the}} baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front). A combination plunger and knife move {{back and forth in the}} front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the bale chamber as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the knotters that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber onto the ground or onto a special wagon or collecting sled hooked to the rear of the baler. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and <b>twine</b> to <b>tie</b> it with. The bales emerge with four sides. The twine runs, in two parallel loops, around the wider sides. Of the two narrower sides, there is a cut side and a dull side, and when stacked for storage or transport the bales are normally positioned with the cut side facing outwards.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{research}} has shown that sodium pentobarbital (SP), a euthanasia drug, can persist up to 180 days in equine mortality compost piles. This study attempts to expand upon past research by quantifying SP residues in equine mortality compost piles over a longer duration using innovative sampling schemes. Six, 3. 7 m 2 plots were used to construct separate compost bins with 3 bins serving as control. Each bin was constructed with 1. 2 m high horse panels. The carbonaceous material consisted of wood chips that were added at a depth of 0. 46 m creating the base. Twenty-four whiffle balls, pre-filled with wood chips were placed on the center of each pad. Nylon <b>twine</b> was <b>tied</b> to each ball for retrieval. Six horses requiring euthanasia for health reasons as determined by a licensed veterinarian were used for the study. The veterinarian supplied and humanely euthanized each horse. Each horse was sedated by injecting 8 ml of xylazine intravenously. Each of the three treatment horses were then euthanized by injecting 60 ml of SP intravenously. Each of the three control horses were anesthetized by injecting 15 ml of ketamine hydrochloride intravenously and then euthanized by gunshot to the temporal lobe. Immediately following euthanasia, each carcass was placed on the center of the woodchip pad and surrounded with 0. 6 m of additional wood chips. Serum and liver samples were immediately obtained while whiffle ball, soil and compost samples were obtained over time. Each sample was analyzed for SP residues. Compost pile and ambient temperatures were also recorded. Preliminary data illustrates SP persistence up to 129 days in compost piles with no clear trend of reduction.
