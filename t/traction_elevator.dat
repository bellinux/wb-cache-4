50|$|Finally, in 2007, KONE {{announced}} that they would stop production of hydraulic elevators, replacing them with the EcoSpace MRL elevators, due to the hydraulic elevators' inefficient energy consumption, contamination concerns {{regarding the use of}} hydraulic oil and buried cylinders, and other environmental concerns.

50|$|When {{power is}} lost in a <b>traction</b> <b>elevator</b> system, all {{elevators}} will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group {{will return to the}} lobby floor, open its doors and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby. In order to help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors and shut down.|$|E
50|$|When the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse first opened, it {{provided}} space primarily for just those two operations. The post office occupied {{the first floor}} with the public lobby oriented east to west all along the south wall, and with the workroom {{to the north of}} the lobby. The money registry was located at the east end of the lobby, the stair wrapping around the elevator cage was at the west end. There was a short lobby extension from the stair northward to provide additional postal windows and give access to the postmaster's office at the northwest corner of the floor. A vault was placed at each end of the floor, one for the money registry and one for the postmaster. There was also a single occupancy toilet at each end of the floor. The mailing vestibule occupied the center position of the postal workroom's north wall. Although it was a construction alternate, the lobby was finished with light colored terrazzo with marble divisions and borders at the floor and wall base. The walls had stained wood wainscoting, postal windows, grills, and door casings with painted plaster above. The interior entry vestibule (center door pair only) was constructed of stained wood and glass and had two wood and glass doors. The ceiling of the lobby had ornamental plaster crown mouldings. The main stairway was constructed with grey marble treads and iron railings, stringers and risers. The original <b>traction</b> <b>elevator</b> had a steel grill enclosure and metal hoist way entrance doors with wire glass relights. The postal lobby finishes were duplicated on the second and third floor lobbies (also a construction alternate) except for the ornamental ceiling plaster. Upper lobbies were centered axially on the stair and elevator which allowed a row of offices along the south wall. The courtroom space occupied the north side of the lobby and extended through the third floor. This courtroom was finished modestly with wall coverings, smooth painted plaster, and stained wood mouldings and furnishings. A construction alternate for the courtroom was designed and shown on the bid drawings, but not built. That design was built at the federal courthouse in Pendleton, Oregon, a very similar building that was constructed concurrently. Office areas on the upper two levels typically were finished with wood floors, moulded wood base, chair rail and casings, three panel wood doors, and smooth painted plaster walls and ceilings. The stained wood corridor doors were typically half-light (art glass) over two panels and had transoms.|$|E

50|$|The low {{mechanical}} complexity of hydraulic elevators {{in comparison to}} <b>traction</b> <b>elevators</b> makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.|$|R
40|$|In the {{application}} of vertical transportation systems, a major decision is, which drive system to use, hydraulic or traction? Each type has characteristics which makes it particularly well suited for a specific application. In general, hydraulic elevators are suitable for low-rise buildings (up to 6 floors) whereas, the roped (traction) elevators are best suited to higher buildings. Over {{the last forty years}} hydraulic elevator has been accepted world wide. As the Machine-room-less (MRL) <b>traction</b> <b>elevator</b> system was introduced to replace the hydraulic elevator, strong competition for the low-rise market started. Aggressive market strategies have been applied solely to grasp the market and decline popularity of the hydraulic elevator. These efforts created the MRL trend at the expense of safety. Purchasers however, should be informed about the merits and shortcomings of both elevator systems to ensure the most suitable and safe application of each type. In this paper, mainly hydraulic and MRL traction elevators are discussed and compared in order to enlighten consumers...|$|E

50|$|The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is {{the common}} name {{for a series of}} {{elevator}} attractions at the Disney's Hollywood Studios park in Orlando, the Disney California Adventure Park park in Anaheim, the Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris and the Tokyo DisneySea park in Tokyo. The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved {{through the use of a}} high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most <b>traction</b> <b>elevators,</b> the elevator car and counterweight are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.|$|R
50|$|Critical {{areas of}} the {{building}} have 75 kW emergency power back-up system and 300 kW UPS (uninterrupted power system). In addition, the building has a dual electric power feed from two separate electrical components. A centralized monitoring facility allows video security surveillance throughout the interior and exterior of the building. The communications center has a dual fiber feed from two local fiber communication companies (four separate fiber connections). In addition to dedicated telephone and computer equipment rooms on each floor, there is a 3600 sq ft raised floor computer room with isolated Liebert units for controlled temperature and climatic conditions on the third floor. The building has five <b>traction</b> <b>elevators</b> serving all floors, {{as well as an}} additional hydraulic elevator that provides service between the basement parking area and the first floor.|$|R
5000|$|Some people {{argue that}} {{elevators}} began as simple rope or chain hoists (see <b>Traction</b> <b>elevators</b> below). An elevator {{is essentially a}} platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a [...] "cage", [...] "carriage" [...] or [...] "car") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a [...] "hoistway". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a [...] "traction" [...] elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{elevators}} {{dominated the}} elevator market for 50 years – until {{the beginning of}} the 21 st century. With the emergence of machine-room-less (MRL) <b>traction</b> <b>elevators</b> in 1995, hydraulic elevators began dealing with increased competition. Nevertheless, fluid-driven systems have their distinct advantages, such as low maintenance cost due to wear-free driving com-ponents, flexibility of car and machine-room design, safety features, and easy and cost-effective installations. The room-saving properties of MRLs initially generated increasing numbers of MRL applica-tions. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as a decreasing market for hydraulic elevators, since the fact is that hydraulic control-valve production is increasing yearly. As hydraulic elevators and their advantages become better known in developing countries, the increasing trend to MRLs is expected to level off. The future of elevator systems may become certain as their advantages and genuine costs become public. This article presents statistical information on the actual elevator market trend for low-rise buildings...|$|R
5000|$|Counterweights {{are often}} used in <b>traction</b> lifts (<b>elevators),</b> cranes and funfair rides. In these applications, the {{expected}} load multiplied by the distance that load will be spaced from the central support (called the [...] "tipping point") must be equal to the counterweight's mass times its distance from the tipping point {{in order to prevent}} over-balancing either side. This distance times mass is called the load moment.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{observations}} {{in the past}} earthquake events, the <b>traction</b> <b>elevators</b> in buildings {{are known to be}} vulnerable to earthquake induced ground motions. Among several components of an elevator, the counterweight being heaviest is also known to be more susceptible than others. The inertial effects of the counterweight can overstress the guide rails on which it moves. Here we investigate to use the well-known acceleration feedback-based active and semi-active control methods to reduce stresses in the rails. The only way a control action can be applied to a moving counterweight-rail system is through a mass damper placed in the plane of the counterweight. For this, a part of the counterweight mass can be configured as a mass damper attached to a small actuator for an active scheme or to a magneto-rheological damper for a semi-active scheme. A comprehensive numerical study is conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed configuration of control system. It is observed that the two control schemes are effective in reducing the stress response by about 20 to 25 % and improve the system fragility over a good range of seismic intensities...|$|R
50|$|Elevator: In <b>traction</b> (non-hydraulic) <b>elevators,</b> a heavy {{counterweight}} counterbalances {{the load}} {{of the elevator}} carriage, so the motor lifts much less of the carriage's weight (specifically, the counterweight is {{the weight of the}} carriage plus 40-50% of its rated capacity). The counterweight also increases the ascending acceleration force and decreases the descending acceleration force {{to reduce the amount of}} power needed by the motor. The elevator carriage and the counterweights both have wheel roller guides attached to them to prevent irregular movement and provide a smoother ride for the passengers.|$|R
40|$|Moving slender elastic {{elements}} such as ropes, cables and belts are pivotal components of vertical transportation systems such as <b>traction</b> <b>elevators.</b> Their lengths vary within the host building structure during the elevator operation which results in the change of the mass and stiffness characteristics of the system. The structure of modern high-rise buildings is flexible and when subjected to loads due to strong winds and earthquakes it vibrates at low frequencies. The inertial load induced by the building motion excites the flexible components of the elevator system. The compensating ropes due to their lower tension are particularly affected and undergo large dynamic deformations. The paper focuses on {{the presentation of the}} non-stationary model of a building-compensating rope system and on the analysis to predict its dynamic response. The excitation mechanism is represented by a harmonic process and the results of computer simulations to predict transient resonance response are presented. The analysis of the simulation results leads to recommendations concerning the selection of the weight of the compensation assembly to minimize the effects of an adverse dynamic response of the system. The scenario when the excitation is represented as a narrow-band stochastic process with the state vector governed by stochastic equations is then discussed and the stochastic differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are develope...|$|R
5000|$|Series 1 {{is fairly}} common, and is {{normally}} seen in Otis Elevonic 401 and some hydraulic elevators {{in the early}} 1980s up to the mid-2000s. It has a very distinctive look. Older Series 1 buttons are flush with the panel. It has black plastic trim with either a silver or bronze face plate. The indicator is slanted down towards the floor. Some elevators may also have a slanted up panel with {{some or all of}} the floor buttons on it. There is also flat Series 1, with a flat panel, and no plastic around the edge of the panel. The indicator is green and is often a digital, but sometimes a segment indicator is used for buildings with four floor or less. Two vertical rows of floor buttons are used on hydraulic elevators, and three vertical rows of floor buttons, and the bottom part of the panel slanted forward are used on <b>traction</b> <b>elevators,</b> and also very rarely on hydraulic elevators. This information does not apply for flat Series 1. In the mid 1990s, Otis Series 1 fixtures were redesigned. The buttons now protrude from the panel, analog indicators were completely dropped, the door open/close buttons were made white from green, and the alarm button was made white from yellow. Otis also called these their [...] "Advanced Fixtures".|$|R
50|$|Gearless {{traction}} {{machines are}} low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly {{attached to the}} end of the motor. Gearless <b>traction</b> <b>elevators</b> can reach speeds of up to 4000 ft/min m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering). But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).|$|R

This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} dynamic response of the suspension system employing traditional steel wire ropes as well as ropes constructed of aramid fibers. The equations describing the lateral response of the system subjected to a boundary periodic excitation are solved numerically. The results show that the entire rope is subjected to repetitive low frequency transient resonances. Consequently, the structural integrity of the suspension ropes is compromised.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in simulating {{all aspects of the}} seismic risk problem, from the source mechanism to the propagation of seismic waves to nonlinear time-history analysis of structural response and finally to building damage and repair costs. This study presents a framework for performing truly “end-to-end” simulation. A recent region-wide study of tall steel-frame building response to a M_w 7. 9 scenario earthquake on the southern portion of the San Andreas Fault is extended to consider economic losses. In that study a source mechanism model and a velocity model, in conjunction with a finite-element model of Southern California, were used to calculate ground motions at 636 sites throughout the San Fernando and Los Angeles basins. At each site, time history analyses of a nonlinear deteriorating structural model of an 18 -story steel moment-resisting frame building were performed, using both a pre-Northridge earthquake design (with welds at the moment-resisting connections that are susceptible to fracture) and a modern code (UBC 1997) design. This work uses the simulation results to estimate losses by applying the MDLA (Matlab Damage and Loss Analysis) toolbox, developed to implement the PEER loss-estimation methodology. The toolbox includes damage prediction and repair cost estimation for structural and non-structural components and allows for the computation of the mean and variance of building repair costs conditional on engineering demand parameters (i. e. inter-story drift ratios and peak floor accelerations). Here, it is modified to treat steel-frame high-rises, including aspects such as mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, <b>traction</b> <b>elevators,</b> and the possibility of irreparable structural damage. Contour plots of conditional mean losses are generated for the San Fernando and the Los Angeles basins for the pre-Northridge and modern code designed buildings, allowing for comparison of the economic effects of the updated code for the scenario event. In principle, by simulating multiple seismic events, consistent with the probabilistic seismic hazard for a building site, the same basic approach could be used to quantify the uncertain losses from future earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|In 1857, an {{earthquake}} of magnitude 7. 9 {{occurred on the}} San Andreas fault, starting at Parkfield and rupturing in a southeasterly direction for more than 360 km. Such a unilateral rupture produces significant directivity toward the San Fernando and Los Angeles basins. The strong shaking in the basins due to this earthquake would have had significant long-period content (2 - 8 s), and {{the objective of this}} study is to quantify the impact of such {{an earthquake}} on two 18 -story steel moment frame building models, hypothetically located at 636 sites on a 3. 5 km grid in southern California. End-to-end simulations include modeling the source and rupture of a fault at one end, numerically propagating the seismic waves through the earth structure, simulating the damage to engineered structures and estimating the economic impact at the other end using high-performance computing. In this prototype study, we use an inferred finite source model of the magnitude 7. 9, 2002 Denali fault earthquake in Alaska, and map it onto the San Andreas fault with the rupture originating at Parkfield and propagating southward over a distance of 290 km. Using the spectral element seismic wave propagation code, SPECFEM 3 D, we simulate an 1857 -like earthquake on the San Andreas fault and compute ground motions at the 636 analysis sites. Using the nonlinear structural analysis program, FRAME 3 D, we subsequently analyze 3 -D structural models of an existing tall steel building designed using the 1982 Uniform Building Code (UBC), as well as one designed according to the 1997 UBC, subjected to the computed ground motion at each of these sites. We summarize the performance of these structural models on contour maps of peak interstory drift. We then perform an economic loss analysis for the two buildings at each site, using the Matlab Damage and Loss Analysis (MDLA) toolbox developed to implement the PEER loss-estimation methodology. The toolbox includes damage prediction and repair cost estimation for structural and non-structural components and allows for the computation of the mean and variance of building repair costs conditional on engineering demand parameters (i. e. inter-story drift ratios and peak floor accelerations). Here, we modify it to treat steel-frame high-rises, including aspects such as mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, <b>traction</b> <b>elevators,</b> and the possibility of irreparable structural damage.

40|$|Long moving {{vertical}} {{ropes and}} cables {{are used in}} various engineering systems. In particular, in high-rise structures <b>traction</b> drive <b>elevators</b> they are employed {{as a means of}} car and counterweight suspension and for compensation of tensile forces over the traction sheave. Also, ropes are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the ropes is coupled with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{phenomena}} such as transient and steady-state resonant vibrations in vertical {{transportation systems}} {{deployed in the}} modern built environment and underground mining applications affect {{the performance of the}} entire installation. In extreme high rise structures and deep underground mines <b>traction</b> drive <b>elevator</b> systems and drum-driven lifting installations employ long ropes and cables that exhibit low-frequency modes and nonlinear modal interactions. This results in the need to develop mathematical models in order to simulate their dynamic behaviour to predict and control their non-linear stationary and non-stationary dynamic responses; the coupled vibrations of a car/ conveyance and counterweight; as well as motions of other components present in the system, such as compensating sheave assemblies and diverter pulleys. The underlying causes of these dynamic responses / vibrations are varied. They include low frequency sway motions of the host structure induced by high winds and seismic activities, poorly aligned guide rail joints and guide rail imperfections, eccentric / out-of-balance pulleys and sheaves, systematic resonance in the electronic drive control system, motor torque ripple and aerodynamic effects that occur in the hoistway. Consequently, conditions for external, parametric and autoparametric resonances can readily arise during the operation of such installations. In this context, this paper will demonstrate a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical vertical transportation and lifting installations. Subsequently, dynamic models and simulation techniques for the prediction of their non-stationary / nonlinear dynamic responses are discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. Then, suitable strategies can be proposed to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R
40|$|Modularity {{refers to}} the scheme by which {{interfaces}} shared among components in a given product architecture are standardized and specified to allow for greater reusability and commonality sharing of components among product families.
