40|$|International audienceTo {{meet new}} regulations, {{alternative}} plasticizers to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are now {{commonly used in}} the manufacturing of medical devices. These are: <b>acetyl</b> <b>tri-n-butyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC), bis (2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA), dioctyl terephtalate (DEHT), di-isononylphtalate (DINP), diisononylcyclohexane- 1. 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH) and trioctyltrimellilate (TOTM). An HPLC-UV analysis was previously developed to characterize four of them. However, two compounds were systematically co-eluated: DEHP with DEHA and DEHT with DINP. The first derivative of UV spectra and photodiode array detection allow the quantification of DEHA and DINP. Moreover, for each plasticizer, maximum wavelength absorbance was chosen to be as specific as possible. Quantification ranged from 0. 3 to 750 µg/mL according to the plasticizer. The assays were validated by analysis of variance. Our method was validated by determining the following parameters: specificity, linearity, limits of detection and quantification. The relative biases were inferior to 5 % for ATBC, DEHP, DEHA and DINCH and inferior to 10 % for DEHT, DINP and TOTM. Plasticizers were extracted with tetrahydrofuran and methanol.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to propose a new method using 1 H NMR spectroscopy to determine and quantify these seven plasticizers in PVC sheets, standard infusion tubings, and commercially available medical devices. Two techniques were compared: dissolution in deuterated tetrahydrofuran and extraction by deuterated chloroform. Plasticizer 1 H NMR spectra were very similar in both deuterated solvents; dissolution and extraction provided similar results. The sensitivity of this method enabled us to detect and quantify the presence of minor plasticizers in PVC. In nine commercially available samples, the major plasticizer was identified and quantified by 1 H NMR. In six samples, one, two, or three minor plasticizers were identified and also quantified. DEHP was detected in only one tubing. NMR is therefore very convenient for studying plasticizers contained in medical devices. Only small quantities of solvents and sample are required.

Migration testing was carried out at 40 oC for 10 days (EEC 1993). Determination of the analyte was performed by applying an analytical methodology based on surfactant (Triton X− 114) mediated extraction prior to gas chromatographic-flame ionization detection. PVC cling film used was subjected to ionizing treatment with a [60 Co] source, as well as to electron-beam irradiation at doses equal to 5, 15 and 25 kGy, with an aim to compare the effect of type and dose of radiation on PVC specific migration behaviour. Equilibrium concentrations of <b>acetyl</b> tributyl <b>citrate</b> into the aqueous solvents covered the ranges 173 − 422 μg L- 1 and 296 − 513 μg L- 1 for gamma and electron-irradiated PVC, respectively. Hence, e-beam irradiation resulted in significantly higher ATBC migration amounts compared to gamma treatment. The highest extraction efficiency of the 10 % ethanol solution was common in both gamma and e-beam treatments; distilled water demonstrated the lowest migration. Gamma irradiation at intermediate doses up to 5 kGy produced no statistically significant (p> 0. 05) effect on ATBC migration into all three aqueous simulants; however, this does not apply for high-energy electrons. Both ionizing treatments were similar in that they resulted in statistically significant (p< 0. 05) differences in plasticizer migrating amounts between non-irradiated and irradiated at doses of 15 and 25 kGy samples. Gamma radiation did not affect the kinetics of plasticizer migration. On the contrary, electron-beam radiation produced shorter equilibration times for all food-simulating solvents tested at 40 oC [...] Above values regarding ATBC migration into aqueous food simulants are far below the EU proposed upper limit of specific migration (5 mg kg- 1 ¬) for both types of ionizing radiation.

In vitro release amounts at different intervals were measured by UV-spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Drug contents varied from 96 - 99 %. Thickness and tensile strength varied due to weight variation of the ingredients in the matrix patches. Moisture content and water absorption in wt % were greater for the patches containing higher amount of PVP due to its hydrophilic nature. Variations in drug release were observed among various formulations. It was found that all of the releases followed diffusion controlled zero order kinetics. Two DBP patches yielded better and more adequate release. CONCLUSIONS: The two formulations with DBP were the preferred choice for making matrix patches for further studies...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{potential}} generation via malate/lactate exchange catalyzed by the malate carrier (MleP) of Lactococcus lactis, {{together with}} the generation of a pH gradient via decarboxylation of malate to lactate in the cytoplasm, is a typical example of a secondary proton motive force-generating system, The mleP gene was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in a malolactic fermentation-deficient L. lactis strain. Functional analysis revealed the same properties as observed in membrane vesicles of a malolactic fermentation-positive strain. MleP belongs to a family of secondary transporters in which the citrate carriers from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (CitP) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CitS) ass; found also. CitP, but not CitS, is also involved in membrane potential generation via electrogenic citrate/lactate exchange, MleP, CitP, and CitS were analyzed for their substrate specificity, The 2 -hydroxycarboxylate motif R 1 R 2 COHCOOH, common to the physiological substrates, {{was found to be}} essential for transport although same 2 -oxocarboxylates could be transported to a lesser extent. Clear differences ill substrate specificity among the transporters were observed because of different tolerances toward the R substituents at the C 2 atom, Both MleP and CitP transport a broad range of 2 -hydroxycarboxylates with R substituents ranging in size from two hydrogen atoms (glycolate) to acetyl and methyl groups (citromalate) for MleP and two <b>acetyl</b> groups (<b>citrate)</b> for CitP. CitS was much less tolerant and transported only citrate and at a low rats citromalate. The substrate specificities are discussed {{in the context of the}} physiological function of the transporters...|$|R
40|$|Pervaporation is a membrane-separation {{technique}} {{which uses}} polymeric and/or ceramic membranes. In {{the case of}} pervaporation processes applied to dehydration, the membrane should transport water molecules preferentially. Reactive ionic liquid (RIL) (3 -(1, 3 -diethoxy- 1, 3 -dioxopropan- 2 -yl) - 1 -methyl- 1 H-imidazol- 3 -ium) was used to prepare novel dense cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) based membranes, applying the phase-inversion method. The designed polymer-ionic liquid system contained ionic liquid partially linked to the polymeric structure via the transesterification reaction. The various physicochemical, mechanical, equilibrium and transport properties of CAP-RIL membranes were determined and compared with the properties of CAP membranes modified with plasticizers, i. e., tributyl <b>citrate</b> (TBC) and <b>acetyl</b> tributyl <b>citrate</b> (ATBC). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) testified that CAP-RIL membranes as well as CAP membranes modified with TBC and ATBC are thermally stable up to at least 120 °C. Tensile tests of the membranes revealed improved mechanical properties reflected by reduced brittleness and increased elongation at break achieved for CAP-RIL membranes in contrast to pristine CAP membranes. RIL plasticizes the CAP matrix, and CAP-RIL membranes possess preferable mechanical properties in comparison to membranes with other plasticizers investigated. The incorporation of RIL into CAP membranes tuned the surface properties of the membranes, enhancing their hydrophilic character. Moreover, the addition of RIL into CAP resulted in an excellent improvement of the separation factor, in comparison to pristine CAP membranes, in pervaporation dehydration of propan- 2 -ol. The separation factor β increased from ca. 10 for pristine CAP membrane to ca. 380 for CAP- 16. 7 -RIL membranes contacting an azeotropic composition of water-propan- 2 -ol mixture (i. e., 12 wt % water) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{reported}} previously that {{a substantial}} fraction of the acetyl groups used to synthesize malonyl-CoA in rat heart is derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids. This conclusion {{was based on the}} interpretation of the 13 C-labelling ratio (malonyl-CoA) /(acetyl moiety of citrate) measured in the presence of substrates that label acetyl-CoA in mitochondria only (ratio 1. 0). The goals of the present study were to test, in rat livers perfused with [1 - 13 C]octanoate or [3 - 13 C]octanoate, (i) whether peroxisomal β-oxidation contributes acetyl groups for malonyl-CoA synthesis, and (ii) the degree of labelling homogeneity of acetyl-CoA proxies (<b>acetyl</b> moiety of <b>citrate,</b> acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, malonyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine). Our data show that (i) octanoate undergoes two cycles of peroxisomal β-oxidation in liver, (ii) acetyl groups formed in peroxisomes contribute to malonyl-CoA synthesis, (iii) the labelling of acetyl-CoA proxies is markedly heterogeneous, and (iv) the labelling of C 1 + 2 of β-hydroxybutyrate does not reflect the labelling of acetyl-CoA used in the citric acid cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} 2, 4 -diacetamido- 2, 4, 6 -trideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (BacAc 2) {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} eubacterial pathogens. In Campylobacter jejuni, PglD acetylates the C 4 amino group on UDP- 2 -acetamido- 4 -amino- 2, 4, 6 -trideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (UDP- 4 -amino-sugar) to form UDP-BacAc 2. Sequence analysis predicts PglD {{to be a member of}} the left-handed β helix family of enzymes. However, poor sequence homology between PglD and left-handed β helix enzymes with existing structural data precludes unambiguous identification of the active site. The co-crystal structures of PglD in the presence of <b>citrate,</b> <b>acetyl</b> coenzyme A, or the UDP- 4 -amino-sugar were solved. The biological assembly is a trimer with one active site formed between two protomers. Residues lining the active site were identified, and results from functional assays on alanine mutants suggest His- 125 is critical for catalysis, whereas His- 15 and His- 134 are involved in substrate binding. These results are discussed in the context of implications for proteins homologous to PglD in other pathogens...|$|R
