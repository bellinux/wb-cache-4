5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards down <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E

Of note, was the first Finnish-Canadian newspaper Työkansa (The Working People), which was published by the Finnish Publishing Company. Between 1910 and 1914, the basement of the hall also housed several co-operative restaurants and a billiards room.|$|E

Passenger cars grew along with them, first getting longer {{with the addition of}} a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored a single pair of doors at one end of the car in the car's vestibule; compartmentized cars on American railroads featured a long hallway with doors from <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> compartments.|$|E
25|$|The Hetton Silver Band Hall {{opened in}} 2013, and {{features}} displays reflecting the role colliery bands played in mining life. Built in 1912, it was relocated {{from its original}} location in South Market Street, Hetton-le-Hole, where it {{was used by the}} Hetton Silver Band, founded in 1887. They built the hall using prize money from a music competition, and the band decided to donate <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum after they merged with Broughtons Brass Band of South Hetton (to form the Durham Miners' Association Brass Band). It {{is believed to be the}} only purpose built band hall in the region. The structure consists of the main hall, plus a small kitchen to the rear; as part of the museum it is still used for performances.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Winthrop Rutherfurd {{commissioned}} Grand Central Station architect Whitney Warren {{to design}} Rutherfurd Hall. Completed in 1906, the Hall {{served as a}} hunting lodge family residence where prominent guests could be entertained, most famously U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt who {{was a close friend}} of Winthrop's second wife Lucy. The Rutherfurd family gave <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church in 1959 after the completion of Interstate 80 brought more traffic and noise to the area. The Church changed the Hall's name to Villa Madonna and used it as a convent for an order of nuns for five decades before selling it the town {{to be used as a}} museum and community education facility. Now on the National Historic Register, Rutherfurd Hall first opened to the public in 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{house has}} a classic Beaux-Arts plan, with the major public rooms on its ground floor – the central Elliptical Hall, Dining Room, and Living Room – all in one line, {{parallel}} to the Hudson River. North and South Foyers provide transitional space from <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dining Room and Living Room. Five secondary spaces are located off the Elliptical Hall: the Lobby, Den, Gold Room, Grand Stair Hall, and Lavatory. The second floor rooms, comprising Mrs. Vanderbilt's suite of Bedroom, Boudoir and Bathroom (designed by Ogden Codman), Mr. Vanderbilt's Bedroom and Bathroom, Guest Bedrooms and Baths and the Linen Room, are disposed around the Second Floor Hall and the North and South Foyers. The third floor contains five additional guest bedrooms, and a Servants' Hall separated from the guests' rooms by a door at the main staircase. Supported by both concrete and steel, the Vanderbilt mansion was considered modern for its time. The mansion also included plumbing and forced hot air central heating and electric lighting which was powered by a hydroelectric plant built on the estate on the Crumb Elbow stream. The Vanderbilt estate had electric lighting before the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|John Macbride became both {{principal}} of Magdalen Hall and Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic in 1813, {{and plans to}} move <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site of Hertford College were already afoot. On 15 March 1815, Magdalen College submitted a proposal for the move to Convocation. Magdalen College proposed to repair the Hertford buildings and defray the expense of Magdalen Hall's move to the site, while the Hall were to relinquish claim to their own buildings to Magdalen College. An Act of Parliament was passed supporting the plan, but no move was made until a fire accidentally started by an undergraduate on 9 January 1820 destroyed almost half of Magdalen Hall's buildings. Not long after this, one of Hertford College's buildings on Catte Street, so flimsy that it {{was known as the}} 'paper building', collapsed. With this motivation, the new foundation stone of Magdalen Hall was laid at the new site on 3 May 1820, and the Hall's migration was complete by 1822. The Catte Street frontage was pulled down and rebuilt, and several buildings had an extra storey added to them. Magdalen Hall expanded to fill the space, and became the largest hall by far, numbering 214 members in 1846. Macbride and his vice-principals were active in building up the refounded Magdalen Hall. To distance the Hall from its namesake college, Macbride attempted to change the name to 'Magdalene Hall', but this change was never accepted. Macbride served as principal for 54 years, until his death in 1868. The Macbride Sermon, one of the University Sermons, is preached each Hilary term in the Chapel of Hertford College in his memory.|$|E

This throne is used during {{the main part of}} the coronation ceremony, where the King is presented with the various objects, which make up the Royal Regalia. The king will crown himself, then be ceremonially presented with the objects of the regalia by the Royal Brahmins. These include: the Great Crown of Victory, the Sword of Victory, the Royal Staff, the Royal Flywisk, the Royal Fan and the Royal Slippers.|$|E

Connected to this diminishing reliance on the official government procedures described in the Ritsuryō code was the establishment of a personal secretariat to the emperor, the Chamberlain's Office or [...] This office, which increasingly took over the role of coordinating the work of government organs, was set up in the , <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west of the Shishinden.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Braidwood {{and his men}} had arrived on the scene, the House of Lords had been destroyed. A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow {{corridors}} into St Stephen's Chapel. Shortly after his arrival {{the roof of the}} chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was so loud that the watching crowds thought there had been a Gunpowder Plot-style explosion. According to The Manchester Guardian, [...] "By half-past seven o'clock the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect." [...] Braidwood saw {{it was too late to}} save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> already burning Speaker's House, and then soak the hall's roof to prevent it catching fire. In doing so he saved the medieval structure at the expense of those parts of the complex already ablaze.|$|E

Sir Eubule Thelwall, principal from 1621 to 1630, built the lodgings at his own expense, to include (in the words of the antiquarian Anthony Wood) [...] "a very fair dining-room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven". Tyack said that [...] "the carved wooden panelling of the main rooms [...] a new standard of luxury for the heads of colleges". Pevsner commented that the panelling, set in three tiers with ovals placed vertically rather than horizontally, [...] "looks both dignified and splendid". In 1637, the lodgings were considerably changed with the installation of five [...] "studyes". The shell-hood over the doorway (which Pevsner and Casson both called [...] "beautiful") was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700. It is elaborately carved on the inside with a decorated cartouche and a cherub-head. Casson called it the college's [...] "most engaging" [...] feature. The original gables over the front of the lodgings were removed and replaced with battlements between 1733 and 1740.|$|E
