25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of brain death {{needs to be}} rigorous, {{in order to be}} certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general they require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK), and may include two isoelectric (flat-line) EEGs 24hours apart (less in other countries where it is accepted that if the cause of the dysfunction is a clear physical trauma {{there is no need to}} wait <b>that</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> establish irreversibility). The patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on EEG criteria.|$|E
25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin, being copper-based pigments, require large {{quantities}} of copper {{in order to be}} manufactured. As turacos are primarily arboreal species, they are able to accumulate copper through a diet rich in fruits, flowers, buds, and other plant matter. Church and Moreau estimated that 3 months' worth of fruit intake contribute to producing the pigment present in the newly grown plumage of the turaco species T. corythaix (the Knysna turaco). It has also been observed that it takes young turacos around a year to acquire their colorful adult plumage, and some authors have speculated that they probably need <b>that</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> acquire the necessary copper. It has also been noted that turacos all live across Central Africa, which corresponds geographically with one of the world's richest copperbelts. It is unknown whether turaco diets are especially rich in copper as compared to the diets of other birds, or whether turacos are especially effective at extracting copper from their foods. It is also unknown whether turaco species lacking turacin and turacoverdin-induced pigmentation have a comparatively copper-deficient diet, absorb less copper from their diet, or lack the enzymes required to synthesize the pigments.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{was already}} an {{accomplished}} frontiersman, horseman and guerrilla fighter. In {{addition to his}} native Dutch he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion {{for the first time}} when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions he was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly-killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less." [...] The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait <b>that</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> start hunting again.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{hours before}} Clarke's death a massive gamma-ray burst (GRB) reached Earth.

It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago (roughly equal to half the time since the Big Bang), taking the light <b>that</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> reach Earth.

60|$|As the {{approach}} of Savonarola was discerned, none dared conspicuously to break the stillness by a sound which would rise above the solemn tramp of footsteps and the faint sweep of garments; nevertheless his ear, {{as well as other}} ears, caught a mingled sound of slow hissing <b>that</b> <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> be curses, and murmurs <b>that</b> <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> be blessings. Perhaps it was the sense that the hissing predominated which made two or three of his disciples in the foreground of the crowd, at the meeting of the roads, fall on their knees as if something divine were passing. The movement of silent homage spread: it went along the sides of the streets like a subtle shock, leaving some unmoved, while it made the most bend the knee and bow the head. But the hatred, too, gathered a more intense expression; and as Savonarola passed up the Por' Santa Maria, Romola could see that some one at an upper window spat upon him.|$|R

60|$|Now it isn't {{quite the}} same, I admit, with the {{carbonaceous}} food of plants. Carbonic acid isn't quite so universally distributed as oxygen, nor can every plant always {{get as much}} as it wants of it. I shall show by-and-by that a real struggle for food takes place between plants, exactly as it takes place between animals; and that certain plants, like Oliver Twist in the workhouse, never practically get enough to eat. Still, carbonic acid is present in very large quantities in the air in most situations, and is freely brought by the wind to all the open spaces which alone man uses for his crops and his gardening. The most important element in the food of plants is thus in effect almost everywhere available, especially {{from the point of view}} of the mere practical everyday human agriculturist. The wind that bloweth where it listeth brings fresh supplies of carbon on its wings with every breeze to the mouths and throats of the greedy and eager plants <b>that</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> absorb it.|$|E
