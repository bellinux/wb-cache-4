As of August 2011 the database lists more than 3100 active charging locations in Europe.

50|$|Most {{electric}} cars have used conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging after the California Air Resources Board {{settled on the}} SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001. In Europe, the ACEA has {{decided to use the}} Type 2 connector from the range of IEC_62196 plug types for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for <b>three-phase</b> <b>charging.</b>|$|R
50|$|The EV Plug Alliance had {{proposed}} two connectors with shutters. The Type 3A {{is derived from}} the Scame charging connectors adding the IEC 62196 pins which is suited for single-phase charging - the connector builds on the experience with the Scame connector for charging of light vehicles (electric motorcycles and scooters). The additional Type 3C adds additional 2 pins for <b>three-phase</b> <b>charging</b> for usage at fast charge stations. Based on its origin the connector is sometimes referred to as the Scame Type 3 connector.|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes two novel topologies for {{integrated}} {{battery charging}} of electric vehicles (EVs). The integration is functional and manifests through re-utilization of existing propulsion drivetrain components, primarily a six-phase inverter and a six-phase machine, {{to serve as}} components of a fast (<b>three-phase)</b> <b>charging</b> system. An important feature of the proposed charging systems {{is that they are}} with direct grid connection, thus non-isolated from the mains. Torque is not produced in machines during the charging process. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the novel systems, together with an existing topology. Various aspects of the considered chargers are detailed and elaborated, including current balancing, interleaving modulation strategy, and influence of rotor field pulsation on control and overall performance. A control strategy is proposed and the theory and control scheme are verified by experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the charging of multiple plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) {{in an apartment}} building, equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system. Different charging strategies and charging power ratings are examined, which are assessed {{in terms of their}} grid impact, the self-consumption of local electricity generation, and the electric driving range. The impact of a residential building, which incorporates electric vehicle (EV) charging, on the distribution grid can be significantly reduced by using simple EV charging strategies. These strategies include complementing night-time with day-time charging, peak shaving at vehicle level, and charging the surplus of local generation. Effective results are obtained using only the knowledge of the present battery state of charge, next departure time, and the instantaneous local generation surplus. The simultaneity of theEVcharging and the PVproduction increases. The increase in electric driving range is negligible for <b>three-phase</b> <b>charging.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|While {{the first}} ACEA {{position}} paper (June 2010) has {{ruled out the}} Type 1 connector (based on the requirement of <b>three-phase</b> <b>charging</b> which is abundant in Europe and China but not in Japan and the USA) it has left open the question whether a Type 2 or Type 3 connector {{should be used for}} the uniform plug type in Europe. The rationale points to the fact that Mode 3 requires the socket to be dead when no vehicle is connected so {{that there can be no}} hazard that the shutter could protect from. The shutter protection of Type 3 connectors do only have advantages in Mode 2 allowing for a simpler charging station. On the other hand, a public charging station exposes the charging socket and plugs to a harsh environment where the shutter could easily have a malfunction which is not noticeable to the electric vehicle driver. Instead the ACEA expects that Type 2 Mode 3 connectors also to be used for home charging in the second phase after 2017 while still allowing Mode 2 charging with established plug types that are already available in home environments. The impact of some jurisdictions requiring shutters is still being debated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A <b>three-phase</b> battery <b>charger</b> for {{electric}} vehicles is proposed in this paper. The charger is bidirectional, allowing the Charging and Vehicle to Grid operation modes. A novel Balanced Sinusoidal Source Current control strategy is proposed {{so that the}} charger demands or injects into the grid a perfect sinusoidal and balanced source current in phase with the positive sequence fundamental component of the phase-to-neutral grid voltage, achieving a unity displacement power factor. In this way, the charger turns the car into a smart vehicle, reducing the existing problem of harmonic current demand by electric and hybrid vehicles and improving the power quality of the electric power system. The topology and control stage of the charger are shown. Simulation tests are conducted to validate the proper operation of the charger under sinusoidal, distorted and unbalanced source voltages...|$|R

40|$|For a plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV), the battery needs to be charged from the grid while the vehicle is parked. The traction system components are normally not engaged during the charging time so there is a possibility to use them in the charger system to develop an integrated charger.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new modeling framework for {{inclusion of the}} charging operations of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) within a three-phase unbalanced, residential, distribution system. Coordinated charging of the PEVs is proposed to minimize the total energy drawn from the substation, total losses {{in the system and}} the total cost of charging the PEVs. Detailed studies examine the impact of PEVs on the overall system load profile, bus load profiles, feeder currents, voltages, taps and capacitor switching. The proposed model can be used to maximize PEV charging over a 24 hour time-frame or the utilization of feeder capacity to charge the PEVs. A practical distribution test feeder is presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed model.

40|$|The {{influence}} of electric vehicle charging stations on power grid harmonics {{is becoming increasingly}} significant as their presence continues to grow. This paper studies the operational principles of the charging current in the continuous and discontinuous modes for a <b>three-phase</b> uncontrolled rectification <b>charger</b> with a passive power factor correction link, which {{is affected by the}} charging power. A parameter estimation method is proposed for the equivalent circuit of the charger by using the measured characteristic AC (Alternating Current) voltage and current data combined with the charging circuit constraints in the conduction process, and this method is verified using an experimental platform. The sensitivity of the current harmonics to the changes in the parameters is analyzed. An analytical harmonic model of the charging station is created by separating the chargers into groups by type. Then, the harmonic current amplification caused by the shunt active power filter is researched, and the analytical formula for the overload factor is derived to further correct the capacity of the shunt active power filter. Finally, this method is validated through a field test of a charging station...|$|R
