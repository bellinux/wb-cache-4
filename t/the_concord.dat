5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>concord</b> of harmonized melody.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> River.|$|E
5|$|Delaware Route 202 (DE 202), {{also known}} as Concord Avenue, is a short state highway in Wilmington, Delaware. It runs from U.S. Route 13 Business (US 13 Bus., Market Street) north to a {{modified}} cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 202 at the northern city limits. North of the interchange, the route becomes US 202 northbound, {{also known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> Pike. The road is two lanes and undivided {{for most of its}} length except for the part just south of the I-95 interchange, which is four lanes and divided. DE 202 was a part of US 202 until that highway was truncated to the I-95 interchange in 1970. DE 202 was designated by 1981.|$|E

5|$|Downes, in {{his role}} as DGMS, pressed for the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for the care of sick and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. Time soon vindicated his judgement; and today the major military hospitals in the state capital cities, <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2008, track {{inspector}} James Strickland {{was struck}} {{and killed by}} a train as he was walking along a section of track between <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> and Pleasant Hill stations. Strickland's death started an investigation into BART's safety alert procedures. At {{the time of the}} accident, BART had assigned trains headed in opposite directions to a shared track for routine maintenance. BART came under further fire in February 2009 for allegedly delaying payment of death benefits to Strickland's family.|$|E
5|$|The mill site in Billerica was {{not without}} some controversy. The dam, which had been {{constructed}} in the 1790s to provide water for the Middlesex Canal, was believed {{by some to be}} responsible for the flooding of fields upstream as far as Sudbury. There were calls to remove the dam, as well as legal action, which Talbot vigorously resisted. The dispute was partly played out in the state legislature, and brought Talbot to the attention of political leaders as a potential candidate for office. Talbot also opposed plans developed by the city of Boston to divert waters of the Sudbury River (a major tributary of <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> River) for its water supply.|$|E

Class 11 (Lu-) had already been assimilated to class 5 even in the 19th century in Chewa, but it still exists in some dialects of the {{neighbouring}} language Tumbuka. In addition, classes 4 and 9, and classes 15 and 17 have identical <b>concords,</b> so <b>the</b> total number of concord sets (singular and plural) is now twelve.|$|R

5|$|The town of Port Chicago {{was located}} on Suisun Bay in the estuary of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Suisun Bay is {{connected}} to the Pacific Ocean by San Francisco Bay. In 1944, the town was {{a little more than a}} mile from a U.S. Navy munitions depot, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, which was later expanded and renamed <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> Naval Weapons Station but is now called the Military Ocean Terminal Concord. The original magazine was planned in 1941 with construction beginning shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first ship to dock at Port Chicago was loaded on December 8, 1942.|$|E
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Talbot {{joined a}} weaving firm {{established}} by {{his older brother}} Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a carder and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing dyewoods in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot & Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing dyewoods {{for use in the}} textile industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, in partnership with the Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full control of that business in 1862. Thomas focused on the textile business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{seems to}} have moved around Greece {{in the months after}} the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and {{installing}} garrisons; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, that they should not try to oppose him. In mid 337 BC, he {{seems to have}} camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed {{in the latter half of}} 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta. The principal terms of <b>the</b> <b>concord</b> were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'. At Philip's behest, the synod of the league then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign.|$|E
5|$|The hurricane's {{effects were}} severe {{in the city}} of Charleston, where the storm {{produced}} northeasterly winds and heavy rainfall. The bulwark of the fort at nearby James Island was destroyed, and the palisades of the fort at Castle Pinckney were wrecked at the mouth of Charleston's harbor. The hurricane also swept vessels aground into marshes and wharves between Gadsden's Wharf and South Bay along the Cooper River. Several wharves—Pritchard's, Cochran's, Beale's, Craft's, and William's—were struck by vessels and consequently severely damaged. The Montserrat, Mary, Birmingham Packet, Amazon, and Orange all endured some degree of damage. Three vessels and the Mary collided with Governor's Bridge, which was impaired as a result; two vessels and the Favorite slammed into Faber's Wharf, while <b>the</b> <b>Concord</b> filled with water at Prioleau's Wharf, resulting in the loss of 50tierces of rice. A counting and scale house was separated from its foundation after being struck by the Lydia within the vicinity of Blake's Wharf, while the African slave boat Christopher capsized at Geyer's Wharf, with all aboard escaping safely. Four slaves drowned after a boat overturned in the Ashley River.|$|E
