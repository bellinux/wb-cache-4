5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>Like</b> all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E
5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a mouse.|$|E
5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to be}} part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which {{were designed}} to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak {{was similar to that}} of ducks, which indicates it may have likewise foraged in water, or browsed near <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, which indicates Deinocheirus had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>Like</b> other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} of Elasmothere morphology, nutrition and habits {{have been the}} cause of wide variation in reconstruction.

The use of the horn {{and whether or not}} there was one, and how large, have been popular topics. The statistical correlations of modern palaeontology have taken much of the speculation out of the subject, although some details remain undetermined.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, {{one giant}} African snail, Achatina fulica, lays 100 to 400 {{elliptical}} eggs that each measure about 5mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, {{usually in the}} wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> H. pomatia, or lay eggs {{on the surface of}} a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4mm long. These snails grow up to 10mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35mm long and may already be sexually mature. Sexual maturity takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of calcium. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with much}} of the central and {{northern}} California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. The summer fog and summer drought have the same underlying cause: a massive, stable seasonal high pressure system that forms over the north Pacific Ocean. The high pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly air flow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder sub surface water. The water vapor in the air contacting this cold water condenses into fog. The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day. Fog is an essential summer water source for many Big Sur coastal plants. While few plants can take water directly out of the air, water condensation on leaf surfaces slowly precipitates into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> rain.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
50|$|Hemingway {{converted}} a urinal obtained after a renovation at Sloppy Joe's bar into a {{water fountain}} in the yard, where {{it remains a}} prominent feature at the home, filled with water from the large Cuban jar and serving as one of many water sources for the grounds' cats. <b>The</b> <b>grounds</b> of <b>the</b> house are maintained as a garden, with many tropical plants installed after Hemingway moved to Cuba.

25|$|User-generated {{content is}} a major feature of Spore; there are {{eighteen}} different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and coloring parts, whether {{for the creation of}} a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take what looks like a lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a slug or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects.|$|E

[...] The most unusual {{characteristic}} of American Pharoah during his two- and three-year-old seasons is his short tail—it was apparently chewed off by another horse. It is theorized that Mr. Z, a fellow competitor and Zayat-bred colt, {{may have been the}} culprit; the pair were kept together in Florida as younger horses. Trainer Baffert had a more colorful theory: [...] "I think he was in the pasture one day and there was a mountain lion chasing him—that was the closest he could get..." ...|$|E
500|$|Witton {{also found}} that due to their {{relatively}} slighter flight-musculature, istiodactylids were adapted to launching from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> vultures, rather than from water like other ornithocheiroids. He also considered the fact that istiodactylid fossils are mainly found in sedimentary deposits that represent freshwater or brackish water, which received much terrestrial input, evidence that [...] supports the idea of them scavenging in terrestrial settings. Witton found it unlikely that istiodactylids and their relatives were especially proficient on the ground, due to their disproportionate limbs and small appendages, though {{they may have had}} relatively large thigh muscles. He also found the feet too small in relation to their body size to have been used for climbing or suspension, as had previously been suggested.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the factors}} Schölch {{attributes}} to Aqil's failure to secure an autonomous rule {{similar to that of}} the Arab sheikh Zahir al-Umar was Aqil's refusal to accept a sedentary life. While I'billin frequently functioned as a headquarters of sorts for Aqil, he did not take up permanent residence there, or anywhere. Instead it served as a symbol of his authority in the Galilee. Aqil was adamantly a Bedouin and once remarked to William Lynch that it would be a [...] "disgrace" [...] to [...] "till <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a fellah". The nomadic, marauding lifestyle of Aqil ran counter to the modernization efforts of the Ottomans, which strongly encouraged settlement of the land and centralization. These processes were eventually embraced by the peasantry and the urban notables, but resisted by the Bedouin tribes whose traditional livelihoods were at risk.|$|E
500|$|Sandstorms {{occur with}} much less {{frequency}} than dust storms. They are often preceded by severe dust storms and {{occur when the}} wind velocity increases {{to a point where}} it can lift heavier particles. These grains of sand, up to about [...] in diameter are jerked into the air but soon fall back to earth, ejecting other particles in the process.

500|$|Archaeopteryx {{continues}} {{to play an important}} part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the [...] "trees down" [...] hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by O. C. Marsh). Other scientists see Archaeopteryx as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the [...] "ground up" [...] hypothesis proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston). Still others suggest that Archaeopteryx might have been at home both in the trees and on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>like</b> modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that Archaeopteryx used its wings mainly to escape predators by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.|$|E

500|$|No further {{mention of}} William is made until the Siege of Antioch in 1098. The crusaders had {{successfully}} taken the city, but were then besieged themselves {{by a large}} Muslim army led by Kerbogha of Mosul. The crusaders suffered from lack of supplies, {{and there were many}} desertions; William fled Antioch in January 1098, along with the French monk Peter the Hermit, who had led his own army to Constantinople before the main crusaders arrived there. William was probably a member of Bohemond of Taranto's army at this point, because Bohemond sent his nephew Tancred to find them, and they were brought back to Bohemond's camp. Robert the Monk assumes that William fled because [...] "he had never before experienced such suffering from hunger." [...] William [...] "spent the whole of the night...in Bohemond's tent, lying on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> a piece of rubbish." [...] Bohemond rebuked him as a [...] "wretched disgrace to the whole Frankish army", and mentioned his desertion of the French army in Spain in 1087.

500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Lynch was {{enthusiastic}} about the medium of film, {{he realized that the}} wages from his job as a printer would not stretch to cover future budgetary needs. Bushnell Keeler [...] recommended that Lynch apply for a grant from the newly formed American Film Institute (AFI). Together with a copy of The Alphabet, Lynch's application included an eight-page treatment for a project titled The Grandmother. The submission was successful, and Lynch was awarded one of four annual grants from the AFI, totalling $5,000. The Grandmother was filmed in Lynch's home in Philadelphia and starred his friends and colleagues. Lynch's initial grant of $5,000 was later supplemented by a further $2,200 also supplied by the AFI. Completed in 1970, it relates the story of a family grown from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>like</b> plants; [...] the neglected and abused son seeks to create stability in his life by growing a grandmother from a seed. Once again, the film mixes animation with live action footage, and features the use of both pallid stage make-up reminiscent of the silent film era, and a similarly washed-out use of colour to The Alphabet. Running for thirty minutes, the film has been described by critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as [...] "fall into that twilight category of film that is too [...] short to be a feature and too long to be a short film".|$|E
