25|$|Among other charges, China accused India {{of illegal}} {{intrusion}} into its territory across mutually agreed China-India boundary and violation of its <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and UN Charter, while India accused China of changing {{status quo in}} violation of a 2012 understanding between the two governments regarding the tri-juction boundary points and causing security concerns, widely understood as at its strategic Siliguri Corridor.

25|$|With the First World War and its {{aftermath}} the number of states with diplomatic relations with the Holy See increased. For {{the first time since}} relations were broken between the Pope and Queen Elizabeth I of England, a British diplomatic mission to the Holy See was opened in 1914. The result was that, instead of diminishing, the number of diplomats accredited to the Holy See grew from sixteen in 1871 to twenty-seven in 1929, even before it again acquired <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> with the founding of the State of Vatican City.|$|E
25|$|Theories on the {{formation}} of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread {{around the world with}} colonialism.

25|$|The {{return to}} {{systemic}} agriculture {{coincided with the}} introduction of a new social system called feudalism. This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations. Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latter's protection. This made for confusion of <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory. Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records. Even land ownership disputes were decided based solely on oral testimony. Territoriality was reduced to a network of personal allegiances.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{extinction}} of the Papal States in 1870, and the consequent loss of <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> {{and in spite of}} some uncertainty among jurists as to whether it could continue to act as an independent personality in international matters, the Holy See continued in fact to exercise the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives, maintaining relations with states that included the major powers of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary. Countries continued to receive nuncios as diplomatic representatives of full rank, and where, in accordance with the decision of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Nuncio was not only a member of the Diplomatic Corps but its Dean, this arrangement continued to be accepted by the other ambassadors.|$|E
25|$|Formosa and the Penghu islands {{were put}} under the {{administrative}} {{control of the}} Republic of China (ROC) government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The ROC proclaimed Taiwan Retrocession Day on October 25, 1945. However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco, as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement. Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.|$|E

500|$|The South African {{military}} attacked {{insurgents in}} Cunene Province on 12 May 1980. The Angolan Ministry of Defense accused the South African government of wounding and killing civilians. Nine days later, the SADF attacked again, {{this time in}} Cuando-Cubango, and the MPLA threatened to respond militarily. The SADF launched a full-scale invasion of Angola through Cunene and Cuando-Cubango on 7 June, destroying SWAPO's operational command headquarters on 13 June, in what Prime Minister Pieter Willem Botha described as a [...] "shock attack". The MPLA government arrested 120 Angolans who were planning to set off explosives in Luanda, on 24 June, foiling a plot purportedly orchestrated by the South African government. Three days later, the United Nations Security Council convened {{at the behest of}} Angola's ambassador to the UN, E. de Figuerido, and condemned South Africa's incursions into Angola. President Mobutu of Zaire also sided with the MPLA. The MPLA government recorded 529 instances in which they claim South African forces violated Angola's <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> between January and June 1980.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} {{territorial}} claims in Antarctica, the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land (along with its claim of Peter I Island) {{is subject to}} the Antarctic Treaty System. The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity. It promotes international scientific cooperation and bans any nuclear-related activities. Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty, all claims under Article III of the treaty are in effect suspended {{as long as it is}} in force. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other's claims in Antarctica. But there is a question on the actual boundaries of the claim, since the initial Norwegian demarcations both towards the South Pole and into the sea were left unclear. [...] Apparently this was to avoid accepting use of the [...] "sector principle" [...] for Arctic Ocean claims by the Soviet Union. [...] However, in 2015 the Norwegian Parliament specified that its national claim extended to the Pole. [...] Since, as noted above, Article III of the Antarctic Treaty specifically states that, [...] "No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim to <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in Antarctica shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force", this leaves the matter uncertain.|$|E
500|$|Many {{commentators}} saw {{the film}} as a message {{of support for the}} struggles of native peoples today. Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, praised Avatar for its [...] "profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle for the defense of nature". Others compared the human invaders with [...] "NATO in Iraq or Israel in Palestine", and considered it reassuring that [...] "when the Na'vi clans are united, and a sincere prayer is offered, the... 'primitive savages' win the war." [...] Palestinian activists painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na'vi during their weekly protest in the village of Bilin against Israel's separation barrier. [...] Other Arab writers, however, noted that [...] "for Palestinians, Avatar is rather a reaffirmation and confirmation of the claims about their incapability to lead themselves and build their own future." [...] Forbes columnist Reihan Salam criticized the vilification of capitalism in the film, asserting that it represents a more noble and heroic way of life than that led by the Na'vi, because it [...] "give everyone an opportunity to learn, discover, and explore, and to change the world around us." [...] Si Sheppard on the other hand praised the film for drawing parallels between the corporate imperialism of the fictional RDA and its historical equivalents of the pre-industrial era (specifically the East India Company, which maintained its own private army in order to impose profit-driven <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> at the expense of indigenous peoples).|$|E

500|$|The Court {{agreed with}} Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's {{argument that the}} island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in Southeast Asia since it came into existence in 1512. As Pedra Branca had always been known as a navigational hazard in the Singapore Strait, which was a vital channel for international navigation in east-west trade between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, it was inconceivable that the island had remained undiscovered by the local community. It was therefore reasonable to infer that Pedra Branca lay within the general geographical scope of the Johor Sultanate. Further, during {{the existence of the}} old Johor Sultanate, {{there was no evidence of}} any competing claims over the islands in the Singapore Strait. It also agreed with Malaysia's submission that descriptions of the relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the Orang Laut in 19th-century official British reports proved that the Sultan exercised sovereign authority over the Orang Laut. Since the Orang Laut made the islands in the Singapore Strait their habitat, this confirmed the [...] "ancient original title" [...] of the Johor Sultanate to those islands, including Pedra Branca. As regards Singapore's argument that the traditional concept of Malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory, the Court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory. However, it was not necessary to deal with the point further as it had already found that Johor had <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Pedra Branca.|$|E

40|$|Studies in transnationalism {{raise the}} {{expectation}} that new forms of ‘flexible citizenship’ will attune the frozen world of <b>territorial</b> <b>sovereignties</b> and citizenship {{to the reality of}} global migration and borderless business. In the Netherlands, however, the focus of the integration debate has recently shifted to an affirmation of sovereignty. Three cases in which ethnic minorities in the Netherlands were exposed to (possible) action from their homelands (Turkey and Morocco) elicited political discussion in which dual citizenship and transnational political influence were rejected. We conclude that a changed policy of homeland governments (diaspora engagement) is not the most likely explanation of the public excitement. The new sovereignty discourse fits into a neo-nationalist trend but may also be explained as a way to contain the unpredictable effects of the sustained multiculturalism underlying Dutch policy toward migrant communities...|$|R
