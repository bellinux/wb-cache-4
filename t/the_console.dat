5|$|Joy and Bing Bong {{try to use}} Bing Bong's old wagon rocket {{to escape}} the Memory Dump, but after several tries, Bing Bong realizes their {{combined}} weight is too much and jumps out, sacrificing himself to allow Joy to escape. Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and manages {{to get them to}} Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled <b>the</b> <b>console,</b> rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of <b>the</b> <b>console</b> to Sadness, who is able to successfully extract the idea, reactivating <b>the</b> <b>console</b> and prompting Riley to return home.|$|E
5|$|The {{controls}} {{available to}} the organist, including the keyboards, couplers, expression pedals, stops, and registration aids are accessed from <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> <b>The</b> <b>console</b> is either built into the organ case or detached from it.|$|E
5|$|The {{most modern}} actions are {{primarily}} electronic, which connect <b>the</b> <b>console</b> and windchests via narrow data cables {{instead of the}} larger multiconductor cables of electric actions. Boxes containing small embedded computers in <b>the</b> <b>console</b> and near the windchests translate console commands into fast serial data for the cable, and back into electrical commands at the windchest.|$|E
50|$|Released {{alongside}} <b>the</b> GameCube <b>console,</b> <b>the</b> standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design. This controller was bundled {{with all}} new GameCube systems throughout <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> life cycle {{and was also}} available separately. It connects to <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> controller ports via a 2 m/6.5 ft cable.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the name}} Zemmix, Daewoo {{released}} {{a series of}} gaming <b>consoles</b> compatible with <b>the</b> MSX home computer standards. <b>The</b> <b>consoles</b> were in production between 1985 and 1995. <b>The</b> <b>consoles</b> were not sold outside South Korea.|$|R
2500|$|The PSP {{received}} generally positive reviews {{soon after}} launch and most reviewers cited similar strengths and weaknesses. CNET awarded the system an 8.5 out of 10 and praised <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities while lamenting {{the lack of}} a screen guard or a guard over the reading surface of UMD cartridges. Engadget applauded <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> design, stating that [...] "it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld". PC World commended Sony's decision to include built-in Wi-Fi capability, but criticized {{the lack of a}} web browser at launch and the glare and smudges that resulted from <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> shiny exterior. Most reviewers also praised <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> large and bright viewing screen and its audio and video playback capabilities. In 2008, Time listed the PSP as a [...] "gotta have travel gadget", citing <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> movie selection, telecommunications capability, and upcoming GPS functionality.|$|R
5|$|When {{electrical}} wiring alone {{is used to}} connect <b>the</b> <b>console</b> to the windchest, electric actions allow <b>the</b> <b>console</b> to be separated at any practical distance {{from the rest of}} the organ, and to be movable. Electric stop actions can be controlled at <b>the</b> <b>console</b> by stop knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights. Some may include electromagnets for setting or resetting when combinations are selected.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} some {{differences}} in the interface between platforms, unlike other games such as Firaxis' Civilization Revolution, the content is not simplified for <b>the</b> <b>console</b> versions. The PC version features a mouse-driven UI.|$|E
5|$|As a pack-in {{title for}} the SNES, Super Mario World helped popularise <b>the</b> <b>console</b> and became the best-selling game of its generation.|$|E

The Zeebo can also perform [...] "over-the-air" [...] (OTA) updates to <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> firmware—delivering new content, features and bug fixes.|$|R
50|$|Players {{can perform}} their character's actions by using <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> analog stick and buttons (for {{movement}} and normal attacks) and by touching <b>the</b> <b>console's</b> touch screens (for special sequences). The game's system is created {{in this manner}} to let the player be directly responsible for their mistakes and actions.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E

50|$|Mozilla {{came with}} three Web {{development}} tools — a DOM Inspector, Venkman and JavaScript <b>Console.</b> <b>The</b> DOM Inspector {{was not available}} in non-Mozilla browsers, and <b>the</b> JavaScript <b>Console</b> was more advanced than <b>the</b> <b>consoles</b> available in non-Mozilla browsers. Venkman was a difficult to use but decent JavaScript debugger. These were installed by default, though you could opt them out (except for <b>the</b> JavaScript <b>Console)</b> with <b>the</b> other install options.|$|R
50|$|Ronimo Games {{announced}} a PlayStation 4 release, co-developed with Abstraction Games with improvements and updates from the PC version {{as well as}} DLC, on 14 August 2013, intended for release with <b>the</b> <b>console’s</b> launch. <b>The</b> PlayStation 4 version, entitled Awesomenauts Assemble!, was released on 4 March 2014 following a delay to <b>the</b> <b>console’s</b> launch window.|$|R

5|$|It succeeded the GameCube, {{and early}} models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first spoke of <b>the</b> <b>console</b> at the E3 2004 {{press conference and}} later {{unveiled}} it at E3 2005. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata revealed a prototype of the controller at the September 2005 Tokyo Game Show. At E3 2006, <b>the</b> <b>console</b> won {{the first of several}} awards. By December 8, 2006, it had completed its launch in the four key markets.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Dragon Quest VI did {{not receive}} an English-language {{localization}} because of being cost-ineffective. At 4MB, {{it was one of}} the largest games made for the SNES as well as the largest <b>the</b> <b>console</b> could support without adding bank-switching circuitry to the cartridge, and translating it would have necessitated even bigger and more expensive ROMs. In addition, the game was a late release for the SNES and by the time an English localization could be finished, Enix had already dropped support for <b>the</b> <b>console</b> in North America and moved to the PlayStation.|$|E

5|$|Slalom was {{developed}} by British video game company Rare by Tim and Chris Stamper. Rare had been looking to develop games for consoles {{in the wake of}} rampant computer game piracy in the United Kingdom. They chose the NES for its nascent popularity, though <b>the</b> <b>console</b> had no Western developers, and asked Nintendo for a license. When Nintendo declined, they reverse engineered <b>the</b> <b>console</b> and made a demo, Slalom to show the company. Nintendo was astonished at their effort, and made Rare its first Western developer, beginning a long and close collaboration between Rare and Nintendo of America founder and president Minoru Arakawa.|$|E
5|$|The N-Gage {{version of}} X-Men Legends {{contains}} {{most of the}} features found on <b>the</b> <b>console</b> versions. However, {{the game is played}} from an isometric point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. Cutscenes were reused from <b>the</b> <b>console</b> versions, but are rendered at a much lower frame rate. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology.|$|E

The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live television to Android and Windows devices if <b>the</b> <b>console</b> is using a USB digital television tuner.|$|E

5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. <b>The</b> <b>console</b> was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on <b>the</b> <b>console</b> so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate <b>the</b> <b>console,</b> the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>console</b> {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since <b>the</b> <b>console</b> is restricted to Nintendo GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>console</b> {{versions}} {{have additional}} songs composed by Akitaka Tohyama, Taku Inoue, Yoshihito Yano, Ryo Watanabe, Go Shiina, Rio Hamamoto, Nobuyoshi Sano, Keiichi Okabe, Shinji Hosoe, Ayako Saso, Yuu Miyake, and Keigo Hoashi.|$|E
