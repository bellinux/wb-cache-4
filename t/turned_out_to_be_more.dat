At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.|$|E
5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced {{the men to}} dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified {{to discover that the}} entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut {{on the side of}} his head. Although he laughed it off at first, the injury <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|With Taurasi {{joining the}} core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma {{confidently}} predicted another championship in 2001, but the season <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East Tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first National Championship.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are {{the winged}} orders of insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera have <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> closely related to the Endopterygota than {{to the rest of the}} Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E

25|$|They also {{qualified}} in the 2003 PBA Invitationals, {{where four}} guest teams were invited. Joel Banal left {{the team for}} the moment to concentrate on his Ateneo Blue Eagles stint in the UAAP. The Phone Pals did not qualify for the semis, but not without controversy. Needing to win by eight points over Red Bull Barako to qualify, the Phone Pals deliberately fouled several Red Bull players {{in the last two}} minutes to force an overtime or even reach the needed eight point margin. The game <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> disgraceful when Jojo Manalo tried to hit a three-pointer on Red Bull's basket.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the new icebreaker was awarded to Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab and the work began in March 1937. Previously, the Helsinki-based shipyard had completed the unfinished Voima in 1924 and built a port icebreaker {{for the city of}} Helsinki in 1936. On 24 September 1938, the vessel was given the name Sisu, a Finnish word describing will, determination and perseverance, that had been chosen by the Finnish schoolchildren. The sponsor of the vessel was Walborg Jokinen, the wife of the late Captain Ilmari Jokinen. While Sisu was delivered behind the original 20-month schedule and the vessel <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> expensive as predicted, she was generally considered to be a successful design. She was handed over to the Finnish Board of Navigation in March 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of ordering the new multipurpose icebreaker {{was made in}} late 2004 and the Finnish Environment Institute and the Finnish Maritime Administration were authorized by the Government to make an agreement on the vessel and launch a request for tenders in early 2005. The new oil spill response vessel was expected to enter service in 2007. However, only a few offers were received and the new vessel, for which 134 million euro was reserved in the budget, <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> expensive than expected. After evaluating more economic alternatives in October 2005 the committee working on the project came to a conclusion that a new multipurpose oil recovery vessel would still be the best solution to improve spill response readiness. 35 million euro were allocated for the purchasing of the new vessel.|$|E

Next, however, Papua New Guinea, winning the toss and batting, posted 230ao thanks to 55 by Amini and no less than 54 extras; this profligacy with the ball cost them the game as they fell to 193ao (MO Odumbe 64) and a 37-run defeat. Finally in Group A, the USA chose to bat first against the Papuans, and their choice was vindicated as their shaky-looking 190ao (KR Khan 52) <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than sufficient, E Daley claiming 4â€“35 as the United States recorded a 67-run triumph.|$|E

25|$|On April 11, 1997 {{developer}} Rubin, hotelier Jonathan Tisch and Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell {{announced in}} the PSFS boardroom that the PSFS Building would be converted into a Loews Hotel. Over the next year {{the conversion of the}} building into a hotel was delayed while Loews negotiated with the Rubin Organization to buy out its interest in the building. An agreement was formally reached in June 1998, and work began on the building shortly thereafter. After a year-long delay on starting the renovations, there were concerns more delays would occur if the building's conversion <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult than first thought. The concern stemmed from the city's attempt to attract a political convention to the city in 2000. A key part of attracting a political convention was the number of available hotel rooms in the host city, and completion of the PSFS Building on time was an important factor.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo â€“ accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E
