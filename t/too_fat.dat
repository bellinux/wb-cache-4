5|$|A mutant with {{a nearly}} indestructible layer of skin. In the film's early sequences, he is a {{formidable}} fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E
25|$|Sadamasa Arikawa (who {{worked with}} Eiji Tsuburaya) {{said that the}} sculptors {{had a hard time}} coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya. The first suit was {{rejected}} for being <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> with long legs giving Kong an almost cute look. A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|E

Something is always wrong with those he meets, and he cannot be certain they are real princesses because they have bad table manners or they are <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> or thin or not beautiful. [...] One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She {{claims to be a}} princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices.

500|$|Chimes at Midnight premiered to a {{positive}} audience reception at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. However, after New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year. Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not {{regarded as one of}} Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it [...] "a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters...designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff." [...] Welles' performance, he said, was [...] "a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus." [...] Penelope Houston called it [...] "a film which seems to turn its back on brilliance." [...] A Time review also criticized Welles, stating that [...] " [...] is probably the first actor {{in the history of the}} theater to appear <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> for the role...he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English", but that he is [...] "never entirely bad." ...|$|E

[...] The first French attack was apparently repelled but the French commander [...] Le Seigneur de Tais rallied his troops. [...] A second attack was launched, with the French forces in the 'array' fighting formation. [...] The account concludes by claiming that, after heavy casualties on both sides, the English line broke and the militia routed, and that Captain Robert Fyssher shouted an offer of £100 for anyone who could bring him a horse to escape, his being <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> to run. [...] Sir John Oglander is claimed to have said: “but none could be had even for a kingdom”.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E

Packard et al. (2009) tested dinosaur mass estimation procedures on elephants and concluded that those of dinosaurs are flawed and produce over-estimations; thus, the weight of Tyrannosaurus, as well as other dinosaurs, could have been much less. Other estimations have concluded that the largest known Tyrannosaurus specimens had masses approaching or exceeding 9 tonnes.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the episode}} {{prominently}} features and mocks animal rights and environmental activist Paul Watson and his Animal Planet reality series, Whale Wars. Watson has received wide criticism for his method of disrupting whale hunts by at times attacking and sinking Japanese and Norwegian whaling ships. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] presents Watson and his {{show in a}} way that mocks his attempts to garner media attention by simply lying rather than doing anything productive. The episode mocks Whale Wars and its attempts to present mundane ship-board activities as dramatic television. This is particularly illustrated in newspaper headlines after Stan takes over Watson's ship: [...] "New Captain Turns Vegan Pussies Into Real Pirates" [...] and [...] "Whale Wars Gets Better: Things Actually Happen!" [...] Watson himself is also portrayed in a physically unflattering way, with his stomach <b>too</b> <b>fat</b> to be entirely covered by his shirt. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] also refers to the criticisms that Watson bends the truth in order to further his popularity. This is particularly reflected through the fictional interview with Larry King, who calls Watson [...] "an unorganized, incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause". The fact that Whale Wars gets better ratings after Stan takes over and employs more violent tactics is a satire of the tendency in Whale Wars, and television in general, to exploit violence for money and viewership.|$|E

[...] The poet and journalist Théophile Gautier, in a review of The Wager (1846), performed by Legrand at the Funambules, also missed [...] "that unusually long musculature in the legs and arms—natural in some , obtained in others by dint of hard work—which allowed Mazurier and Ravel to execute their astonishing leaps", and he counseled lessons in [...] "the difficult art ... of delivering and receiving the kick." [...] But Legrand's schooling had been in the roles of the lover Leander, not in those of the acrobatic zanni; he brought a dramatic (and romantic) sensibility to his Pierrot. [...] And soon Gautier began to value the difference: when Legrand appeared in Marquis Pierrot (1847), a pantomime by Champfleury, Gautier compared him, in the range and finesse of his acting, to the great comic actor : [...] "inasmuch as he is humble, piteous, melancholy, greedy, wheedling, stealthy, endearing, hypocritical {{in the first part of}} the piece, so is he arrogant, insolent, scornful—a regular Marquis de Moncade—in the second. [...] What unprecedented truthfulness, what depth of observation ... It was not the musculature but the mask that was important to Legrand, as Gautier gradually realized: [...] "How many shades of feeling," [...] he wrote of Legrand's performance in The Brigands for Laughs (1857), [...] "how many ideas he summoned beneath this thick layer of flour that serves him as mask!" ...|$|E
