5|$|From the Middle Ages onwards, {{the city}} of Cluj has been a {{multicultural}} city with a diverse cultural and religious life. According to the 2011 Romanian census, of <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> data are available, 81.5% {{of the population of}} the city are ethnic Romanians, with the second largest ethnic group being the Hungarians, who make up 16.4% of the population. The remainder is composed of Romani (1.1%), Germans (0.18%), Jews (0.05%) and others (0.7%). (<b>Those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> data were unavailable accounted for 7.1%.) Today, the city receives a large influx of migrants: 25,000 people requested residence in the city during 2007.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, among <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> there were data, 71.3% of the {{population}} in 2011 were Romanian Orthodox and 10.6% were Reformed. The Roman Catholic and the Romanian Greek-Catholic communities claimed 5.0% and 4.7% {{of the population}} respectively, while other religious groups like Pentecostals (2.7%), Baptists (1.2%), or Unitarians (1.0%) rounded out most of the rest. (Data were unavailable for 7.9% of inhabitants.) By contrast, in 1930, the city was 26.7% Reformed, 22.6% Greek Catholic, 20.1% Roman Catholic, 13.4% Jewish, 11.8% Orthodox, 2.4% Lutheran and 2.1% Unitarian. Contributing factors for these shifts were the extermination and emigration of the city's Jews, the outlawing of the Greek-Catholic Church (1948–89) and the gradual decline in the Hungarian population.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

25|$|Hence, for Calvin, one {{is saved}} by {{becoming}} united to Christ through faith.

25|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy, {{also known}} as a stool transplant, is {{approximately}} 85% to 90% effective in <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> antibiotics have not worked.

The procedure replaces normal, healthy colonic flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by Clostridium difficile. Side effects, at least initially, are few.|$|E

25|$|To pave way {{for such}} {{reservation}} scheme, the Constitution of India was amended (the 93rd Constitutional Amendment, originally drafted as 104th Amendment Bill).

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died {{for those who would}} believe, so that <b>those</b> <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E
