2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "Once Upon a Time has taken us pretty much everywhere {{in and out of}} fairy tale lore over the past five years: Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest, Arendelle, Neverland. <b>Tonight,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> return marking the show's midseason premiere, as well as its landmark 100th episode, Once gave us something old (daddy issues), something new (the Underworld), something borrowed (a potion) and something blue (that classic Hades hair)," [...] but later sums up the entire episode: [...] "I know we're going to be dealing with a lot of returning cast in the coming weeks, but admittedly, I was a wee bit let down by the fact this was touted as Once's big reunion episode, and the only significant people we saw from the past were Neal, Cora, and Pan. What I am happy about, though, is the prospect that Regina may end up being wholly important to this Underworld story line. Maybe she'll finally get an arc that's more than just waffling between good and evil. More importantly, it seems like everyone in the Underworld is either in cahoots with Hades or being manipulated by him in some way. Both Pan and Cora were keen on persuading their still-living significant family members, with Cora asking Regina to leave and Pan asking Rumple to save him. I'm interested in seeing exactly what's going on in this little corner of hell and exactly how Once is going to wade through this new road of storytelling.|$|E
2500|$|ABC Evening News began airing in 1953, {{hosted by}} John Charles Daly. [...] Daly {{had been a}} {{well-known}} CBS radio correspondent, though today he is best remembered as the emcee of CBS's long-running game show, What's My Line?, which he hosted while serving as ABC's anchorman. [...] Daly left ABC in 1960 and was succeeded by a frequently expanding list of successors that included John Cameron Swayze, Bill Laurence, Bill Sheehan, Ron [...] Cochran, a young Peter Jennings, and Bob Young. [...] In 1968, Frank Reynolds became anchor of the program, and it soon expanded from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. [...] A year later, Howard K. Smith joined as co-anchor, reporting from Washington. [...] In early 1971, Harry Reasoner left CBS News and replaced Reynolds as the New York anchor. [...] Reasoner became the sole anchor in 1975, and Smith provided commentaries. [...] In 1976, Barbara Walters joined the program as Reasoner's co-anchor in New York, thus becoming {{the first woman to}} serve as a regular network news anchor. (Marlene Sanders had previously served as an occasional substitute anchor). Other women who would occasionally appear in daytime and weekend anchor roles in earlier days were Pauline Frederick of ABC and NBC and Nancy Dickerson of NBC. From the early 1970s forward, females such as Lesley Stahl of CBS, Carole Simpson of ABC and Jessica Savitch of NBC began to appear in significant on-camera newscasting roles. [...] Reasoner was very unhappy with the addition of Walters, and the two did not work well together. [...] In 1978, a year after Roone Arledge became President of ABC News, the ABC Evening News was [...] succeeded by ABC World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trio of anchors: Frank Reynolds, Peter Jennings and Max Robinson. Jennings assumed solo anchor responsibility in 1983 following Reynolds's death.|$|E

5000|$|However Metro's {{review of}} episode 7 was {{slightly}} more positive saying [...] "Life's Too Short bowed out <b>tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> episode {{that was more}} than marginally better than the six previous offerings, not only was the plot stronger than in previous weeks, but there were some genuinely funny scenes too, most notably a discussion between Gervais and Merchant about charity.

And there's no cause to be downhearted, for he'll very soon get better, very soon. Won't he, won't he, Ned?' ...|$|E
60|$|Father Brown, {{though he}} knew every detail done behind the scenes, and had even evoked applause by his {{transformation}} of a pillow into a pantomime baby, went round {{to the front and}} sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. The spectators were few, relations, one or two local friends, and the servants; Sir Leopold sat in the front seat, his full and still fur-collared figure largely obscuring the view of the little cleric behind him; but it has never been settled by artistic authorities whether the cleric lost much. The pantomime was utterly chaotic, yet not contemptible; there ran through it a rage of improvisation which came chiefly from Crook the clown. Commonly he was a clever man, and he was inspired <b>tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wild omniscience, a folly wiser than the world, that which comes to a young man who has seen for an instant a particular expression on a particular face. He {{was supposed to be the}} clown, but he was really almost everything else, the author (so far as there was an author), the prompter, the scene-painter, the scene-shifter, and, above all, the orchestra. At abrupt intervals in the outrageous performance he would hurl himself in full costume at the piano and bang out some popular music equally absurd and appropriate.|$|E

50|$|In September 2001, Global {{replaced}} Canada <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new network newscast, Global National, {{anchored by}} Kevin Newman (now presented by Dawna Friesen). It aired from the network's new national news centre at CHAN-TV's studio in Burnaby, British Columbia. The program initially aired only on weekdays, then launched a weekend edition anchored by Tara Nelson (now at CTV Calgary) in February 2005 (now presented by Robin Gill). Originally airing in different timeslots around the country, the program {{moved to a}} standard 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. Atlantic) start time nationwide in 2006. Since then, Global National has quickly gained ground on longtime number-one CTV National News, overtaking it on several occasions.

5000|$|A {{succession}} of 12-inch singles followed Might Do Something Wrong, including Alix Alvarez’s mix of How’s Your Life and the romantic dance-pop of Fall in Love. Billboard dance critic Michael Paoletta lauded the latter track by {{calling it a}} sterling, soul-slammed house jam. Each of the singles impressed the bevy of the world’s dance halls, allowing the band to tour heavily with appearances at clubs and festivals across the US. With 2006’s Introducing Tortured Soul, the band was able to piece together their first debut album using all their earlier singles while also incorporating a few new studio additions. The follow-up album, 2009’s Did You Miss Me, released on the band’s own label, TSTC Records, ushered in {{a new wave of}} critical acclaim, climactically winning accolades from various music publications like Blues and Soul, SoulTracks and SoulBounce. Home to You, In My Fantasy and Your Dream Is My Dream were all given the 12" [...] and 7" [...] singles’ treatment. Continuing their regimen for clubland rituals, Tortured Soul employed an attractive A-list of DJs and remixers to carefully handle the mixes for their latest batch of uptempo dancefloor fillers, including Mark de Clive-Lowe, Quentin Harris, Jon Cutler, DJ Spinna, Dimitri From Paris and remix pioneer Tom Moulton. In 2015 the band released a third album, Hot For Your Love <b>Tonight,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> music video for the single [...] "Don't Lead Me On." [...] Most recently two new singles, [...] "Makin' Me Better" [...] and [...] "U Live 2 Far Away," [...] along with remixes of both by JKriv, Lounge Lizards, Ron Trent and more.|$|E

5000|$|On June 1, 2009, Conan O'Brien (who {{had succeeded}} Letterman {{as host of}} Late Night in 1993) took over as host of The Tonight Show—an event Letterman {{referenced}} in his own show's Top Ten List on that night—and Letterman's [...] "feud" [...] with Leno temporarily ceased. In 2008 Letterman told Rolling Stone that he would welcome Leno on his show once Leno's tenure ended. Letterman said on competing with O'Brien, [...] "I still {{find it hard to}} believe that Jay won’t be there." [...] The interview was held prior to Leno announcing his return to NBC for The Jay Leno Show. In the second week after Letterman and O'Brien began their opposing broadcasts, viewer ratings for Tonight began to slip and Late Show was poised to beat Tonight for the first time in over ten years, a fact pointed out by Letterman's guests on air (Howard Stern and Julia Roberts). Letterman quickly tried to change the subject in the interviews and tried to avert a new rivalry. In fact, the June 9, 2009 episode of Late Show featuring Roberts rated better than <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3.4 household rating nationally to O'Brien's 2.9. The Letterman/Leno feud was revived in the wake of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict, which saw Letterman side with O'Brien. Despite the rivalry, Leno appeared in a Late Show promo with Letterman and Oprah Winfrey which aired on CBS during Super Bowl XLIV; it was Leno and Letterman's first joint appearance since Leno took over the Tonight Show in 1992. The feud between the hosts ended for good on February 6, 2014 with Leno's second and final retirement and Late Night host Jimmy Fallon, who succeeded Conan O'Brien in 2009, becoming the current host of the Tonight Show on February 17, with its subsequent return to New York for the first time since 1972.|$|E

At the beginning of every episode, there is a candid disclaimer, voiced by Andre Chichak (portrayed by Alaric Tay), telling the viewers that the stories are not true, most notably by using the line 'Believing us is like believing that...'
