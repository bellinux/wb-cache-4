5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, {{probably}} by the Praters: <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> enlarged to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was built around the inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen antique {{terracotta}} medallions {{adorn the}} balustrade of the gallery's first floor, representing Roman emperors and influenced by Italian architecture. Surrounded by a thick garland {{of fruits and}} flowers, these medallions were originally painted green to suggest bronze and distinguish the façade. The building's perforated railings are inspired by the François I wing of the Château de Blois. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> probably added during the late-nineteenth-century restoration. Dismantled in 1812, the northern galleries were originally supported by two sets of six white marble columns (rarely found in sixteenth-century buildings).|$|E
5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton. About {{two thirds of the}} town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E

5|$|It was Dufourny's {{great friend}} and fellow {{architect}} Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main façade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} at 5 Buckingham Gate, Kensington (Adare); at Ashley Place, Westminster (Adare); at Victoria Street, Westminster (Lindsay). There was a ledge 4 inches wide below the windows (Adare); a ledge 1½ inches wide (Lindsay); no foothold at all (Lindsay); balconies 7 feet apart (Adare); no balconies at all (Lindsay). <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> 85 feet from the street (Lindsay); 70 feet (Lindsay); 80 feet (Home); {{on the third floor}} (Adare); on the first floor (Adare).

5|$|The Sognsvann Line was {{finished}} upgraded to metro standard on 7 January 1993, allowing the first T1000 trains to operate through the Common Tunnel into the western network, converting {{parts of the}} Oslo Tramway to metro. The Røa Line {{was finished}} on 19 November 1995, allowing all trains from the east to operate through the city center. To have sufficient metro-compatible trains, six two-car T2000 units were bought, and during the mid-1990s {{were considered to be}} a possible replacement for the T1000s. Starting in 1995, Oslo Sporveier made an interior and livery upgrade to the T1000 trains. The main red color to the exterior was kept, but the doors and around <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> painted blue. The lights and seats were changed, and the latter colored gray. The interior walls were painted red at the end, white on the sides, blue on the doors and received yellow hand bars.|$|E

25|$|In 1892–94 {{the nave}} and chancel walls were {{repaired}} and <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> renewed. In 1907–09 the nave roof was extensively repaired. A fire in 1918 gutted the tower, which was restored in 1922. Later restoration included the tower stonework in 1952–55, the chancel roof in 1963, {{and the surface}} of the nave roof in 1976.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} type of vaulted roof is {{the barrel}} vault {{in which a}} single arched surface extends from wall to wall, {{the length of the}} space to be vaulted, for example, the nave of a church. An important example, which retains Medieval paintings, is the vault of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, France, of the early 12th century.
