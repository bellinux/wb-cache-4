5000|$|The {{spinning}} mule or {{mule jenny}} {{was created in}} 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It {{was a combination of}} Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the throstle frame or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn <b>twisted</b> and <b>wrapped</b> in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} technological parameters of spinning of 100 % CV Vortex yarns of different counts and its selected geometrical parameters (a lead of helix of wrapping fibre ribbon, yarn diameter) as well as yarn properties. The number of <b>twist</b> of <b>wrapping</b> fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the main draft on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of open-end rotor spun yarns. Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in combination with spindle diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the main draft of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex yarn. Tested rotor spun yarns had a larger diameter, higher hairiness, lower tenacity and higher elongation, lower mass irregularity and number of imperfections, higher abrasion resistance and lower bending rigidity compared to tested Vortex spun yarns...|$|R

The two embrace each other, and their bodies <b>twist</b> and <b>wrap</b> together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|R

2500|$|Technological {{developments}} such as crude ceramics {{were developed}} by Archaic societies early during the late Holocene. A total of 792 shards of pottery were found at Indian Knoll. All of which were shell or grit tempered, [...] mainly found within the first {{foot and a half}} of the mound, and closely relate to the later Mississippian culture's pottery. Most vessels had wide mouths and curved or flat bases, which were handmade by building up coils of clay. Pottery contributed to the exploitation and manipulation of wild plants, and more efficiency in food processing and water storage. The most common type of ceramics were shell tempered, representing 78.5% of the total pottery shards found at Indian Knoll, with only 171 grit tempered shards of bowls or jars discovered. Heavy grit tempered pottery appeared in different regions of the Eastern Woodlands, including Ohio Valley, between 2000-500 BC. The grit tempered ceramics that were found show plain and cord marked ware, as well as simple stamped grooved patterns. Several different finishes on shell tempered ceramics were also noted. [...] Nine shards found in one were also cord marked, or tapped with a <b>twisted</b> fibers <b>wrapped</b> [...] paddle, and three shards show signs of roughening, which were individually created by a rectangular object. Other shards show signs of net impressions caused by [...] mesh fabrics, which is common in much of western Kentucky.|$|R
30|$|Typical {{elements}} that are important for soft robotics applications are soft actuators. Basically, a soft actuator consists of a stretchable part and one (or more) non-stretchable (but bendable) part(s); see Fig. 2. Depending on the function, the non-stretchable part of the soft actuator can be arranged as follows. For bending, it {{is placed on the}} outer surface of the actuator (Fig. 2, left). For extending, it is integrated into the actuator, for example, in a zigzag manner (Fig. 2, center). And for <b>twisting,</b> it is <b>wrapped</b> around the actuator (Fig. 2, right). The actuation is realized, for example, by using length-variable tendons or by dividing the stretchable part into one (or more) inflatable chamber(s) [14]. Furthermore, other principles for soft actuators exist to perform, for example, curling [6, 15], contracting [16, 17], rotating [18 – 20], or other complex motions [21, 22].|$|R

It is shown that in general there is no hydrostatic equilibrium. In place of equilibrium, there is a dynamical nonequilibrium, which leads to neutral point reconnection and progressive coalescence of neighboring tubes (with {{the same sense of}} twisting); this in turn forms tubes of large diameter and reduced twist. The magnetic energy in the twisting of each tube declines toward zero, being dissipated into small-scale motions of the fluid and thence into heat.
