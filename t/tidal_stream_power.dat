The kinetic energy from <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> can be used for generation of electrical power. The purpose of this study was to draw the mapping of extractable <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy resources in Sarawak coastline. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed and corresponding power densities were computed through empirical equations. The mapping of potential locations was made by weighting of different elements required for the selection of suitable sites. It was found from the study that only a single site of Pulau Triso at Batang Lupar fulfilled the criteria of the required <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed and the clearance of shallow-draft oceangoing vessels. Off Kuala Igan met only the clearance requirements of all types of oceangoing vessels and the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed were found to be lower than set limits.

40|$|Characterisation of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site before device {{deployment}} {{is important}} for the marine tidal industry, in order to optimise the device design and accurately predict its performance during operation. Understanding the short-term uctuations in <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> velocity, resulting from turbulence and wave-current interactions, is essential for proper evaluation of the transient performance of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbine. Several aerodynamic models have been proposed for the design of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbines and energy production calculation, most of which have proved to predict accurately mean quantities within the ow regime. Unfortunately, these models cannot accurately predict the instantaneous ow variation and resulting forces within the ow regime acting on <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> systems which is of central importance to the tidal energy industry. The reasons for this may not be unconnected to the signi cant differences between wind and tidal turbines. Given the uncertainties which exist in the assumptions of resource modelling and the need for an accurate energy capture assessment at a speci c site, accurate on-site measurements that can predict the ow velocity (and its directional component) at a given location, are needed. This thesis is devoted to characterisation of ow in a typical <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site (the Fall of Warness, of the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), Orkney) through measured data. The high-frequency Acoustic Doppler Current Pro ler (ADCP) surveys were conducted at different locations within this site by EMEC.

40|$|The Pentland Firth {{is arguably}} the best-known {{candidate}} site for <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>power</b> extraction worldwide. In this paper we estimate the maximum power that can be extracted by placing <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>power</b> devices across the Pentland Firth and/or the individual sub-channels formed by the islands of Swona, Stroma and the Pentland Skerries. Using a depth-averaged numerical model, for the entire Firth we find that approximately 4. 2 GW of power may be extracted, and this agrees reasonably well with predictions from an existing theoretical model. In contrast, for the sub-channels {{there is no single}} value to describe the power potential, but rather a range of power estimates because the extracted power from one sub-channel depends on the operation (or otherwise) of tidal devices placed in parallel sub-channels, or in series along the Firth. This range in output is of practical importance given present plans to lease separate sites within the Pentland to different device developers, and suggests that regulation of separate device developers will be crucial to achieve optimum performance across the entire Firth. Finally, we show that large scale energy extraction from the Pentland Firth does not lead to flow diversion around the Orkney Islands as a whole (as is sometimes assumed), however energy extraction in the Pentland Firth can augment the phase difference across smaller sub-channels in the Orkney Islands and this may increase their power potential. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Mapping the availability of these resources {{is an important step}} for development of energy conversion projects. For this purpose, the wave power potential along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern USA, and the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>power</b> along the coast of Georgia are investigated in this study. Wave power potential is studied in an area bounded by latitudes 27 N and 38 N and longitudes 82 W and 72 W (i. e. North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and northern Florida). The available data from National Data Buoy Center wave stations in the given area are examined. Power calculated from hourly significant wave heights and average wave periods is compared to power calculated using spectral wave energy density. The mean power within 50 km of the shore is determined to be low, whereas higher power is available further offshore beyond the 3500 m contour line. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>power</b> potential along the coast of the state of Georgia is evaluated based on the NOAA tidal predictions for maximum tidal currents and three dimensional numerical modeling of the currents with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The modeling results are validated against the available measurements.

The residual flow in the Fromveur Strait, separating Ushant island fromMoì ene archipelago, displays thus a strong asymmetry, between a prominent northeastern pathway with residual currents up to 0. 45 m s − 1 and a southward circulation. The positions of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic recirculations, both upstream and downstream the Strait, are furthermore precisely defined.

We motivate our study of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> by highlighting the tight constraints that analysis of the trajectories of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> can place on the form of the Galactic potential. We address the reconstruction of orbits from observations of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> We upgrade the scheme reported by Binney (2008) and Jin & Lynden-Bell (2007), which reconstructs orbits from streams using radial-velocity measurements, to allow it to work with erroneous input data. The upgraded algorithm can correct for both statistical error on observations, and systematic error due to streams not delineating individual orbits, and given high-quality but realistic input data, it can diagnose the potential with considerable accuracy. We complement the work of Binney (2008) by deriving a new algorithm, which reconstructs orbits from streams using proper-motion data rather than radial velocities. We show that the new algorithm has a similar potency for diagnosing the Galactic potential. We explore the concept of Galactic parallax, which arises in connection with our proper-motion study.

40|$|Tidal stream {{energy is}} one of the {{alternative}} energy sources that are renewable and clean. With the constantly increasing effort in promoting alternative energy, tidal streams have become one of the more promising energy sources due to their continuous, predictable and spatially-concentrated characteristics. However, the present lack of a full spatial-temporal assessment of tidal currents for the U. S. coastline down to the scale of individual devices is a barrier to the comprehensive development of tidal current energy technology. This project created a national database of tidal stream energy potential, as well as a GIS tool usable by industry in order to accelerate the market for tidal energy conversion technology. Tidal currents are numerically modeled with the Regional Ocean Modeling System and calibrated with the available measurements of tidal current speed and water level surface. The performance of the model in predicting the tidal currents and water levels is assessed with an independent validation. The geodatabase is published at a public domain via a spatial database engine and interactive tools to select, query and download the data are provided. Regions with the maximum of the average kinetic power density larger than 500 W/m 2 (corresponding to a current speed of ~ 1 m/s), surface area larger than 0. 5 km 2 and depth larger than 5 m are defined as hotspots and list of hotspots along the USA coast is documented.

In the model, the effect of tidal arrays is represented by line discontinuities where upstream and downstream heads are related by Linear Momentum Actuator Disk Theory. A parametric study to investigate the importance of array locations, the connectivity of the arrays and local blockage effects on the available power has been undertaken.

It is found that three rows of turbines extending across the entire width of the Pentland Firth and blocking a large fraction of the channel can theoretically generate 1. 9 GW, averaged over the spring-neap cycle. However, generation of significantlymore power than this is unlikely to be feasible as the available power per additional swept area of turbine is too small to be viable. Our results differ from those obtained using simplified tidal channelmodels of the type used commonly in the literature. We also use our numerical model to investigate the available power from rows of turbines placed across various subchannels within the Pentland Firth, together with practical considerations such as the variation in power over the spring-neap tidal cycle and the changes to natural tidal flows which result from power extraction. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The tidal current velocity is gotten by three dimensional numerical modeling. The tidal current model is validated by measurement of tidal current observed in 4 points surrounding ZTD. The numerical results {{given by the}} tidal current model already shows that: the tidal current velocities given by the model agree with the measured velocities generally. The characteristics of tidal currents around ZTD are analyzed and the following <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy density is calculated. The maximum <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy flux of unit width occurs around the middle locations of ZTD southern areas...|$|R

Currently, more than 25, 000 people (150, 000 since November 9, 2007) contribute about half a PetaFLOPS of computing power to our project. We currently run two types of applications: one application fits the spatial density profile of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> using statistical photometric parallax, and the other application finds the N-body simulation parameters that produce <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> that best match the measured density profile of known <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> The stream fitting application is well developed and is producing published results. The Sagittarius dwarf leading tidal tail has been fit, and the algorithm is currently running on the trailing tidal tail and bifurcated pieces. We will soon have a self-consistent model for the density of the smooth component of the stellar halo and the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> The $N$-body application has been implemented for fitting dwarf galaxy progenitor properties only, and is in the testing stages. We use an Earth-Mover Distance method to measure goodness-of-fit for density of stars along the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream.</b> We will add additional spatial dimensions as well as kinematic measures in a piecemeal fashion, with the eventual goal of fitting the orbit and parameters of the Milky Way potential (and thus the density distribution of dark matter) using multiple <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure; Setting the scene for Gaia and LAMOST, Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, IAU Symposium, Volume 298, pp. 98 - 104, 201...|$|R
