500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, {{we might be able to}} find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Menzel {{said that}} Arnold may have merely seen spots {{of water on}} his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's {{testimony}} that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the East Oregonian has Arnold saying he at first <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he was seeing reflections off his window, but [...] "he still saw the objects after rolling it down." ...|$|E

5000|$|Burnat {{was widely}} criticized in Ramallah {{for working with}} Israelis, and Davidi was made to feel that “I had not {{sufficiently}} proved myself. I <b>thought</b> to myself <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> we needed an Israeli activist to die {{in order to win}} credibility. Perhaps not enough Israeli blood has been spilled.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In February 2010, Rafael Nadal was {{featured}} in the music video of Shakira's [...] "Gypsy". and part of her album release She Wolf. In explaining why she chose Nadal for the video, Shakira {{was quoted as saying}} {{in an interview with the}} Latin American Herald Tribune: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> I needed someone I could in some way identify with. And Rafael Nadal is a person who has been totally committed to his career since he was very young. Since he was 17, I believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E

50|$|This 'Frontier Pushing' dive was {{directly}} responsible for the upsurge in Shark Tourism - esp free-diving (i.e. Out of cage) swimming with big sharks. When would be operators around the world became aware of these four mad people who proved that the Great White was quite approachable and not likely to attack - <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> then <b>maybe</b> all the other 'Bad Boy' sharks like Tigers, Bulls and Oceanic's were safe to swim with too. This {{proved to be the}} case and shark tourism has become a multi-million-dollar a year industry.|$|R

60|$|It {{did just}} occur to him <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> {{he had not}} made that descent quite as {{successfully}} as he had <b>thought</b> he had; <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he had come down on his head; that in consequence he had done with the experiences of Flight Commander Raffleton and was now about to enter on a new and less circumscribed existence. If so, the beginning, to an adventuresome young spirit, seemed promising. It was Malvina's voice that recalled him from this train of musing.|$|R
50|$|Editing {{plays a role}} in the {{electrophysiology}} of the channel.Editing at the Q/R {{site has}} been deemed to be nonessential in GluR-6. It has been reported that unedited version of Glu-R6 functions in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. The edited version is thought to inhibit synaptic plasticity and reduce seizure susceptibility.Mice lacking the Q/R site are capable of long term potentiation and are more susceptible to kainate induced seizures. The number of seizures inversely correlates with the amount of rna editing. This correlates to the increase in human GluR-6 pre-mRNA editing during seizures. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> editing <b>maybe</b> an adaptive mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The Marxist {{doctrine}} that religion would inevitably disappear was increasingly questioned and re-interpreted. A new interpretation held that religion was forced down upon people somehow through coercive tactics of believers. For example, in a supposedly true story {{printed in the}} press on the True Orthodox Christian Wanderers (an outlawed Old Believer sect) a monastic priest with a bony predatory nose, who was hiding from the law, wandered through the woods and came upon a group of sectarians who agree to hide him while assuring {{him that he could}} have a life without working. They then produce samizdat literature that breathes hatred against everything human and to the Soviet Union especially. A college student from the city of Novokuznetsk then met this priest and had a conversation with him, in which the student expressed some <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> there was something beyond this world. The priest then seized the opportunity and talked him into coming to a skete in Siberia. On the way, {{in the middle of the}} night, the priest grabbed the frightened student and forcibly baptized him. Then he ordered him to destroy his papers and passport, but not his money, which the priest took for himself. The article then concluded that all religious believers, who were reportedly properly characterized in this fashion, are malicious enemies of all living things.|$|R
60|$|Then in {{an instant}} the lights flashed out again, the music began to play and the people began to talk and laugh, and King Selim <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> all that had just passed was only {{a bit of an}} ugly dream after all.|$|E
6000|$|Then the hermit {{knew that}} some great trouble had befallen Sir Launcelot, and he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> if Sir Launcelot would eat he would perhaps be {{refreshed}} and might maybe recover his mind once more. So the good man said, [...] "Messire, will you not eat?" [...] and Sir Launcelot said, [...] "Yea, give me to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{but there}} is always the hope of escape or of exchange.

5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with OK! Magazine, actress Charlize Theron claimed {{that when she}} was 18 she was propositioned at an audition by a pajama-clad Hollywood director. [...] "I thought it was a little odd that the audition was on a Saturday night at his house in Los Angeles, but I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> was normal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other studio chiefs laughed, {{calling the}} place [...] "Laemmle's Folly" [...] and jeering {{that it was}} so far out of town that Laemmle could film scenery for free {{anywhere}} he wanted. Laemmle himself had second <b>thoughts</b> and worried <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he had made a huge mistake. But he was to soon live his greatest dreams. Success was found all around with his [...] "city" [...] containing streets, bungalows, sets and viewing stands [...] - [...] all so the public could observe the magic of moviemaking.|$|R
5000|$|Susan Sussman's 1983 children's book, There's No Such Thing as a Chanukah Bush, Sandy Goldstein, {{explores the}} {{difficulties}} felt, {{not only by}} Jewish families in a predominantly Christian society, but the sometimes sharper tensions between Jewish families that do {{and do not have}} holiday trees. In the story, a wise grandfather resolves the situation by taking Robin, the have-not child, to a Christmas party given by his union chapter - [...] a party he helped to organize. Thus, the book draws a distinction between sharing the Christmas holiday (which it approves) and observing it (which it questions). Robin's concluding <b>thought</b> is <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> her friend [...] "needed a Chanukah bush" [...] because she lacked [...] "friends who shared with you." [...] A television adaptation of the book won an Emmy award in 1998.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] {{said the}} ex-corporal, {{speaking}} in a whining voice, and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing, [...] "I'm an old gunner in the Queen's service, sir, and knowing your name by hearing it in India I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> you would take me as your groom or gardener, or give me any other place as happened to be vacant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram sings] So Gouvernail {{brought to}} Sir Tristram his shining harp, and when Sir Tristram {{had taken it}} into his hands he tuned it, {{and when he had}} tuned it he struck it and sang; and, because of the stillness of the evening, his voice sounded marvellously clear and sweet across the level water, so that those who stood upon the castle walls and heard it <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> an angel was singing on board of that ship.|$|E
60|$|I ran to {{the door}} to meet him, feeling that I would have given a deal to have him back in Edinburgh again. He came running, waving a paper over his head; and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he had a note from Edie, and that it was all known to him. But as he came up I saw that it was a big, stiff, yellow paper which {{crackled}} as he waved it, and that his eyes were dancing with happiness.|$|E
5000|$|In The Jungle Book 2, he is {{voiced by}} Bob Joles and reappears as the mature Bagheera. He tries {{to reason with}} a {{depressed}} Baloo that Mowgli's place is in the Man Village, and that the jungle is not safe for him because Shere Khan has returned to get revenge on Mowgli for humiliating him, but Baloo is certain that with their help, Mowgli can handle the tiger a second time, and bypasses Bagheera. Frustrated, he calls upon Colonel Hathi and his troops to block Baloo's path. When the villagers try to find Mowgli, he suspects that Baloo has brought him back; he confronts Baloo with the news and expresses his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he has seen him. Baloo hides Mowgli from Bagheera and convinces Bagheera {{that he is not}} with him, although Bagheera does not entirely believe it. He appears again later on, when Mowgli's younger adoptive brother Ranjan and Baloo are hurrying to save Mowgli from Shere Khan, and joins them. When they reach the temple built on a lava lake, Bagheera waits outside with Ranjan and warns Baloo to be careful before he goes inside to help Mowgli. After Shere Khan is trapped, Mowgli introduces Bagheera to Shanti, the girl who is Mowgli's best friend at the village. Near the end of the film, Ranjan is shown playing with Bagheera's tail. At first Bagheera is scared, but he later enjoys playing with him while Mowgli, Shanti, and Baloo sing the reprise of [...] "The Bare Necessities".|$|R
2500|$|Havins {{agreed with}} Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. [...] "I'm always {{up for a}} {{challenge}} and I work best under pressure," [...] she said. [...] "My competitive side kicks in. So the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I <b>maybe</b> couldn't do it made me be like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm doin' it!' We put so much preparation into it." [...] Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. [...] "...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We {{put a lot of}} time into this episode," [...] Havins stated. [...] "We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal." [...] She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. [...] "And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We were all there, we were all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sweeney has said, [...] "I'd been an {{accountant}} for like five years, {{and there was}} one person I worked with in particular who had a lot of mannerisms like Pat. This person sort of drooled and had the kind of body language of Pat. I started trying to do him. I was testing it out on my friends and they were just like, 'Yeah, it's good, but it doesn't seem like a guy that much.' Like I couldn't quite pull off being in drag convincingly enough. So then I <b>thought,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>thats</b> the joke. I'll just have one joke in here about how we don't know if that's {{a man or a woman}} just to sort of cover up for my lack of ability to really play a guy convincingly." ...|$|R

It contained nothing but many shining instruments, but the only one that we knew the purport of was a saw. There were two boxes of the same shape, and the other contained a number of little bottles of drugs; and we <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe,</b> as the boxes were alike, these shining instruments were used by the white hakim.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, that's true, sir," [...] he said; [...] "though how {{you come}} to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got {{up to the door}} it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with me. I ain't afeared of {{anything}} on this side o' the grave; but I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him.

50|$|Blessed Theodosius, Wondermaker from Kyiv {{was baptized}} and was sung by Christian Orthodox rite. He was upbrought in and well {{informed}} about Christian Orthodox religious tradition of his forefathers, Cossacks-Christians {{from the banks}} of Dnipro river, tradition of free Ukraine and saint Rus and evidently he had his own, very special relations with God. But problem is that different people, who knew him very well interpret differently his heritage and worldview, his relations with God The Christ and with Orthodox Church and other religions {{according to their own}} worldview. It is well-known that blessed Theodosius had a lot of friends with very different and specific worldviews (Orthodox, Greek and Roman Catholic Christians, adepts of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Thaoism, Atheism etc.) and had good word for everybody so many people <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he is <b>maybe</b> of their own religion.
