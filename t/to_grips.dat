5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, crushing the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had come <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|More {{disturbing}} to Lord Howe were {{the actions of}} HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of}} the line.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{series of}} the British comedy drama {{television}} series Cold Feet was broadcast on the ITV network from 23 February to 16 March 2003. This was the final {{series of the}} drama and {{while the number of}} episodes was halved compared to the previous series, the running time was increased from 46 minutes to 72 minutes per episode, necessitating a 95-minute timeslot. The plot of the series follows three couples: Adam (James Nesbitt) and Rachel (Helen Baxendale) getting <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with bringing up baby Matthew (born in the final episode of the previous series), the return of Pete (John Thomson) and Jo (Kimberley Joseph) from their honeymoon, and the subsequent breakdown of their marriage, and the divorce proceedings between Karen (Hermione Norris) and David (Robert Bathurst).|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} to come <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt}} to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or come <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E
