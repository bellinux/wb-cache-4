40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a thermal design approach to increase thermal control system performance and decrease reliance on system resources, e. g., mass. Thermal design optimization has lagged other subsystems because the thermal subsystem is not thought to significantly drive performance or resource consumption. However, there are factors present in many spacecraft systems that invalidate this assumption. Traditional thermal design methods include point designs where experts make key component selection and sizing decisions. Thermal design optimization literature primarily focuses on optimization {{of the components}} in isolation {{from other parts of}} the thermal control system, restricting the design space considered. The collective thermal design optimization process formulates the <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> design process as an optimization problem where the design variables are updated for each candidate design. Parametric model(s) within the optimizer predict the performance and properties of candidate designs. The <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> parameterization captures the component interactions with each other, the system, and the space environment, and is critical to preserving the full design space. The optimal design is a <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> with higher performance and decreased resource consumption compared to traditional thermal design methods. The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) payload instrument serves as a case study to demonstrate the collective thermal design optimization process. First, a preliminary thermal control system model of a point design is used to determine the critical <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> within REXIS: the thermal strap and radiator assembly. The collective thermal design optimization process is implemented on the thermal strap and radiator <b>thermal</b> <b>path.</b> Mass minimization is the objective and the REXIS detector operational temperature is a constraint to the optimization. This approach offers a 37 % reduction in mass of the thermal strap and radiator assembly over a component-level optimization method. by Kevin Dale Stout. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A micro {{heat flux}} sensor which can measure the thermal energy {{transfer}} {{per unit area}} has been designed, fabricated, and calibrated in a convective environment. The sensor {{which is based on}} a circular foil gage is composed of <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> and a thermopile. The thermal path is made in a LIGA-like process of SU- 8 high aspect ratio microstructures and electroplated copper layers. The thermopile, a series of thermocouples, is used to amplify the output signal as a thermometer. When the sensor is placed on a high-temperature wall, heat flux from the wall flows through <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> and drains out to the environment, producing a temperature difference along its paths. Heat flux is obtained by calibrating this temperature difference in the thermopile of Ni–Cr or Al–Chromel pairs.

40|$|Knowledge of {{instantaneous}} {{junction temperature}} {{is essential for}} effective health management of power converters, enabling safe operation of the power semiconductors under all operating conditions. Methods based on fixed thermal models are typically unable to compensate for degradation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> resulting from aging {{and the effect of}} variable cooling conditions. Thermosensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs), on the other hand, can give an estimate of junction temperature TJ, but measurement inaccuracies and the masking effect of varying operating conditions can corrupt the estimate. This paper presents a robust and noninvasive real-time estimate of junction temperature that can provide enhanced accuracy under all operating and cooling conditions when compared to model-based or TSEP-based methods alone. The proposed method uses a Kalman filter to fuse the advantages of model-based estimates and an online measurement of TSEPs. Junction temperature measurements are obtained from an online measurement of the on-state voltage, VCE(ON), at high current and processed by a Kalman filter, which implements a predict-correct mechanism to generate an adaptive estimate of TJ. It is shown that the residual signal from the Kalman filter may be used to detect changes in thermal model parameters, thus allowing the assessment of <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> degradation.

The correlation is unexpected in its universality and unfavorable in its consequences for applications in DTE and ODTE. A standard model suggests that conduction by carriers of both signs occurs in these polymers, which thus leads to reduced thermoelectric efficiency.

40|$|Abstract Thermal {{cracking}} of kerogens and bitumens {{is widely}} accepted {{as the major}} source of natural gas (thermal gas). Decomposition is believed to occur at high temperatures, between 100 and 200 °C in the subsurface and generally above 300 °C in the laboratory. Although there are examples of gas deposits possibly generated at lower temperatures, and reports of gas generation {{over long periods of time}} at 100 °C, robust gas generation below 100 °C under ordinary laboratory conditions is unprecedented. Here we report gas generation under anoxic helium flow at temperatures 300 ° below thermal cracking temperatures. Gas is generated discontinuously, in distinct aperiodic episodes of near equal intensity. In one three-hour episode at 50 °C, six percent of the hydrocarbons (kerogen & bitumen) in a Mississippian marine shale decomposed to gas (C 1 –C 5). The same shale generated 72 % less gas with helium flow containing 10 ppm O 2 and the two gases were compositionally distinct. In sequential isothermal heating cycles (~ 1 hour), nearly five times more gas was generated at 50 °C (57. 4 μg C 1 –C 5 /g rock) than at 350 °C by thermal cracking (12 μg C 1 –C 5 /g rock). The position that natural gas forms only at high temperatures over geologic time is based largely on pyrolysis experiments under oxic conditions and temperatures where low-temperature gas generation could be suppressed. Our results indicate two paths to gas, a high-temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>path,</b> and a low-temperature catalytic path proceeding 300 ° below the <b>thermal</b> <b>path.</b> It redefines the time-temperature dimensions of gas habitats and opens the possibility of gas generation at subsurface temperatures previously thought impossible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in essence is {{the transport of}} thermal energy along certain paths {{in a similar way}} as fluid motion is the transport of fluid parcels along fluid paths. This similarity admits Lagrangian heat-transfer analyses by the geometry of such 2 ̆ 2 <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> 2 ̆ 2 analogous to well-known Lagrangian mixing analyses. Essential to Lagrangian heat-transfer formalisms is the reference state for the convective flux. Existing approaches admit only uniform references. However, for convective heat transfer, a case of great practical relevance, the conductive state that sets in for vanishing fluid motion is the more natural reference. This typically is an inhomogeneous state and thus beyond the existing formalism. The present study closes this gap by its generalisation to non-uniform references and thus substantially strengthens Lagrangian methods for thermal analyses. This ansatz is demonstrated by way of a 2 D case study and offers new fundamental insight into thermal transport that is complementary to the Eulerian picture based on temperature and heat-transfer coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{increased}} {{component density}} of a 3 D System-On-Package (SOP) exacerbates the thermal hotspot problem. A popular choice {{to mitigate the}} thermal issues is thermal vias (t-vias) {{that are used to}} establish <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> from the core of an SOP package to the heat sinks. Another major problem with SOP integration is the power supply noise coupling among various mixed signal components constituting the system. In this case, decoupling capacitors (decaps) are inserted to provide the switching currents locally. The goal of our automatic 3 D SOP component placement algorithm is to determine the x/y/z location of each component while minimizing the footprint area under thermal and power supply noise constraints. In general, t-vias and decaps are typically inserted in the white space in the placement, whereas the proximity of the t-vias and decaps to the target components determines their effectiveness. Hence, our component placer considers t-via and decap insertion during the early design stage, where the component location can be flexibly changed. Related experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. I...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in fluid flows traditionally is examined {{in terms of}} temperature field and heat-transfer coefficients at non-adiabatic walls. However, heat transfer may alternatively be considered as the transport of thermal energy by the total convective-conductive heat flux in a way analogous to the transport of fluid by the flow field. The paths followed by the total heat flux are the thermal counterpart to fluid trajectories and facilitate heat-transfer visualisation {{in a similar manner}} as flow visualisation. To date this concept has been restricted to 2 D steady flows. The present study proposes a generalisation of this concept to 3 D unsteady flows by considering the heat transfer as the 3 D unsteady motion of a virtual fluid subject to continuity. This ansatz is particularly suited for laminar flows, where flow and <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> are well-defined, and has great potential for heat-transfer problems in which insight into the heat fluxes throughout the entire configuration is essential (e. g. conjugate heat transfer, heat exchangers, cooling applications).
