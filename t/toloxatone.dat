50|$|The older MAOIs' heyday {{was mostly}} between the years 1957 and 1970. The initial {{popularity}} of the 'classic' non-selective irreversible MAO inhibitors began to wane due to their serious interactions with sympathomimetic drugs and tyramine-containing foods {{that could lead to}} dangerous hypertensive emergencies. As a result, the use by medical practitioners of these older MAOIs declined. When scientists discovered that there are two different MAO enzymes (MAO-A and MAO-B), they developed selective compounds for MAO-B, (for example, selegiline, which is used for Parkinson's disease), to reduce the side-effects and serious interactions. Further improvement occurred with the development of compounds (moclobemide and <b>toloxatone)</b> that not only are selective but cause reversible MAO-A inhibition and a reduction in dietary and drug interactions. Moclobemide, was the first reversible inhibitor of MAO-A to enter widespread clinical practice.|$|E

Moreover, this highly efficient catalyst system has been successfully demonstrated to one-step synthesis of <b>toloxatone</b> and a shorter route to formal synthesis of linezolid in good yields...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the two forms of MAO had led to significant advances {{in the understanding of}} the physiological and biochemical roles that these enzymes play in normal processes and in disease states. The recent development {{of a new generation of}} highly selective reversible MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) have led to a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of these new compounds with respect to early irreversible MAOIs. In fact, reversible MAOIs offer new hopes for generating superior anti-depressant and anti-parkinsonian agents by virtue of the selective inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. Aryloxazolidinones are one of the relatively new classes of MAOIs. Their “lead compound” is <b>Toloxatone</b> (Humoryl®), the first reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitor introduced in clinical practice as an anti-depressant. In order to investigate the importance and hence the biological role played by the anisyl (p-methoxyphenyl) group linked to N 3 atom of <b>Toloxatone</b> oxazolidinone ring or more in general of an aromatic group, some new N 3 -alkyloxazolidinones were synthesized and their ability to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes was evaluated by a fluorimetric method that uses the kynuramine as substrate. Also modifications at C 5 of the 2 -oxazolidinone ring were considered. The set of N 3 - alkyl substituted and at C 5 modified compounds showed ability to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B but with lower extent than <b>Toloxatone</b> used as reference drug. Such biological results provide insights into structure-activity relationships, confirming that is necessary the presence of N 3 -aryl moiety to act as a potent reversible MAO inhibitor, not possible in the same extent when the aryl is replaced by an alkyl group (Ki≈ 10 - 7 M versus 10 - 3 – 10 - 4 M) ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{series of}} 5 -substituted- 3 -(1 H-pyrrol- 2 -yl) - 2 -oxazolidinones 2 a-s has been {{described}} as pyrrole analogues of <b>toloxatone</b> and befloxatone, two phenyl-oxazolidinones active as anti-MAO agents and used in antidepressant therapy. Tested against MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes, the majority of 2 a-s show highly potent inhibitory effect against the A isoform of the enzyme, with Ki values in the range 0. 52 - 0. 004 μM, whilst their anti-MAO-B activity is considerably lower (Ki = > 100 - 0. 5 μM). Structurally, 2 a-s differs for the substituent inserted at the C 5 position of the 2 - oxazolidinone ring (hydroxymethyl (2 a-d), methoxymethyl (2 e-h), azidomethyl (2 i-l), methylaminomethyl (2 m-p), and aminomethyl (2 q-s)), {{and the size of the}} alkyl chain at the pyrrole N 1 position (methyl, ethyl, allyl, or benzyl). As a rule, apart from the C 5 substitution, the bulkier is the alkyl group at the pyrrole-N 1, the lower is the anti-MAO-A activity of the compounds, being the N 1 -methyl derivatives 2 a, 2 e, 2 i, and 2 q among the most potent (KiMAO-A = 0. 087 - 0. 004 μM) and A-selective (A-selectivity ratio: > 11, 111 - 41) compounds in this series. Exceptions are represented by the N 1 -benzyl derivative 2 d (KiMAO-A = 0. 009 μM) and the N 1 -allylpyrrole 2 o (KiMAO-A = 0. 04 μM). In comparison with the reference drugs, these highly active derivatives are more potent than <b>toloxatone,</b> slightly less potent than befloxatone, and several times more A-selective than both the references. Such results indicate that 2 a-s may represent a new promising series of antidepressant agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis outlines work {{carried out}} {{during the past three}} years for the discovery and investigation of catalytic methodologies towards the synthesis and modification of heterocycles, namely cyclic carbamates, carbonates and their sulfur analogues. Chapter 1 summarises the current catalytic methods reported in the literature towards the synthesis and modification of functionalized 2 -oxazolidinones. This introduction highlights the diverse range of methods and catalysts that have been developed and their scope and limitations. In addition the review highlights the importance of these structural motifs and suggests areas in which the following research fulfills unmet needs. Chapter 2 reports the discovery and development of a one-pot two-step copper-catalysed methodology towards the synthesis of N-aryl oxazolidinones from amino alcohol carbamates. The scope of both the N-aryl substituent as well as oxazolidinone functionalization is presented in addition to preliminary investigations into the mechanisms of both reactions. Chapter 3 presents the application of the previously reported one-pot process towards the synthesis of a number of medicinally active molecules and blockbuster pharmaceuticals. The one-pot two-step copper-catalysed reaction was utilized to synthesise a common intermediate in the synthesis of a number of oxazolidinone-based pharmaceuticals. The complete syntheses of <b>Toloxatone,</b> Linezolid, Tedizolid and Rivaroxaban are reported. Chapter 4 reports the modification of N-aryl oxazolidinones towards a diverse library of N-aryl oxazolidinethiones. The reactivity of these structures, in addition to N-alkyl oxazolidinethiones, towards transition metal catalysis was investigated and revealed a ruthenium catalysed O- to S-alkyl migration to afford structurally diverse thiazolidinones. Investigations into the substrate scope and mechanism were also carried out, suggesting a pseudo-reversible radical pathway drawing mechanistic parallels to the classic Barton-McCombie reaction. Chapter 5 details further development of the pseudo-reversible radical pathway for the regioselective rearrangement of dioxolane- 2 -thiones using Pd(PPh 3) 4 as a catalyst. The scope of the reaction is reported for the formation of highly selective, highly substituted sulfur-rearrangement products...|$|E
