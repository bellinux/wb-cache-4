5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E

5|$|The one Germanic-language {{speaking}} {{country that}} {{was not included in}} the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the United Kingdom, in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. Günther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries. Günther referred to this historical process as Aufnordung ("additional nordification"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the survival of <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.|$|E

At the next show, Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second time, and then lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival of <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. Between that and their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is likely that a feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} is commonly equated with survival of <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer's Principles of Biology in 1864, {{five years after}} Charles Darwin published his original works.

50|$|If G is {{a finite}} {{solvable}} group, then <b>the</b> <b>Fitting</b> subgroup contains its own centralizer.

25|$|For many, {{the name}} of Herbert Spencer would be {{virtually}} synonymous with Social Darwinism, a social theory that applies {{the law of the}} survival of <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> to society; humanitarian impulses had to be resisted as nothing should be allowed to interfere with nature's laws, including the social struggle for existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} theory proposed by Darwin states that only <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> will survive and by lying, {{we aim to}} improve other's perception of our social image and status, capability, and desirability in general.

Scientific studies have also shown the presence of gender differences in lying.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{discrimination}} between the $Wt$ channel signal and its backgrounds for analyses that try to measure single top-quark production in the $Wt$ channel, a kinematic <b>fit</b> to <b>the</b> lepton+jets decay mode of the $Wt$ channel has been implemented using the KLFitter package. <b>The</b> <b>fit</b> has been validated by studying its performance {{in terms of the}} efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> to correctly assign the final-state quarks of <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> model to <b>the</b> measured jets as a function of various parameters, as well as the improvement of the energy resolutions of <b>the</b> <b>fitted</b> particles due to <b>the</b> <b>fit.</b> By combining <b>the</b> output variables of <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fitter</b> using neural networks, {{it has been shown that}} <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> results are suitable to identify the decay mode of the top quark in $Wt$ events and to identify whether <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fit</b> succeeded in correctly assigning the final-state quarks to the measured jets. In order to demonstrate the value of <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fit</b> for analysis, another neural network - again using strictly results of <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fit</b> as input - has been trained to separate to the $Wt$ channel signal from its backgrounds.
