6000|$|... 'Have you {{anything}} going to Knollsea this morning <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a lift in?' said the pedestrian--no other than Ethelberta's father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there a steamer or {{a vessel}} {{of any kind}} leaving this coast to-night or to-morrow <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> passage on?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come now, <b>that's</b> nonsense. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up {{as early}} as anybody else. I have changed all {{that for the last}} four months. I was at breakfast this morning very soon after ten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ropes are dangerous," [...] {{replied the}} Ork, [...] "and I {{might not be}} able to find one to reach all this distance. Besides, it stands to reason <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out myself <b>I</b> <b>can</b> also carry you two with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} all right. I {{wonder what}} on earth the men do to the boots, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>get</b> a pair that do not hurt me in walking." [...] At this moment she was {{standing}} over him with his slippers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Iâ€™ll {{call out}} when I reach the water," [...] said Benson; [...] "then pay out three yards more quickly so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll wager a big tomato {{against a}} peck of clams <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up a better show myself, {{and do it}} blindfolded, too," [...] {{returned}} Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he declared; [...] "I feel ever so {{much more}} {{confident}} now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that seed. The {{fact that it was}} offered somehow encouraged me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, {{that you}} are coming, Uncle. You may be sure <b>that,</b> {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away from my duties with the general, I shall {{spend most of my}} time in your camp, though I must occasionally drop in on my own regiment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just what I say. He won't {{talk about}} the thing. He won't discuss it. He won't answer any {{question}} which I put to him. 'My dear boy, {{the man is a}} palpable, impudent impostor, a blackmailer' and <b>that's</b> all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{when he is}} {{not with}} me, or when people force me to. If he is in the room, I am so nervous <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>get</b> through the easiest song. He never offers to {{accompany}} me now, and generally leaves the room when I am asked to sing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up," [...] {{he cried}} out, [...] "but I {{should like to}} help myself with the rope. Can you both hold it tightly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter Rabbit, I {{want to go}} home," [...] said Johnny Chuck suddenly. [...] "Isn't there a {{short cut}} so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> home before my mother does?" ...|$|E

6000|$|ICH. [...] "'Your Majesty's pardon! She {{cultivated}} well, but {{a heap of}} mischances {{brought her}} down: those may happen to the best husbandman. I myself, two years ago, lost so many cattle by the murrain, and got no remission: since <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on again either.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, my friend. If {{there were}} any {{question}} of my return we would reverse the offices. But I think <b>I</b> may say <b>that</b> my mind is fixed. If you wish it I will see Mr. Monk, and do all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to <b>get</b> him to go with you. But for myself,--I feel {{that it would be}} useless." ...|$|R
60|$|Thank my dear Mrs. Fields {{for me for}} her {{delightful}} letter {{received on}} the 16th. I will write to her very soon, and {{tell her about the}} dogs. I would write by this post, but that Wills' absence (in Sussex, and getting no better there as yet) so overwhelms me with business <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarcely <b>get</b> through it.|$|R
6000|$|Now the New Year, {{reviving}} last Year's Debt, The Thoughtful Fisher casteth wide his Net; [...] So I with begging Dish {{and ready}} Tongue Assail all Men for all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't think it's <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> fond as the deuce {{of some of}} the commonest common soldiers--and, Lord! some of {{them come}} from the Bowery and all sorts of {{impossible}} places." ...|$|E
50|$|Oh my heart, won't {{believe that}} you have left me I keep telling myself <b>that</b> it's true <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> over anything, you want my love But i can't get myself over you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think--if I am {{ever to be}} what <b>I</b> wish, <b>that</b> is, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{through at}} Oxford--I don't {{think it can be}} wrong to begin this, if Mr. Ramsden does not object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} this,--that you have betrayed me; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall tell him {{so in the}} plainest words <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use. To <b>get</b> his lawyer to write and offer me money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll be {{more popular}} now that he's {{the heir to}} Tretton. I don't know any fellow <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> along better with than Scarborough. I think {{you were a little}} hard upon him about his father, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{see it in}} that light," [...] Jake {{replied in}} his old obstinate manner. [...] "Perhaps Poyor has had more {{experience}} in these woods than I have; but I'll bet considerable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> around {{as well as he}} does." ...|$|E
6000|$|If Aunt Rebecca {{had shown}} any regret {{at the thought}} of Jane Lavinia's departure, Jane Lavinia would have foregone New York on the spot. But Aunt Rebecca only said coldly, [...] "I guess you needn't worry over <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> along well enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're all right, old man, {{even if you}} do {{look like}} a pirate. If you can manage to capture <b>that</b> city, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> my {{electrical}} devices back, I'll consider you a trump as long as I live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In troth, Signior Guest," [...] said Giles Gosling, [...] "if I were {{to travel}} only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might be discontented with <b>that</b> which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> at home, methinks I should go {{but on a}} fool's errand. Besides, I warrant you, there is many a fool can turn his nose up at good drink without ever having {{been out of the}} smoke of Old England; and so ever gramercy mine own fireside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's for fortune, if that's {{what you}} call it," [...] said Richard bluntly. [...] "I'm tired of Mossvale, and I'm going to strike out, <b>that</b> is if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> consent. I've spoken to mother about it already, and if--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kemp {{stood in}} the middle of the room staring at the {{headless}} garment. [...] "I suppose I must leave you," [...] he said. [...] "It's--incredible.

6000|$|... "Chuck it!" [...] Dredlinton interrupted. [...] "You're {{a man of}} the world. You {{know very}} well <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a divorce, and I'm going to have it--if I want it. I am meeting Flossie Lane at midday at my solicitor's. What have you got to say about that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' {{cried the}} old woman, in a rage. 'Do you care {{more for a}} miserable mouse than for your own baby? Good-bye, madam! I leave you to enjoy its company, and for my own part I thank my stars <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> plenty of mice without troubling you to give them to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly! Certainly! It {{never does}} {{to talk to}} Tringle about {{business}} at his own house. I'll make an hour {{to see him in}} the City to-morrow. I'm so pressed by business <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>get</b> away from the House after twelve;--but, I'll do it. But, while I'm in Lombard Street, do you go to Queen's Gate." [...] The Captain after further consideration said that he would go to Queen's Gate.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked if}} he felt that Powell should be fired, Moats said, [...] "I really don't know. All I know is {{what he did was}} wrong. I mean, he stole a moment away from me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>get</b> back. I'm really not the judge on what should happen to him. I think maybe his {{superiors}} and the Dallas police should handle what should happen to him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I will NEVER let {{up in my}} {{battle against}} the LEFT.
