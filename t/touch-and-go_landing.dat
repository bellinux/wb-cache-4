40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{non-linear}} methodologies {{that can be}} employed to devise real-time algorithms suitable for guidance and control of spacecrafts during asteroid close-proximity operations. Combination of optimal and sliding control theory provide the theoretical framework {{for the development of}} guidance laws that generates thrust commands as function of the estimated spacecraft state. Using a Lyapunov second theorem one can design non-linear guidance laws that are proven to be globally stable against unknown perturbations with known upper bound. Such algorithms can be employed for autonomous targeting of points of the asteroid surface (soft <b>landing,</b> <b>Touch-And-Go</b> (TAG) maneuvers). Here, we theoretically derived and tested the Optimal Sliding Guidance (OSG) for close-proximity operations. The guidance algorithm has its root in the generalized ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance and its mathematical equations are naturally derived by a proper definition of a sliding surface as function of Zero-Effort-Miss and Zero-Effort-Velocity. Thus, the sliding surface allows a natural augmentation of the energy-optimalguidance via a sliding mode that ensures global stability for the proposed algorithm. A set of Monte Carlo simulations in realistic environment are executed to assess the guidance performance in typical operational scenarios found during asteroids close-proximity operations. OSG is shown to satisfy stringent requirements for asteroid pinpoint landing and sampling accuracy...|$|R

50|$|In aviation, a <b>touch-and-go</b> <b>landing</b> (TGL) {{or circuit}} is a {{maneuver}} that is common when learning {{to fly a}} fixed-wing aircraft.

After a [...] <b>touch-and-go</b> <b>landing</b> on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
50|$|On July 8, 2009, {{the city}} council decided on a phased closure of the airport. In September, {{the city council}} {{postponed}} {{the closure of the}} north-south runway until after the Indy and Airfest events of 2010. On August 3, 2010, runway 16/34 was closed to air traffic with a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) being issued at 3 am that morning. Current licenses for scheduled air service were not renewed. Closure of the remaining runway was announced at an Edmonton City Council meeting on September 26, 2013. The last airplane to leave the airfield was a Cessna 172, owned and piloted by a local, on the afternoon of November 30, 2013. Weather prevented a pair of CF-18 fighter jets from performing a <b>touch-and-go</b> <b>landing</b> as the ceremonial last takeoff. Shortly afterwards, ERAA placed barricades on the remaining runway 12/30 to prevent access and it was clearly marked to signal to pilots that it is closed. The museum and some non-aviation institutions will remain. Some land will be transferred to NAIT, and the rest will be converted to a primarily residential development.|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{government}} purchased 142 acres of farmland in 1941 {{to build an}} outlying airfield supporting operations at Naval Air Station Alameda. A 4,000-foot asphalt-paved runway was oriented 070-250 and crossed at its midpoint by a second 3,800-foot asphalt runway oriented 130-310. Each runway had a parallel taxiway, and a third taxiway connected the easterly ends of the two runways to an intermediate concrete apron. An additional 75 acres acquired in June, 1943, allowed construction of an operations building with a two-story control tower, a fire and crash truck garage, two gasoline storage tanks, an oil storage building, a small arms ammunition magazine, a well for the airfield water supply, and a backstop used for small arms practice and aircraft machinegun collimation. [...] Simultaneous development of NALF Santa Rosa was more extensive because poor site drainage caused periodic flooding of the Cotati field. <b>Touch-and-go</b> <b>landing</b> practice became the primary activity at the Cotati satellite airfield of the Santa Rosa Auxiliary Naval Air Station. Runway damage from 1945 flooding terminated military flight operations at Cotati despite continuing use of NALF Santa Rosa.|$|E
5000|$|A {{first attempt}} to attack the British fleet was made on 2 May 1982, but this was {{abandoned}} due to flight-refuelling problems. On 4 May, two Super Étendards, guided by a Lockheed P-2H Neptune, each launched one Exocet at the British destroyer , with one missile crippling Sheffield. On 25 May, another attack by two Super Étendards resulted in two missiles hitting the merchant ship , which was carrying several helicopters and various other supplies to the front line. The Exocets that struck Atlantic Conveyor had been inadvertently redirected by decoy chaff deployed as a defensive measure by other ships; Sheffield was scuttled and Atlantic Conveyor sunk {{as a result of}} the Exocet strikes.Following the end of the conflict, by 1984 Argentina had been able to complete the delivery of the full 14 Super Étendards ordered as well as Exocets with which to arm them. Super Étendards performed qualifications on aircraft carrier ARA 25 de Mayo until the ship's final retirement.

5000|$|For {{the crash}} {{sequence}} {{at the start}} of the movie, a rebadged Aer Lingus Boeing 747 performed a <b>touch-and-go</b> <b>landing</b> at RAF Machrihanish. The plane crash sequence was filmed at Campbeltown Airport on the south-west coast of Scotland, mainly due to its remoteness and that the runway is around 1.7 mi long. Usually, at a time when movies would use models to crash-land an aircraft as expensive as a Boeing 747, the production team purchased an older Boeing 707 from South America. The aircraft was built as ZS-CKC (SN: 17928) for South African Airways in July 1960 and retired with SAA in 1977. Its final registration was N90651, operated by PWA: Panama World Airways and finally retired in 1981. [...] Purchased by Columbia Pictures in Sept 1984, it was converted with the famous 747 hump, a painted cockpit and a small vision slit on the original cockpit, so the stunt pilots could perform the live action crash-landing. Due to the size differences, forced perspective was used to give the impression of a larger aircraft and short actors used in a brief sequence where a vehicle is almost hit. The film contains an early-career performance by Maryam d'Abo, later to star as a Bond girl in the James Bond film The Living Daylights.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{flight control}} systems are popular for their flexibility, reliability, and power; however, their use {{sometimes}} results in deficient handling qualities, including pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), which can require extensive redesign {{of the control}} system. When redesign is not immediately possible, temporary solutions, such as the PIO suppression (PIOS) filter developed for the Space Shuttle, have been proposed. To determine the effectiveness of such PIOS filters on more conventional, high-performance aircraft, three experiments were performed using the NASA F- 8 digital fly-by-wire and USAF/Calspan NT- 33 variable-stability aircraft. Two types of PIOS filters were evaluated, using high-gain, precision tasks (close formation, probe-and-drogue refueling, and precision <b>touch-and-go</b> <b>landing)</b> with a time delay or a first-order lag added to make the aircraft prone to PIO. Various configurations of the PIOS filter were evaluated in the flight programs, {{and most of the}} PIOS filter configurations reduced the occurrence of PIOs and improved the handling qualities of the PIO-prone aircraft. These experiments also confirmed the influence of high-gain tasks and excessive control system time delay in evoking pilot-induced oscillations...|$|E
