40|$|The {{effect of}} coating {{thickness}} and roughness on water-repellency and thermally induced voids/cracks in copper-coated optical fibers is investigated. Seven samples of copper-coated optical fibers with identical fiber length but different coating thicknesses were prepared using electroless plating. <b>The</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of copper coatings were 62, 89, 127, 154, 165, 206, and 25 1 nm, respectively. Atomic force microscope measurement {{reveals that the}} roughness of copper coating increases when increasing <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness.</b> It is found that if <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness</b> is less than 89 nm, the water contact angle slightly increases with increasing <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness,</b> while fewer thermally induced voids/cracks are found in copper coatings. If <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness</b> is in <b>the</b> range of 89 to 25 1 nm, the water contact angle decreases when increasing <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness,</b> while <b>the</b> number of thermally induced voids/cracks increases when increasing <b>the</b> coating <b>thickness.</b> To get copper-coated optical fibers with high water-repellency and few thermally induced voids/cracks, the surface roughness of copper coatings should be diminished...|$|R
