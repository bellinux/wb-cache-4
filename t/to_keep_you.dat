They worked on four songs together, including the ballad [...] "If I Should Die Tonight", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. [...] "Just <b>to</b> <b>Keep</b> <b>You</b> Satisfied" [...] was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love.

500|$|Despite the praise, Patrick Joynt of 1UP.com {{criticized the}} conversations between in-game NPCs and the player: [...] "When an NPC greets {{you with a}} custom piece of {{dialogue}} (such as a guard's warning) and then reverts to the standard options (like a guard's cheerful directions just after that warning) it's more jarring than the canned dialogue by itself". GameSpy's Justin Speer criticized the [...] "disruptive loading stutters while moving across the game world" [...] and long loading times. Speer noted several miscellaneous bugs, such as unintended floating objects and unsynchronized lip-synching and speech. Onyett of IGN criticized the disjunction between enemies that scaled up according to the player's level and not their combat abilities or NPC allies, the loading times and the imprecision in the combat system, but stated that [...] "none of those minor criticisms hold back Oblivion from being a thoroughly enjoyable, user-friendly, gorgeous experience with enough content <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> returning time and time again".|$|E

[...] Sander noted Moore's contribution, saying that [...] "at times there's more technology and electronics than in the average house release." [...] Bollenberg noted that Moore's keyboards added [...] "textures flirting with semi-industrial patches and often being closer to Nine Inch Nails than 'vintage' melodic prog." [...] Hash praised Moore's vocals, noting they [...] "fit in well {{with all of the}} instrumental textures".

In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D.
