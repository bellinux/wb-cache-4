50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders. These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> girders on each side. The <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|R

30|$|The load–displacement curves were {{identical}} for the 2 D and 3 D specimens up to a vertical displacement of 18  mm. Because the flexural and arching {{actions of the}} in-plane beams are dominant during this stage, this similarity is obvious.

Generally, owing to the lack of axial restraint in the transverse beam, arching actions could not develop. Hence, flexural action is the dominant mechanism in the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame.</b> The flexural capacity of a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> leads to higher resistance for 3 D specimen events – in the post peak phase of the load–displacement curve (Fig.  11).

40|$|This book {{addresses}} {{various aspects}} of ship construction, from ship types and construction materials, to welding technologies and accuracy control. The contents of the book are logically organized and divided into twenty-one chapters. The book covers structural arrangement with longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>framing</b> systems based on the service load, and explains basic structural elements like hatch side girders, hatch end beams, stringers, etc. along with structural subassemblies like floors, bulkheads, inner bottom, decks and shells. It presents in detail double bottom construction, wing tanks & duct keels, fore & aft end structures, etc., together with necessary illustrations. The midship sections of various ship types are introduced, together with structural continuity and alignment in ship structures. With regard to construction materials, the book discusses steel, aluminum alloys and fiber reinforced composites. Various methods of steel material preparation are discussed, and plate cutting and forming of plates and sections are explained. The concept of line heating for plate bending is introduced. Welding power source characteristics, metal transfer mechanisms, welding parameters and their effects on the fusion zone, weld deposit, and weld bead profile are discussed in detail. Various fusion welding methods, MMAW, GMAW, SAW, Electroslag welding and Electrogas welding and single side welding are explained in detail. Friction stir welding {{as one of the}} key methods of solid state welding as applied to aluminum alloys is also addressed. The mechanisms of residual stress formation and distortion are explained in connection with stiffened panel fabrication, with an emphasis on weld induced buckling of thin panels. Further, the basic principles of distortion prevention, in-process distortion control and mitigation techniques like heat sinking, thermo-mechanical tensioning etc. are dealt with in detail. In its final section, the book describes in detail various types of weld defects that are likely to occur, together with their causes and remedial measures. The nondestructive testing methods that are most relevant to ship construction are explained. Lastly, a chapter on accuracy control based on statistical principles is included, addressing the need for a suitable mechanism to gauge the ranges of variations so that one can quantitatively target the end product accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{shipping}} in Arctic regions is increasing, {{and with this}} comes an increased interest in ice-strengthened ships. Today there exist several class rules satisfying additional requirements for operation in geographical areas with ice-infested waters. Hence, it is crucial for classification societies, designers and ship-owners to understand how formulations of each rule-set impact on structural members {{to be able to}} design a ship that suits a certain operational purpose. The aim of this thesis is to perform a comparison study on structural properties and steel grades on mid-bodies with a constant cross section, regarding ice-strengthening requirements relevant in the icereinforced region. To provide an overview of fundamental differences of ice class rule-sets, a comparison is conducted through case studies in which three different fictitious ships are used. The rule formulations of Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules (FSICR), IACS Polar Class and the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) are compared with an emphasis on the local structure and material requirements. Since the comparison is focused on rule-sets, no numerical analysis on the strength is considered. To enable comparisons between class rules, a computer code is developed where the rule-sets are adopted. The computer code uses ship particulars together with rule formulations to calculate the outcome on the actual local strength of each rule-set. Main parameters, i. e. frame spacing, direction of frames, displacement and yield strength in the rule formulation are varied in order to find their influence on the weight and structural properties. In addition to this, issues in the results are identified together with recommendations of areas that need to be further looked into with a numerical analysis on the actual structure. The comparison shows that the direction of framing {{plays a major role in}} the reinforcements needed and the total weight outcome on mid-bodies with a constant cross section. Due to the shape of the ice load, <b>transverse</b> <b>framing</b> has favourable requirements on local design in the perspective of weight. The result has been validated with the DNV software Nauticus Hull. It is found that when designing a ship according to notations with higher requirements, “tailormade” beam profiles may result in a better distribution of structural safety margins and a lighter structure. The study also shows that requirements on steel grade depending on structural member and thickness vary between rule-sets. It is concluded that using steel with higher yield strength can be economical since it may result in a lower requirement on the grade and less material in the structure. The study shows a case with a weight-saving of 9 % and a cost-saving of 5 % when upgrading the yield strength. To be aware of these behaviours one can benefit from this and design an approved structure that fulfils the requirements with reduced weight and cost...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} usage of {{floating}} frames in boats. A floating <b>frame</b> is a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> fittedto the longitudinal stiffener flanges without contact with the shell plating, {{as opposed to the}} traditionalfixed frame which is welded to the shell plating with the stiffeners most commonly fitted through cut outsin the frame. To study the floating frame structure in a bigger perspective a finite element analysis is performed on amid ship compartment of an existing 60 m high speed catamaran ferry. The analysis is performed on amodel with scantlings as the original craft but with introduced floating frames. Stresses are analysed withrespect to maximum allowable stress as given in the DNV-rules for HAZ. High stresses are found {{in the bottom of the}} frames due to the reduced bending stiffness without effectiveflange from the shell plating. A large deformation in the shell plating relative the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> isfound, creating high stresses in the stiffener webs. This deformation is induced by a large verticaldeformation of the frames. It is concluded that the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> requires an increased stiffness to achieve acceptable stress levels. Possible solutions to increase stiffness are discussed, further studies are required to achieve an acceptablestructure. A design criterion for stiffeners in floating frame constructions is evaluated. The criterion considers theinteraction between a concentrated contact force and a bending moment with the purpose of simplifyingthe design process of stiffeners. The criterion is a combination of design methods from DNV HSLC andEurocode 9. The design criterion is found to give conservative results, although not unreasonably conservative. Thecriterion is suitable for the design of smaller work boats where the scantlings traditionally are not veryoptimized...|$|R
