40|$|Most {{models for}} barrier pricing are {{designed}} to let a market maker tune the model-implied covariance between moves in the asset spot price and moves in the implied volatility skew. This is often implemented with a local volatility/stochastic volatility mixture model, where the mixture parameter tunes that covariance. This paper defines an alternate model where the spot/volatility correlation is a separate mean-reverting stochastic variable which is itself correlated with spot. We also develop an efficient approximation for barrier option and one <b>touch</b> <b>pricing</b> in the model based on semi-static vega replication and compare it with Monte Carlo pricing. The approximation works well in markets where the risk neutral drift is modest. ...|$|R

50|$|The Constellation Quest is {{the first}} {{smartphone}} by Vertu, equipped with a full QWERTY keyboard made from sapphire sculpted keys.

40|$|Pakistan {{is facing}} acute energy crises since last few years. Due to {{shortage}} of fuel oil and its sky <b>touching</b> <b>prices,</b> it seems very uneconomical {{to generate electricity}} from fuel oil. In order to generate cheap electricity we {{have to rely on}} renewable energy resources. To address these challenges, wind power generation is among the popular options in the world which is now being considered in Pakistan as well. However unremitting change in wind speed from calm to stormy introduces real challenges. Storing wind energy in batteries during the periods of low demand seems an expensive option, especially when dealing with large scale power generation. Due to incessantly varying nature of wind speed, it is not feasible to rely only on wind power for cheap power production. Also, it is not thriftily possible to construct separate transmission line. However if we integrate wind power with hydro power, we can utilize the maximum possible transmission capacity. Existing hydro power station operating in that area or pumped storage scheme can be used. This paper is an attempt to analyze coordination of wind generation with hydro power in those areas of Pakistan where both wind and hydro power sources exist. In this paper, different issues have been analyzed taking case study of Dargai. This paper is first attempt in Pakistan about integration of wind and hydro power to draw some general conclusions and to point out some areas in which further research can be done...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} hedonic and {{utilitarian}} motivations have impact on emotions, and in turn, influence perceived quality from Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) perspectives. Previous {{studies have been}} conducted to investigate the effects of different factors on quality of fabrics by considering product related attributes (such as fabric types, <b>touch</b> feelings, <b>price,</b> etc.) and individual characteristics (such as personality) (McCann et al., 2005). They have counted the functional aspects of fabrics but have not convincingly answered how psychological attributes influence consumers’ perceptions about the quality of fabrics; practitioners need this vital information to better understand and conduct business around how consumers formulate their perceptions. For example, our findings can guide emotional design in sportswear fabrics (Hassenzahl, 2006). Also, we develop a more sophisticated theory that investigates what psychological constructs need to be considered. We, therefore, provide initial contributions that are both relevant to practitioners and rigorous to researchers...|$|R

In an order-driven market buyers and sellers may submit limit orders, which are executed when the <b>price</b> <b>touches</b> a pre-specified lower, respectively higher, limit-price. We show that, in equilibrium, the collection of all such orders - the limit order book - implies a volatility smile, similar to observations from option pricing in the Black-Scholes model. We also show how a jump-diffusion process can be explicitly inferred to account for the volatility smile. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{antitrust}} {{treatment of}} vertical restraints is quite controversial. In the United States, for example, warring vertical restraints guidelines were {{issued by the}} Department of Justice and National Association of Attorneys General, a group of antitrust enforcers from the individual states. However, a consensus was never achieved and these guidelines never entered the mainstream. Compare them to the U. S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which have become a template for evaluation of horizontal restraints. The new EC Guidelines on Vertical Restraints Guidelines (2 ̆ 2 GVRs 2 ̆ 2) represent a significant effort to create and implement a consistent analytic framework for evaluating vertical restraints. The scope of the project is quite significant. The category of vertical restraints represents a broad set of practices that raise an array of issues - efficiencies, collusion, foreclosure, intrabrand vs. interbrand competition and so on. In this short article, I examine the central foreclosure issues in the GVRs. I focus mainly on the general enforcement policy, though I do discuss the block exemption regulation at the end.

40|$|Abstract: Public policy {{designed}} to encourage home ownership has operated primarily through the federal income tax system in the United States. With multiple incentives for home-ownership, the income tax system is the main tool by which the federal government encourages families to become home-owners and accumulate wealth {{in the form of}} real estate. Recent policy debate over reform of the tax system has questioned whether a mainstay of this system, the mortgage interest deduction (MID), {{is the best way to}} accomplish the stated objective. Last year the President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended converting the MID into a 15 % tax credit subject to regional caps related to median house <b>prices,</b> <b>touching</b> off a vigorous public debate on the importance of the MID. The purpose of this paper is to examine economic implications of that recommendation. We model how switching from the MID to a credit would affect housing finance choices between debt and equity and show how these changes would have changed the tax benefits for various households. Furthermore, we simulate the number of mortgage originations in 2004 (the most recent year which data is available) that would have been subject to the caps in the Panel’s recommendation, and we identify the specific urban housing markets that would have been most severely affected. Finally, we conclude with policy discussion of the proposed credit alternative...|$|R
40|$|Based on the closed-form {{solutions}} {{of partial}} barrier options, we derive {{the prices of}} general reset options with m reset levels and continuous reset dates. Furthermore, we provide some special characteristics of reset call and put options. We explore the phenomena of delta jump existing for reset call and put options during the entire reset period whenever the stock <b>price</b> <b>touches</b> the barriers. For practical application, we use the reset call options with continuous reset dates as control variates to evaluate the prices of six arithmetic average reset options listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1998 to 1999. Path-dependent options, whose payoffs {{are influenced by the}} path of the prices of underlying assets, have become increasingly popular in recent years. One of path-dependent options is reset option. The strike prices of these options would be adjusted only on the specified reset dates if the price of underlying asset is below one of the reset levels. In practice, reset options have been traded for many years. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) both introduced S&P 500 index put warrants with three-month reset period in late 1996. Morgan Stanley issued a reset warrant with an initial strike price of $ 44. 73 in July 1997. The strike price would be adjusted to $ 39. 76 on August 5, 1997 if the price of its underlying asset fell below $ 39. 76. In 1998...|$|R
