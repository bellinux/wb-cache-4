2500|$|<b>The</b> {{principles}} <b>stated</b> in <b>the</b> resolutions {{became known}} as the [...] "Principles of '98".

The Kentucky Resolution of 1799 added <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> <b>states</b> determine <b>that</b> a law is unconstitutional, nullification by <b>the</b> <b>states</b> is <b>the</b> proper remedy.

5|$|The World Bank {{considered}} the cyclone {{as having a}} significant effect on Andhra Pradesh's economy. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> would take as long as 30years to recover from the storm. The government provided RS$1,500 (US$420) to every family whose hut collapsed during the storm, and RS$100,000 (US$2,857) to the family of every person killed by the storm. However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure.|$|E
