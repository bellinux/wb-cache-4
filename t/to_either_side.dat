5|$|The Main Stand, {{which can}} seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which runs around {{two-thirds of the}} pitch. It {{contains}} the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> {{one of which is}} where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side.</b> At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers.

5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in the bow and two 6-pounder chase guns in the stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow the guns to pivot <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|The organelles of the endomembrane {{system are}} related through direct contact {{or by the}} {{transfer}} of membrane segments as vesicles. Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. The thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified {{several times during the}} membrane's life. One unifying characteristic the membranes share is a lipid bilayer, with proteins attached <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> or traversing them.|$|E
5|$|The west front, {{which was}} {{originally}} constructed in 1520, {{has a large}} arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings of angels and <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503 this is a direct reference to {{the dream of the}} prophet Jacob mentioned in the Bible and commonly called Jacobs Ladder.|$|E
5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E

5|$|Unknown <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged {{an attack}} against the British {{position}} at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. These men, {{and some of the}} prisoners they freed along the way, were back in the American camp by September 29.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> {{so it could}} be pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February, {{with the}} help of the French {{ambassador}} Léon Roches, a plan was formulated to stop the imperial court's advance at Odawara, the last strategic entry point to Edo, but Yoshinobu decided against the plan. Shocked, Léon Roches resigned from his position. In early March, under the influence of the British minister Harry Parkes, foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement, according to which they could not intervene or provide military supplies <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> until the resolution of the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, {{which were}} of a size and range not {{previously}} available to the Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.|$|E
5|$|The Bayern-class battleships {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight 38cm (15in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 twin gun turrets. These turrets could train 150degrees <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> of the centerline, and their guns could depress to −8degrees. As the Germans thought that {{conditions}} in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16degrees, which allowed a maximum range of 20,400m. The gun mountings were modified to allow elevation up to 20degrees, increasing the range to 23,200m.|$|E
25|$|The {{views are}} good <b>to</b> the <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> the Helvellyn range nearby {{to the east}} and a wide {{selection}} of major fells visible on the opposite flank of the ridge. Higher neighbours obstruct the view to north and south.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the shorter trains may have created an even rougher experience than was typical for a Traver Cyclone. It {{was described as a}} [...] "rib tickler" [...] where the side-to-side motion of the cars (particularly on the coaster's rapidly undulating [...] "Jazz Track") would slam riders' ribs <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>sides</b> of the cars. This led to problems of low ridership (and particularly repeat ridership) that plagued the other Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters. The smaller-than-usual trains, which like the other Cyclones could only run one-at-a-time, also contributed to this problem.|$|R

5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating {{ethnic tensions}} in the Lika region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in Lovinac, {{an attack on a}} Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E

Using the two-way directional joystick and the button for flapping the ostrich's wings, the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava; when maneuvering {{off the screen}} <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> the player will continue its path reappearing from the opposite side. The {{rate at which the}} player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, {{followed by a}} lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates {{the form of the}} spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 2002 & 2003, the Social Hall {{suffered}} extensive roof damage after a sizable amount of snowfall. The building was irreparable, so plans were drawn up to construct a new, larger building. The foundation was laid in 2003 and the building was officially completed for the 2004 summer season. The building features a state-of-the-art sound booth {{in the back of}} the building, with costume rooms, larger bathrooms and a dance room and weight room off <b>to</b> <b>either</b> <b>sides.</b> The building received another facelift in the fall of 2006, when hard wood flooring was placed throughout the building.|$|R
