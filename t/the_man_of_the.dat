5|$|After Birmingham were relegated {{at the end}} of the season, {{the club}} took up their option of an extra year on Doyle's contract, despite accusations of {{inappropriate}} late-night drinking after the club's end-of-season dinner. He made 16 appearances in the 2011–12 season, including three matches in Birmingham's UEFA Europa League campaign, and both legs of the Championship play-off semi-final. He made an error in a 2–1 win over Maribor, where he misjudged a pass from Jonathan Spector to allow Dalibor Volaš to score the match's opening goal. In the FA Cup, Doyle saved two penalties from Juan Mata in the FA Cup; one in the initial fifth-round match, which finished 1–1, and one in the replay, which ended in a 2–0 defeat. His performance in the initial match against Chelsea resulted in him being named as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. At the end of the season, he received a special award for completing ten senior seasons with the club, extended to an eleventh when he signed a one-year contract, despite expectations that youngster Jack Butland might be first choice goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the first round; Somerset faced first-class opposition {{in each of the}} four rounds prior to the final. In their semi-final match against Essex, Somerset only progressed as they had lost fewer wickets in a tied match. Sussex played against minor counties in each of the first two rounds, but only beat Staffordshire by two runs to advance from the second round, before more straightforward victories against first-class opposition in the later stages. Somerset batted first, but with the exception of Ian Botham, the batsmen struggled to score runs fluently. They scored 207 runs for 7 wickets, of which Botham scored 80 and Viv Richards 44. Sussex began their run-chase well, with a first-wicket partnership of 93, before losing four wickets in quick succession. A second partnership, between Paul Parker and Paul Phillipson led Sussex to victory by five wickets, chasing down Somerset's total with more than six overs to spare. Parker was named as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match for his score of 62 not out.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{opened the}} batting against Sri Lanka in the final.

Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes, the highest individual score in a World Cup final, eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting's score of 140 in the 2003 final. Australia won and he was named <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings.|$|E
5|$|Holroyd joined League One club Preston North End for an {{undisclosed}} fee on 20 January 2012.

He made his debut a day later playing in a new position on the right wing and winning <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match award in a 2–0 home defeat to Leyton Orient. Holroyd scored his first goal for Preston on 21 April 2012, heading in a Danny Mayor cross at the back post in a 1–1 draw away at Oldham Athletic.

5|$|In January 2014, Pogba {{was named}} by The Guardian {{as one of}} the ten most {{promising}} young players in Europe. On 20 February, Pogba scored his first goal in UEFA club competitions as Juventus defeated Trabzonspor 2–0 at home in the first leg of the round of 32 of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. On 14 April, Pogba produced an assist in Juventus's 2–0 win over Udinese, the same team that Pogba scored two magnificent goals against in the previous season. Later that week, Pogba scored the only goal in Juventus's 1–0 win over Bologna. Pogba was also named <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match for his performance. Pogba would prove to be a key player for the club that season, breaking into the starting line-up, and making more appearances (51) for the club than any other player across all competitions that season, also scoring 9 goals. He finished the season by winning his second consecutive Serie A title under manager Antonio Conte, and reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Swann {{made his}} debut in January 2000 against South Africa, but off-field misdemeanours {{resulted}} in him being {{dropped from the}} team after just one match, {{and he did not}} play international cricket again until 2007. His solitary five-wicket haul in ODIs was against Australia in September 2009, a match England won by four wickets. Swann took five wickets for 28 runs in the match, and was given <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match award. He took 104 wickets in ODIs at an average of 27.76. Swann took 51 wickets in T20I cricket, but did not claim any five-wicket hauls; his best bowling figures in the format were three wickets for 13 runs. As of July 2015, his combined tally of 18 five-wicket hauls is twenty-seventh in the all-time list, a position he shares with Lance Gibbs.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; {{some strong}} performances for the England Lions, {{especially in a}} match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in the}} squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset.|$|E
