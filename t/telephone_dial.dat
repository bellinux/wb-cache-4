25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, {{the first one}} or two digits of {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan areas were alphabetical, with each letter representing a distinct number on the <b>telephone</b> <b>dial.</b> Each one-letter or two-letter code signified an exchange within an urban area. Rural and regional areas typically relied on manual exchanges, or only one automatic exchange for the whole town, so rural and regional numbers did not feature these letter prefixes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} areas of North America, {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan communities {{consisted of a}} combination of digits and letters, starting in the 1920s until the 1960s. Letters were translated to dialed digits, a mapping that was displayed directly on the <b>telephone</b> <b>dial.</b> Each of the digits 2 to 9, and sometimes 0, corresponded to a group of typically three letters. The leading two or three letters of a telephone number indicated the exchange name, for example, EDgewood and IVanhoe, and were followed by 5 or 4 digits. The limitations that these system presented in terms of usable names that were easy to distinguish and spell, and the need for a comprehensive numbering plan that enabled direct-distance dialing, led to the introduction of all-number dialing in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, many local {{telephone}} companies, {{as well as}} the North American Numbering Plan of 1947, prescribed telephone number formats that included the name of the central office to which each telephone was connected. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, other locally significant names, but larger communities that required more than one central office, may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2-4, for example, as shown in the photo of a <b>telephone</b> <b>dial</b> of 1939 (right). In this example, LAkewood 2697, indicates that a subscriber dialed the letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E

2500|$|While the Strowger (step-by-step or SxS) switch moves {{synchronously}} {{with the}} dial pulses {{that come from}} the <b>telephone</b> <b>dial,</b> the more sophisticated Panel switch had senders, similar to {{the directors of the}} later Director system Strowger exchanges used in London and other large British cities. The sender first registered and stored the digits that the customer dialed, and then, with the help of other frames, translated the received digits into numbers appropriate for the selectors: District Brush, District Group, Office Brush, Office Group, Incoming Brush, Incoming Group, Final Brush, Final Tens, Final Units.|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an {{undertaker}} in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the stepping switch, {{a device}} {{which led to}} the automation of telephone circuit switching. While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary <b>telephone</b> <b>dial,</b> each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact [...] "hand" [...] of the stepping switch to first step (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit.|$|E
