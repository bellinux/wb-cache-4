40|$|We {{consider}} a problem concerning tilings of rectangular regions by a finite library of polyominoes.

We call this a subtiling. We show that the associated decision problem is NP-complete when restricted to rectangular polyominoes.

In this lecture we will show how to generate a uniformly random chosen lozenge <b>tiling</b> <b>of</b> a given surface and we will bound the time {{we need to do}} that.
