500|$|Laubenstein {{was also}} an outspoken AIDS activist and criticized the American {{government}} for what she saw as a reluctance to combat the AIDS epidemic. She was also critical of the Catholic Church for its treatment of lesbians and gay men. Some of her opinions caused controversy among other gay activists, such as her call to close gay bathhouses to discourage unsafe sexual behaviors and therefore reduce HIV transmission. Playwright Larry Kramer, who befriended Laubenstein after she cared for his partner, who died from AIDS, {{said that she was}} [...] "probably the first doctor <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> [...] stop having sex altogether".|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E

500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the achievements of}} Scott and Amundsen, most polar historians generally accept that Amundsen's skills with ski and dogs, his general familiarity with ice conditions, and his clear focus on a non-scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages {{in the race for}} the Pole. Scott's verdict on the disaster that overtook his party, written when he was close to death, lists the initial loss of pony transport, weather conditions, [...] "a shortage of fuel in our depots for which I cannot account", and the sickening of Evans and Oates, but ultimately Scott concludes that [...] "our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather [...] on the Barrier [...] in the day, [...] at night". Presumably with regard to the failed rendez-vous with the dog teams requested for 1 March 1912, Scott furthermore wrote [...] "No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have lacked support". Cherry-Garrard, whom Atkinson placed in charge of the dog teams which started late, failed to meet Scott and turned for home, observes that [...] "the whole business simply bristles with 'ifs'"; an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe. But [...] "we were as wise as anyone can be before the event." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had lacked support."

The Cuban farmer’s quip provides a pragmatic corollary to Russell’s observation, or injunction. Grasping this challenge entails reorienting how we study world politics, as well as broader attention {{to the ways in}} which collective understanding is organized.

2500|$|There is even {{a further}} {{suggestion}} that Drews has noticed. Why was the reversal of the order made? Evidently to bring the Intercession before the Consecration. This means to change from the same order as Antioch to that of Alexandria. Is it too much to suppose {{that we have here}} a case of Alexandrine influence at Rome? Now it is noticeable that Gelasius personally had a great reverence for the venerable [...] "second See" [...] founded by St. Mark, and that since 482 Bishop John Talaia of Alexandria, being expelled from his own Church by the Monophysites, sought and found refuge in Rome. He would have celebrated his own liturgy in the pope's city, and was certainly greatly honoured as a confessor and exile for the Faith. May we then even go so far as <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> owe the present certainly unusual order of our Canon to Gelasius and the influence of John Talaia?

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{simulation}} and theoretical results concerning the finite sample theory of QML estimators in ARCH models when we include an exogenous {{variable in the}} conditional variance equation. In this setting, we find theoretical and simulation support <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> consider two exogenous variables with the same variance, {{the one that has}} the larger sample mean is more likely to produce a larger bias in the QML estimators, {{in such a way that}} can be quite misleading in practical applications. We warn about the existence of important biases and potentially low power of the t-tests in these cases. We also propose ways to deal with them. Finally, we generalize the Lumsdaine (1995) invariance properties for the biases in these situations. An empirical application shows the usefulness of our theoretical results. ...|$|R

And probably is it not merely a coincidence that each complete subset of bits (properties) means the holohedry of a crystal system; and each new bit means a new crystal system. The purpose of this article was of course not to draw a conclusive theory, but <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> ideas <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> hope, will be useful for researchers in mathematics, group theory and crystallography...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, I {{have speculated}} on the {{interior}} as a site and an idea of betweeness. Feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray (Irigaray 1999) has associated the concept of interior with dualist and gendered philosophies. Nevertheless, the interior as a site has offered many opportunities for artists and occupants to challenge how we inhabit and change architecture. In this paper, I will focus on a design project that involves experimental making and living {{as part of a}} subversive approach <b>to</b> architecture: <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might re-conceptualise “interior ” as the space of betweeness rather than the space of the contained. This paper, part of my ongoing doctoral research, has extended ideas about the interior that I explored in the 2003 IDEA journal and has reflected my personal experience of collaborative, experimental design practices. The purpose of my research is to explore the betweeness of spatial practice...|$|R

If the orthogonal threshold in SUS is small and the power is equally allocated among the selected users, such a scheme will resemble the PU 2 RC. However, in CoMP systems, the PBPC may not be met with the equal power allocation. When considering the power allocation under the PBPC, each user does not know the power allocated <b>to</b> it.

50|$|Professor Simons' {{research}} has focused on the cognitive underpinnings of our experience of a stable and continuous visual world. One line of research focuses on change blindness. These failures to notice large changes <b>to</b> scenes <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are aware of far less of our visual world than we think. Related studies explore what aspects of our environment automatically capture attention and what objects and events go unnoticed. Such studies reveal the surprising extent of inattentional blindness - the failure to notice unusual and salient events in their visual world when attention is otherwise engaged and the events are unexpected. Other active research interests include scene perception, object recognition, visual memory, visual fading, attention, and driving and distraction. Research in his laboratory adopts methods ranging from real-world and video-based approaches to computer-based psychophysical techniques, and it includes basic behavioral measures, eye tracking, simulator studies, and training studies. This diversity of approaches helps establish closer links between basic research on the mechanisms of attention and the real-world implications and consequences of the findings.|$|R
