5|$|Facilities {{for wine}} {{tourists}} in Oregon are considered underdeveloped compared <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> regions in California, especially premium growing regions like the Napa Valley AVA. Only 5% of overnight leisure trips {{in the state}} involve visits to wineries, a much smaller figure than comparable Californian growing regions, which range from 10% to 25%.|$|E
5|$|With the {{continuing}} {{improvement in the}} region's winemaking reputation, enotourism in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right. On-site sales are becoming an increasingly {{important part of the}} business of Oregon winemaking, and other businesses that cater <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> tourists, such as lodging, fine restaurants, art galleries, have been appearing in places like Dundee, many of which have long been rural farming communities. Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace. It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms. There are approximately 1.8 million visits to Oregon wineries each year, 59% by Oregonians and 41% from out of state visitors. Major events drawing significant numbers of tourists <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> country include the International Pinot Noir Celebration which is held the last weekend of July every year since 1987 and the more recent Oregon Chardonnay Celebration.|$|E
5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New Guinean species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as lead(II) acetate ("sugar of lead"), diethylene glycol, and methanol <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the European Union and the American Food and Drug Administration, across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Chaptalization has {{generated}} controversy and discontent in the French wine industry due to advantages {{that the process}} is perceived to give producers in poor-climate areas.

25|$|The {{wine bottle}} {{has been given}} certain shapes {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>wine.</b> The most emblematic is the bottle of sparkling wine: because of the pressure inside it is a fairly thick glass.

50|$|Flat: In {{relation}} <b>to</b> sparkling <b>wines,</b> flat refers <b>to</b> a <b>wine</b> {{that has}} lost its effervescence. In all other wines the term is used interchangeably with flabby <b>to</b> denote a <b>wine</b> that is lacking acidity, particularly on the finish.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{there has}} been growth in {{industries}} relating <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> storage.

25|$|The wine {{has been}} {{described}} as 'velvety' or 'unctuous'. The characteristic fruit flavor is plum, sometimes tending towards prune.

25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> {{expert and}} Master of Wine Hugh Johnson, Pomerol {{requires}} less aging than most Bordeaux: 5 years is usually sufficient, and 12 years is enough {{even for the}} grandest vintages. Johnson notes that Pomerols are usually distinguished by their deep color and sometimes creamy, concentrated ripe-plum flavors but without the high acidity and tannins that are typical of other Bordeaux wines.|$|E

25|$|In the Valle d'Aosta DOC, locals {{refer to}} the {{indigenous}} grape Premetta as a rosato naturale due to the extremely thin and lightly pigmented skins of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a very pale rosé wine. According <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d'Aosta Premetta rosés are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.|$|E
25|$|The many biblical {{references}} to alcoholic beverages are {{both positive and}} negative, real and symbolic, descriptive and didactic. Both archaeological evidence and written records indicate the significant cultivation of grapes in ancient Israel and the popularity of wine-drinking.

25|$|Like the Phoenicians, the Greeks and the Romans, {{the ancient}} Israelites {{were far more}} drawn <b>to</b> <b>wine</b> than they were to beer.
