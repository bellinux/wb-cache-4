5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development.

Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E

5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect {{incandescent}} light bulbs from 1879 {{while they were}} being developed in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric light bulbs from Edison and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light bulbs known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Homer becomes {{depressed}} {{after learning}} {{he has lived}} past the halfway point of the average life expectancy for men without accomplishing anything worthwhile. His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan of. When the film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E

5|$|The musical {{would have}} {{featured}} Tucker predominantly, but storylines would have interwoven <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison,</b> Henry Ford, Harvey Samuel Firestone and Andrew Carnegie as supporting characters. Leonard Bernstein agreed {{to write the}} music, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green were hired to write the lyrics. They all spent a week at Coppola's home in California, planning the musical which resulted in Bernstein writing one song. Coppola also approached Gene Kelly as a consultant for the dance choreography. However, financing for Tucker fell through when Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope, filed for bankruptcy after the box office failures of One from the Heart (1982) and The Cotton Club (1984). Coppola abandoned Tucker {{for the time being}} and went to work on Peggy Sue Got Married (1986).|$|E
5|$|To secure phenol for aspirin production, and at {{the same}} time {{indirectly}} aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great Phenol Plot. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new branding strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison,</b> who needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for trinitrophenol production.|$|E
5|$|President James A. Garfield died {{four days}} before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a {{courtesy}} call to newly inaugurated President Chester A. Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. <b>Thomas</b> <b>Edison</b> was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E
