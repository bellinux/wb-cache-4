We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E
5|$|Wright met {{his last}} girlfriend, Pamela Wright (the shared surname is a coincidence), in 2001 in Felixstowe, {{and they moved}} {{to the house in}} Ipswich {{together}} in 2004. Wright had always admitted that he had used prostitutes, firstly whilst in the Merchant Navy, and continuously throughout his life. Investigations into other crimes Wright might have committed continue, including the possibility of an involvement in the Suzy Lamplugh disappearance. However Metropolitan Police have stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> strong line of enquiry.|$|E

25|$|Concerns of {{a decline}} in the booby {{population}} of the Galapagos Islands prompted a research project in its cause. The project, completed in April 2014, confirmed the population decline. The blue-footed booby population appears to having trouble breeding and thus is slowly declining. The decline is feared to be long-term, but annual data collection is needed for a firm conclusion <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> normal fluctuation.|$|E
25|$|He {{is one of}} {{a number}} of high profile murderers or sex {{offenders}} to have been identified as possible suspects in the Suzy Lamplugh case; he had worked with Lamplugh on the QE2 ocean liner during the early 1980s. Lamplugh went missing in London in July 1986, and was legally declared dead in 1994, but her body has never been found. However, the Metropolitan Police have stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> strong line of enquiry.|$|E

25|$|Although NMDA antagonists {{were once}} thought to {{reliably}} cause neurotoxicity in humans {{in the form of}} Olney's lesions, recent research suggests otherwise. Olney's lesions involve mass vacuolization of neurons observed in rodents. However, many suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> valid model of human use, and studies conducted on primates have shown that use must be heavy and chronic to cause neurotoxicity. Indeed, a 2009 review found no evidence of ketamine-induced neuron death in humans. However, temporary and permanent cognitive impairments have been shown to occur in long-term or heavy human users of the NMDA antagonists PCP and ketamine. A large-scale, longitudinal study found that current frequent ketamine users have modest cognitive deficits, while infrequent or former heavy users do not.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs. Union opponents respond {{that this is an}} example of the broken window fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.|$|E
25|$|Mick and Stan's {{relationship}} {{starts to}} thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), with little success. Tina {{refers to the}} incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley {{to admit that she}} had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear and he makes progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families think they are. Linda turns down the proposal, liking things as they are, and then she finds out that Dean has overheard this conversation.|$|E

In this situation, the third party can be sued by somebody that he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|E
500|$|As {{reported}} by The Korea Times, {{the thought of}} Gothel being a villain who is both a [...] "greedy, selfish woman and a mother figure to Rapunzel" [...] was initially [...] "perplexing" [...] for animator Jin Kim, and it wasn't until after Kim heard Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time}} that he [...] "came up with the 1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for the character. The directors also strived to make it obvious that Mother Gothel and Rapunzel are not related. Greno told Animation World Network, [...] "When they're standing together, it is very clear <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> mother and daughter, just by the frames of their bodies, their hair, the pigments of their skin," [...] as opposed to when Rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents, the King and Queen. Howard added that, in comparison to Rapunzel, [...] "Gothel is very tall and curvy, she’s very voluptuous, she’s got this very exotic look to her. Even down to that curly hair, we’re trying to say visually that this is not this girl’s mother." [...] The animators studied footage of Murphy in order to get [...] "ideas about facial expressions" [...] and [...] "gestures." [...] After much speculation, the directors finally admitted that, in addition to Murphy, Gothel's physical appearance was in fact influenced by American singer Cher. Howard explained that this was [...] "because Cher is very exotic and Gothic looking," [...] continuing that the singer [...] "definitely was one of the people we looked at visually, as far as what gives you a striking character." ...|$|E

500|$|Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{some of whom}} praised him as {{a better}} character than Simba. Author Peter M. Nichols wrote in his book New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies: A Critic's Guide to the Best Films Available on Video and DVD that Scar [...] "is the most interesting character in the film," [...] describing Simba and Mufasa [...] "bores in comparison." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Scar a [...] "delectably wicked" [...] villain. Maslin went on to praise Irons' voice acting, writing that the actor [...] "slithers through the story in grandiose high style, with a green-eyed malevolence {{that is one of}} film's chief delights." [...] Leah Rozen of People described Scar as [...] "a flawless realization of Irons' special talent." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Scar as the film's [...] "best character," [...] jokingly describing him as [...] "Irons' Claus von Bulow with fur." [...] Similarly, ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes hailed Scar as [...] "the best part of the film." [...] Praising both Scar and Irons' acting, Starnes continued, [...] "He switches so quickly and easily from campy to deadly its like a showcase for how to do an over-the-top villain right." [...] Concluding that [...] "Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film," [...] Roger Ebert described Scar [...] "one of the great ones." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews reviewed, [...] "Gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of Ursula, Gaston, and Jafar," [...] writing, [...] "Scar is a sinister figure, given to acid remarks and cunning villainy." [...] Berardinelli concluded, [...] "The cold-hearted manner in which he causes Mufasa's death lets us know <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> lion to be trifled with." ...|$|E
