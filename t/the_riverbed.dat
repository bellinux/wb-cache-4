5|$|As {{with the}} earlier {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in <b>the</b> <b>riverbed,</b> leading many historians {{to conclude that the}} area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. The most significant item found was the Celtic La Tène style bronze and enamel Battersea Shield, {{one of the most important}} pieces of Celtic military equipment found in Britain, recovered from <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> during dredging for the piers.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} of springbok Antidorcas marsupialis, gemsbok Oryx gazella, blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and red hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus to rainfall along <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> of <b>the</b> southern Kalahari are analysed. Springbok reacted most rapidly to rainfall along <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> and, by browsing in dry times, maintained a fairly stable presence throughout the year, although {{the actual number}} present in any one year was dependent on annual rainfall. Gemsbok responded more slowly to rainfall and reached their highest numbers in years of high rainfall when the grasses were tall and mature, after which they rapidly departed from <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds.</b> Red hartebeest also reached their highest numbers during the rainy season, but departed slightly more slowly than gemsbok. In dry years, they too, failed to come into <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds.</b> Blue wildebeest {{in the vicinity of}} <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> tended to be more sedentary than the other species. The presence of potable artificial water appeared to be more important for wildebeest than for the other species and, although rainfall was undoubtedly an important factor in regulating their numbers along <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds,</b> they depended to a greater extent on breeding success and mortality factors, than on emigration and immigration. The overall seasonal pattern of ungulate abundance along <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> in <b>the</b> southern Kalahari was one of wet season concentrations and dry season dispersion...|$|R

5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into <b>the</b> <b>riverbed.</b> Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on <b>the</b> <b>riverbed,</b> and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
50|$|The City of Arts and Sciences is {{situated}} {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> former <b>riverbed</b> of <b>the</b> river Turia, which was drained and rerouted after a catastrophic flood in 1957. <b>The</b> old <b>riverbed</b> was turned into a picturesque sunken park.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} series of ice ages, {{the flow of}} the Missouri was {{diverted}} to its current <b>riverbed.</b> <b>The</b> Milk River now flows through part of <b>the</b> Missouri's ancient <b>riverbed.</b> <b>The</b> continental glaciers also deposited large amounts of rocks and sediment on the landscape.|$|R
50|$|The dam {{is located}} near the Balcones Escarpment. The rocky canyons {{to the west of}} the {{escarpment}} can carry more water than <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> of <b>the</b> plains to the east; this has caused problems with flash flooding in cities and towns east of the escarpment.|$|R
5|$|Much of the Midway area {{is former}} {{marshland}} {{which has been}} filled in for development. In fact, the San Diego River used to flow through the Midway area into San Diego Bay, isolating Point Loma from San Diego. Because of fears that San Diego Bay might silt up, the river was diverted to its present course north of Point Loma by a levee built in 1877. Parts of Liberty Station and Point Loma Village are also fill land, reclaimed from sand spits and wetlands surrounding the Bay. The only remnant of the formerly extensive wetlands in Point Loma, aside from <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> itself, is a city-owned nature preserve called Famosa Slough, which branches off from the river near its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Sen, No-Face and Boh {{meet with}} the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car (which is now covered in dust) and drive away.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

50|$|The slender {{lungfish}} is a {{freshwater fish}} and it largely inhabits {{the middle and}} lower Congo River basin. It is a primarily demersal fish, dwelling in <b>the</b> <b>riverbeds</b> of <b>the</b> above basins and in Stanley Pool. During spawning season, females {{can be found in}} open water.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>riverbeds</b> further inland {{are home}} to baboons, giraffes, lions, black {{rhinoceros}} and springbok. The animals get most of their water from wells dug by the baboons or elephants. The black rhinoceros population was the main reason why the CBBC show Serious Desert was filmed in the region.|$|R
5|$|Virgil (David Holliday) {{arrives in}} Thunderbird 2 and {{scatters}} the alligators with aircraft's vertical landing jets. Alan (Matt Zimmerman) and Gordon (David Graham) subdue {{two of the}} animals with heavy-duty tranquiliser guns. When the third returns to the house, Alan exits Thunderbird 2 on a hoverjet to lure the alligator away. He collides with a tree and falls from the hoverjet, but is saved by Gordon, who shoots the oncoming alligator before it can attack Alan. Culp threatens to empty the whole Theramine vial into the Ambro River unless he is granted safe passage upstream. Launching Thunderbird 4, Gordon encounters a fourth, far larger reptile that ravages Blackmer's boat and kills Culp. Virgil disposes of the creature with a missile fired from Thunderbird 2. Although it is feared at first that the vial has been smashed, Gordon retrieves it from <b>the</b> <b>riverbed</b> intact. Later, on Tracy Island, Jeff announces that Theramine {{will be subject to}} international security restrictions. Tin-Tin (Christine Finn) has been away on a shopping trip and has bought Alan a present for his upcoming birthday – a pygmy alligator.|$|E
25|$|Early {{settlers}} {{were more}} than a little discouraged by the region's diverse and unpredictable weather. They watched helplessly as long droughts weakened and starved their livestock, only to be drowned and carried off by ferocious storms. During the years of little rain, people would build too close to <b>the</b> <b>riverbed,</b> only to see their homes and barns later swept out to sea during a flood. The location of the Los Angeles Plaza had to be moved twice because of previously having been built too close to <b>the</b> <b>riverbed.</b>|$|E
