5|$|Krishna Dhun Ghose {{wanted his}} sons {{to enter the}} Indian Civil Service (ICS), an elite {{organisation}} comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England {{and so it was}} <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire family moved in 1879. The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in Manchester. Drewett was a minister of the Congregational Church whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, the {{battalion}} entrained for Fremantle, boarding troopships headed for Melbourne; it was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four battalions combined {{to form the}} 4th Brigade {{under the command of}} Colonel John Monash. After completing their basic training in Victoria, the brigade left Port Melbourne aboard Troopship A40, Ceramic on 26 December. After a brief stop at Albany, Western Australia, they arrived in Egypt in early February 1915. The brigade marched from Alexandria to Heliopolis as part of the New Zealand and Australian Division of Major General Alexander Godley.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 2/14th was {{committed}} to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, {{in the vanguard of}} the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he moved beyond the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area. A platoon was sent in to extricate Honner as the Japanese began advancing on his position, and after directing a company-level attack against the Japanese, Honner handed over command to Captain Ian Hamilton, commander of 'C' Company, who served as acting commander briefly until Major Mert Lee arrived from brigade headquarters. Lee remained in acting command until the battalion second-in-command, Major Philip Rhoden, returned from a staff course to officially take over command of the battalion as a lieutenant colonel in December.|$|E

5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the Holy Spirit had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew. It was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded <b>there,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E

25|$|The city of Green Bay had a {{population}} of only 104,057 as of the 2010 census, and only 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin {{and parts of the}} Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{redistribute}} land conflicted {{with the system}} of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's Code Rural. In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was {{in the city of}} Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movement for independence originated.|$|E

25|$|Tenerife is an {{autonomous}} territory of Spain.

25|$|Some Irish legends {{involve the}} Oilliphéist, the Caoránach, and the Copóg Phádraig. During his evangelising journey back to Ireland from his parent's home at (perhaps) Birdoswald, he is {{understood}} to have carried with him an ash wood walking stick or staff.

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Elizabeth Blount's early years, except for her {{reputation}} as a beauty, and for her famous affair with King Henry VIII (born in 1491, he was about seven years older than Bessie). There is no known portrait of her in existence. As a young girl, {{she came to the}} King's Court as a maid-of-honour to the King's wife, Catherine of Aragon. It was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young teenager caught the eye of the King and became his mistress during 1514 or 1515, a relationship which continued for about eight years.|$|E
25|$|China has an {{abundant}} potential for hydroelectric power production {{due to its}} considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the southwest of the country, where coal supplies are poor but demand for energy is rising swiftly. The potential in the northeast is fairly small, but it was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first hydroelectric stations were built—by the Japanese during its occupation of Manchuria. Due to considerable seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, the flow of rivers tends to drop during the winter, forcing many power stations to operate at less than normal capacity, while in the summer, on the other hand, floods often interfere with generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} of Serbian armed forces {{expected}} {{to take part in}} the military operation was about 60,000. King Milan I divided his force into two armies, the Nishava and Timok armies. The first took the main objective, i.e. to overcome the Bulgarian defences along the west border, to conquer Sofia and advance towards the Ihtiman heights. It was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> army was supposed to encounter and crush the Bulgarian forces coming from the southeast. Serbia's main advantages on paper were the better small arms and the highly educated commanders and soldiers, who had gained a great deal of experience from the last two wars against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|FitzGerald was {{the heir}} to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish {{parliament}} and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), and English fear was increased with the prospect of an intervention by the Spanish, who had an historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The 14th Light Horse Regiment has a {{convoluted}} lineage, {{having its}} origins in the 4th Battalion, Queensland Mounted Infantry (QMI), which was {{a unit of the}} colonial forces of the state of Queensland that was first raised in 1860. When the Second Boer War broke out, the QMI were sent to South Africa to fight alongside contingents from a number of Australian colonies and it was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unit won its first battle honour. After the Boer War the Australian colonial forces were amalgamated into the military forces of the newly federated nation of Australia. As a part of this amalgamation the four battalions of the QMI were reformed as light horse regiments, and the 4th Battalion became the 27th Light Horse Regiment.|$|E

Augustinus de Urbe, established in 1483, near the church of St. Augustine. It was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remains of St. Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, were deposited when they were brought from Ostia in the year 1430. This, formerly the chief priory of the order, was later occupied by the Italian Ministry of Marine, and the Augustinian friars who serve the church retained {{only a small portion}} of their former property.
