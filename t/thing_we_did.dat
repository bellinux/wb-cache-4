500|$|Farrell met English {{actress and}} singer Amelia Warner at {{the premiere of}} Quills in 2000. They dated from July to November 2001. There was {{speculation}} that they married; of the experience, the actor said [...] "Too fast, too young." [...] However, in December 2011 Warner told The Sun that the marriage was never legal: [...] "We had a ceremony {{on a beach in}} Tahiti that was by no means legal and we knew it wasn't... It was just a <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> on holiday. We went shark feeding and then we did that. We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel." [...] Farrell has a tattoo of Amelia's name around his ring finger.|$|E
500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it because when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz {{called the}} episode a [...] "wonderful mind game" [...] but {{was worried that}} the {{convoluted}} story and pace would confuse the viewer. In order to placate these concerns, the teleplay was assigned to be finalized by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan. Once the script was finished, Spotnitz felt the story had become much more understandable; he was particularly pleased with the way Shiban and Gilligan showed Mulder and Scully stepping on the mushrooms {{as a way to}} subtly cue their initial exposure to the hallucinogenic mushroom. Gilligan noted that [...] "another really important <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was making sure that the audience didn't think that Mulder and Scully weren't really in jeopardy—that it was all a dream, like that whole season of Dallas a few years back. That's why we made sure they realized that the goo from the mushroom would kill them".|$|E
500|$|Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while {{attending}} the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with {{others from the}} school. This {{eventually led to the}} formation of a guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz was brought on board after the two sought an additional guitarist. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that [...] "The rock n' roll <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it." [...] A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music [...] "a [...] punky thrash." [...] Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As Homem-Christo stated, [...] "We struggled so long to find [...] Darlin', and this happened so quickly." [...] Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesisers.|$|E
500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E

2500|$|A copy of Diana, Princess of Wales, wedding dress, made by Emanuel, sold {{at auction}} in 2005 for £100,000, twice the {{original}} estimate. There was some controversy surrounding the auction. The dress' owners, Madame Tussauds, {{said that it}} had been made [...] "in case of any hiccup or disaster", and {{that it had been}} tried on by Lady Diana Spencer the morning of her wedding. David Emanuel was quoted by the Western Mail, saying [...] "To say it is a direct replica is untrue. There is no such <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not make one. Diana categorically never tried this dress on, on her wedding day or at any other time, and to my knowledge never even saw it. It wasn't even made to her exact measurements, and we, of course, {{are the only ones who}} would know that." [...] The copy of Diana's dress had been given to Madame Tussauds after the wedding in 1981 and was placed on display.|$|E

The song [...] "Can It Be All So Simple," [...] from 36 Chambers, marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in Staten Island, New York. In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw. We did the hustlin' <b>thing,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way." [...] In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected [...] "Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the Tunnel. Niggas was scared to death when I was out there wilding. I was fucking niggas up, robbing niggas, fucking a lot of bitches, just doing dumb shit." ...|$|E
