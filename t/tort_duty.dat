He went on and said, if there had been no warranty (which there was) there would still be negligent misrepresentation liability in tort.

40|$|This article {{advances}} {{the premise}} that the hybrid contract-property model of leases may be appropriate to provide flexible choices for many areas of landlord-tenant law and, perhaps, may be suitable as a general model, but that it has failed as applied {{to the question of the}} tenant 2 ̆ 7 s remedies for breach of the warranty of habitability. As applied to remedies, the contract-property hybrid is a false dichotomy, or perhaps more accurately, the wrong dichotomy. The proper analysis of tenant remedies when the landlord breaches the habitability duty requires that a line be drawn between the <b>tort</b> <b>duties</b> and the contract duties that the landlord owes to the tenant. 2 ̆ 70 That line should be based upon whether the particular habitability duty in question is waivable by the tenant. Such differentiation of tort and contract elements of habitability clarifies remedies by focusing the inquiry on what type of interest is to be protected: a tenant 2 ̆ 7 s expectation of habitable premises secured by contract, or a right to habitable premises imposed as a matter of public policy and protected under tort principles. Recognition of a tort action for the second situation permits the fashioning of damage rules that neither overcompensate nor undercompensate for the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s injury. One principal benefit of the use of tort remedies lies in the analysis of non-economic damages-when, for example, the tenant claims mental distress stemming from a habitability failure...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1970 s, it was {{an article}} offaith that {{contract}} was not properly conceived as {{a means by which}} persons could, by their own choice, make law for themselves to govern their relations. Instead, contract was thought best conceived as the rectification of injuries persons may have caused by their verbal conduct {{in much the same way}} that persons have a duty to rectify the injuries caused by their physical acts. With contracts, these injuries consisted of detrimental reliance on the words of another. So conceived, both contract and <b>tort</b> <b>duties</b> are imposed by law, and do not arise from the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent. Thus contract law is conceptually indistinguishable from tort law. The doctrinal implications of this reliance-based conception of contract were twofold. First, since duties were imposed by law rather than being the product of the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent, we need not concern ourselves with many of the niceties of finding mutual assent in the formation stage. Second, if reliance was the basis of contract, then the normal expectation measure of recovery was also suspect [...] justified, if at all, as an indirect way to protect what Fuller and Perdue labeled the 2 ̆ 2 reliance interest. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, it says much about the conventional wisdom during the 1960 s and 1970 s that Fuller and Perdue 2 ̆ 7 s justly esteemed 1936 article, 2 ̆ 2 The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 2 ̆ 2 received far greater attention than Fuller 2 ̆ 7 s later 2 ̆ 2 Consideration and Form. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|John Gardner’s From Personal Life to Private Law is a {{striking}} marriage of cultivated sensibility and analytic prowess. Professor Gardner is both acutely sensitive to the lived experience of our moral relationships and highly skilled at disentangling the threads which those relationships weave together to realize rich and distinctive forms of value. From Personal Life to Private Law pursues its thesis that there are multiple and deep connections between the ideas of duty, responsibility and reparation that lie {{at the center of}} private law and their counterparts in the relationships that figure centrally in our private lives with both subtlety and rigor. The work stimulates in the way that only the best tort theory does. My Comment is shaped by two responses to this overarching theme. On the one hand, I share Gardner’s doubts that the form of the tort lawsuit should loom as large as it does in the tort theories of Coleman, Ripstein, Weinrib and others. Duties of repair live in the shadow of primary duties of respect, and come into play only when those primary duties have not been discharged. Tort lawsuits and their form are secondary, not primary. On the other hand, private law and personal life diverge in very important ways. Coercion and rights loom large in tort whereas they are conspicuously absent from Gardner’s account of the morality of private life. In private life, obligations loom much larger than rights. We have the <b>tort</b> <b>duties</b> that we have primarily because we have interests important enough to justify constraining our conduct towards each other. Many of the duties that we have in personal life, by contrast, are not owed to specific persons and are not coercively enforceable by them. Characteristically, the duties on which Professor Gardner dwells are justified because they enable to realize values which are important to our (private) lives, but which have little if anything to do with respect for important interests of others. We tend to lose sight of this fundamental difference between private law and private life if we focus too intently on the interconnections between the two domains...|$|R
40|$|Tort {{litigation}} over data breaches—defined here as {{the theft}} of one’s confidential information entrusted to another in a business transaction—most commonly involves the negligence cause of action. These claims turn {{on a number of}} issues that require searching analysis, including the manner in which the economic loss rule affects the <b>tort</b> <b>duty,</b> the relation between the negligence standard of care and strict liability, and the appropriate forms of compensable loss. Substantive analysis of these issues shows that they all can be resolved in favor of the negligence claim, which in turn justifies a rule of strict liability. The economic loss rule does not provide a substantive rationale for barring tort claims because customers do not have the information necessary to adequately protect their interests by contracting. Moreover, the common-law <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> can be independently justified by the legislative policy decisions embodied in statutes that regulate data breaches. To prove a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care, the victims of identity theft will often face considerable evidentiary difficulties stemming either from the complexity of data-security systems or the unreliability of other relevant evidence involving the conduct of defendant’s employees. For reasons recognized by tort law in analogous contexts, the evidentiary difficulties of proving negligence can justify a rule of strict liability for enforcing the <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> to exercise reasonable care. Finally, the important forms of damages caused by identity theft—the cost of credit-monitoring services and the like, unauthorized charges, and any significant loss of time and emotional distress—are all compensable as a matter of basic tort principles. Strict tort liability in these cases ultimately finds justification in the important public policy of maintaining the integrity of market transactions...|$|E
40|$|Assumption of risk has {{presented}} courts with considerable difficulty in defining its theoretical justification {{and its relationship}} to <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> limitations and to the defense of contributory negligence. In Minnesota and elsewhere, assumption of risk has been applied inconsistently. Sometimes it seems to relate to the duty issue and sometimes it is linked to the defense of contributory negligence, but without a clear differentiation of which issue is involved. In Minnesota specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court has acknowledged that inconsistency and the difficulty in applying the concept in cases spanning several decades. This article focuses on primary assumption of risk, which is the facet of assumption of risk that has created the most difficult problems, post-Springrose. The primary problem in understanding primary assumption of risk is in determining its relationship to the duty issue in tort law. A secondary and dependent problem is in determining the appropriate relationship between judge and jury for purposes of applying primary assumption of risk principles...|$|E
40|$|The absence in American {{tort law}} of {{a duty to}} {{reasonably}} aid a stranger in peril is perplexing. It is an odd gap in the otherwise nearly pervasive presence of a duty of reasonable care in the modern law of negligence. It utterly fails to accurately articulate our conventional sense of morality and appropriate social behavior. It stands {{in stark contrast to}} the treatment of this issue throughout the rest of the world. It is a rule of tort law for which very few commentators have had a kind word. This Article sets forth a spirited defense of the traditional no-duty-to-rescue rule. It offers a thoroughgoing justification for the doctrine and establishes an understanding of the practical wisdom behind its seemingly amoral veneer. It is a unique attempt in the existing legal literature to develop a clear and unapologetic rationale for this much maligned aspect of tort law. The argument begins by analyzing the likely benefits available from the adoption of a <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> to affirmatively aid. It then identifies and describes the probable costs that would accompany such a rule, including the lowering of the quality of rescue effort experienced by those in peril, the discounting of altruism, greater intrusiveness of negligence regulation, an increased risk of harm to rescuers, the creation of a disincentive to cooperate in subsequent investigations and a deterrence to provide delayed aid. In addition, the many problems attendant to the actual operation of a duty to affirmatively aid within the negligence cause of action are considered. The question of whether a limited version of a duty to affirmatively aid that would apply only to persons who possess special expertise or experience in providing aid is also analyzed, as is the role of Good Samaritan statutes in creating appropriate incentives for such individuals. Finally, the characteristics of a criminal law duty to rescue are compared to those of a tort law duty and both the relative desirability of a criminal law duty and the superfluous nature of a subsequent tort law duty are demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Daily front-page stories {{recounting the}} failure of defibrillators, pacemakers, heart stents and {{infusion}} pumps have {{raised questions about the}} adequacy of FDA regulation of medical devices. At the same time, lower courts are struggling to apply the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s ruling in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr to determine the preemptive reach of the Medical Device Amendments (2 ̆ 2 MDA 2 ̆ 2). This article explores the repercussions of Medtronic and argues that Congress 2 ̆ 7 use of words like 2 ̆ 2 requirements 2 ̆ 2 in regulatory statutes should be seen as references to positive state law only, and should not be read, absent an explicit command by Congress, to subsume state law damage actions. The lower courts 2 ̆ 7 confusion over Medtronic 2 ̆ 7 s preemption rule may have been sown by the complexity of the opinion itself. Fairly read, Medtronic 2 ̆ 7 s preemption rule is narrow, requiring specific and conflicting requirements for a device imposed by both state and federal law. General <b>tort</b> <b>duties</b> do not trigger preemption because they do not impose requirements specific to a given device. The article also explores the Executive Branch 2 ̆ 7 s current efforts to push its tort reform agenda by pressing broad preemption arguments in private tort litigation. The article argues that courts should be wary of such efforts and suggests that, by working to shield industry from tort liability, the Administration has given the public reason to question whether the FDA is serving the interests of the public or the industry it regulates. Finally, the article argues that preemption claims are an effort to shed an important source of market discipline - the threat of liability for visiting unjustifiable harm on others - a discipline that regulation cannot itself provide. Judges reviewing preemption claims should evaluate industry 2 ̆ 7 s preemption claims in light of the overall regulatory and liability context. Medical devices are an illustration of the inadequacy of relying on regulation alone. The MDA was passed in response to several notorious medical device failures, failures which were brought to light through product liability litigation. Since the MDA became law, the medical device industry has been extensively regulated by the FDA. But the FDA alone cannot exert sufficient discipline on the marketplace to ensure an adequate margin of safety for medical devices, a fact that the agency, at least until recently, itself acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} discuss the Maryland Court of Appeals {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc. and its implications for the <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> owed by researchers, in particular public health researchers, to their subjects. The Opinion resulted from two lawsuits alleging lead poisoning of children enrolled in a study conducted by the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a world renown pediatric research and treatment facility. The opinion shocked the research establishment with its scathing characterization of researchers and its apparent holding that in Maryland a parent cannot consent to the participation of a child in 2 ̆ 2 nontherapeutic research or other studies in which there is any risk of injury or damage {{to the health of the}} subject. 2 ̆ 2 While this was the focus of much of the research community, the issue in dispute in the case was that of the scope of duty of the researchers. Hoffmann and Rothenberg describe the facts leading to the case, many of which were omitted from the Court of Appeals decision which resulted from an appeal to a motion for summary judgment, and then discuss two possible interpretations of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision as it relates to the duty of researchers. One interpretation is based on a broad view of what constitutes the research endeavor and its associated risks and would arguably not result in a change in the legal duties of researchers. The other is based on a narrow view of the research project and would lead to the disclosure of risks not traditionally required by law as they fall outside of risks resulting from participation in the research protocol. The authors assert that as a result of confusion in the Opinion regarding the definition of the research study, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision may result in a significantly broader duty than has been posed historically in the research setting. In addition to exploring the contrasting interpretations of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s Opinion, the authors 2 ̆ 2 deconstruct 2 ̆ 2 the scope of the duty as articulated by the Court and pose a series of questions as to how such a duty might be discharged and how realistic the Court 2 ̆ 7 s apparent expectations are regarding the duty or researchers. Finally, they discuss the implications of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s apparent broad based duty requirement in the context of public health studies and raise the question whether the Opinion may ultimately have negative consequences for the future of public health research in Maryland and for the compensation of injured research subjects...|$|E
40|$|One whose affirmative conduct {{creates a}} {{foreseeable}} risk of physical harm {{is subject to}} the ordinary duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to those who might be foreseeably harmed by the conduct. In exceptional cases, this ordinary duty has been limited by judges as a matter of law. Judges have invoked a variety of public-policy factors to support such a limitation of liability, but have not adequately explained the nature of the justification. Consequently, the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harms recognizes that courts can limit duty when “an articulated countervailing principle or policy warrants denying or limiting liability in a particular class of cases,” and then instructs the court to clearly explain why liability should be limited. The Restatement (Third) ’s treatment of duty has been sharply criticized for adopting a brand of instrumentalism that is inconsistent with the substantive nature of a <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> rooted in individual obligations. On this view, a court’s reliance on “public policy” is an economic exercise of cost-benefit analysis that has no place in a rights-based system of private law. Contrary to this view, this article shows that a policy-based limitation of duty does not necessarily entail the type of economic or utilitarian calculus that many find to be controversial. Social value can limit duty within a rights-based tort system as well. In addition to the private interests at stake in the lawsuit, the resolution of a tort claim can affect other interests. Insofar as these interests have normative value that justifies the individual tort right and its correlative duty, they must be recognized by the court as a matter of equality. Insofar as these third-party interests are not all adequately represented by the private litigants, this social value must be accounted for by the judge in the determination of duty. To illustrate, the article reviews cases in which courts have used public-policy factors to determine whether social hosts should incur liability for drunk-driving accidents caused by their inebriated guests after leaving the event. While divided over the issue of whether a social host owes a duty to the third-party accident victim, courts nevertheless evaluate the duty by reference to a common set of social values rooted in the normative concern of individual autonomy. The autonomy interests implicated by the case at hand easily justify the duty, but courts then evaluate whether the duty would have uncertain application in other cases that would unduly restrict the autonomy of others in the community—the type of social-value inquiry that is appropriate in a rights-based tort system. This formulation of the social-value inquiry also has implications for the judge-jury issue, another aspect of the Restatement (Third) approach that has been sharply criticized. For certain types of cases, the social-value inquiry can depend on {{the facts of the case}} at hand. These duty determinations are still appropriately made by judges as a matter of law, however, because the court is evaluating the particular claim by reference to categorical (or social) values not otherwise implicated by the other elements of the tort claim. Even though these rulings rely on case-specific facts, the determination is nevertheless categorical in the manner required by the Restatement (Third). The social-value inquiry simply encompasses the full set of legally valued interests that would be affected by the duty and are not otherwise adequately addressed by the tort claim, a policy—indeed, a principle—that must be recognized by a tort system committed to the equal treatment of individuals in the community...|$|E
40|$|The {{heart of}} the Article is an {{exploration}} of the possible role of common law tort liability in both encouraging and deterring voluntary, precautionary study of new products generally and nanotechnology products in particular. A key variable in considering liability 2 ̆ 7 s role as an incentive or deterrent to testing is the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s subjective assessment of the probability that any injuries from its product would be detected by the injured parties and successfully attributed to the product absent research by the manufacturer itself on the adverse effects of the product. Another key variable is the legal standard for tort liability, and specifically how the applicable standard falls on a spectrum from the imposition of liability on manufacturers only for known risks on the one hand to the imposition of liability even for risks the manufacturer could not have reasonably foreseen on the other. The lower the perceived probability of detection without manufacturer research and the more the applicable liability standard veers toward requiring actual knowledge of risks {{on the part of the}} manufacturer, the more likely it is that the ex ante threat of liability will lead a manufacturer to choose not to conduct research into possible adverse effects, either before the product is marketed or once it is on the market. Consideration of these two variables in the nanotechnology context would tend to suggest that liability considerations indeed may be discouraging research into possible adverse effects of nanotechnology products under development and already on the market. 	 The closest precedent for the regime of limited liability relief that I propose is the regime of federal preemption of state torts that is afforded manufacturers of certain FDA-approved medical devices under federal law. FDA preemption of common law tort claims, however, is controversial, to say the least. In order to avoid the disadvantages and problems of the FDA preemption regime, any regime of liability relief for nanotechnology manufacturers who voluntarily engage in testing needs a number of components that would help ensure political accountability, scientific integrity, transparency, and a reasonable pool of compensation for injured people. The scope of preemption of state tort law claims would have to be specified by federal statute, not agency promulgation or interpretation. Any such preemption should not include claims based on allegations that a manufacturer violated a <b>tort</b> <b>duty</b> by acting or failing to act in response to actual knowledge of adverse health or environmental effects. And there must be vigorous government oversight of both voluntary pre- market and post-market testing and monitoring, and the public must have reasonable access to the key information provided regulators. Finally, in order to prevent drastic denials of compensation while encouraging voluntary study, all companies would be required to maintain liability insurance, and companies that engaged in pre- and post-market testing would receive insurance subsidies in one form or another. In voluntary regimes generally, getting initial participation may be difficult due to uncertainties of costs and benefits of participation. There would be strong incentives for some manufacturers to join a voluntary testing regime only once a number of other manufacturers of similar products have joined. Because the recruitment of initial or early participants may be difficult and would be very helpful in ultimately achieving broad participation in a voluntary testing regime, special incentives for early joiners may be warranted...|$|E

Noting the cross-doctrinal role of tort as a solver of functional problems, it focuses on major issues in products liability and medical malpractice. The essay discusses such elements of policy as the role of power in tort law, the tension between communitarianism and individualism, and the inherent limits of private law. It offers both comparisons and contrasts from the most wrenchingly generated non-tort compensation system, the September 11 th Fund.

40|$|While {{numerous}} {{courts have}} recognized the right of parents to maintain a cause of action for wrongful birth grounded in medical malpractice, the same courts have steadily refused to recognize a child 2 ̆ 7 s right to maintain a parallel cause of action for wrongful life. Recently, in Turpin v. Sortini, the California Supreme Court became the first high court of any state to recognize a child 2 ̆ 7 s right to maintain a wrongful life action based on medical malpractice. In resolving conflict between lower courts, the California Supreme Court constructed a theory of wrongful life that was based upon medical malpractice, drawing upon traditional theories of tort liability, current commentary of legal scholars concerning wrongful life actions, and recent decisions having a bearing upon the case. This Note analyzes Turpin {{in light of the}} traditional <b>tort</b> elements of <b>duty,</b> breach, causation, and damages. Consideration is also given to current policy arguments both supporting and opposing recognition of a cause of action for wrongful life. In light of these considerations, the court properly found that a cause of action should lie for wrongful life based upon medical malpractice and that monetary damages are an appropriate remedy for a plaintiff-child. However, the court did not decide correctly in refusing to allow general damages to a plaintiff-child for being born impaired as opposed to not being born at all and in limiting the damages recoverable to extraordinary expenses necessary to treatment of the hereditary ailment...|$|R
40|$|This Article corrects a {{misconception}} in corporation law – {{the belief that}} principles of tort law {{do not apply to}} the liability scheme of fiduciary duty. A board’s duty of care implies exposure to liability, but the business judgment rule precludes it. Tort law finds fault; corporation law excuses it. The conventional wisdom says that the tort analogy fails. This dismissal of tort prinicples is wrong. Although shareholder derivative suits and ordinary tort cases properly yield systemically antipodal outcomes, they are bound by a common analytical framework. The principles of board liability are rooted in <b>tort</b> doctrines governing <b>duty,</b> customs, and pure economic loss. Properly applied, they produce a duty “to care” (vis-à-vis duty of care), based on a good faith undertaking of care, but upon such undertaking no liability for negligently inflicted economic loss – the exact result achieved by the fiduciary duty of care and the business judgment rule. A sound tort analysis not only theorizes the enigmatic relationship between the duty of care and the business judgment rule, but it also explains Delaware’s puzzling procedural-substantive divide. Fiduciary duty in corporation law rests on a tort foundation. Lastly, the thesis of this Article has a broader implication. The contractarian view of corporation law seeks to relegate the role of courts to passive custodians of the corporate contractual terms provided by the legislature and the corporation’s constituents. However, this view is constrained by a tort framework wherein courts do and should play a robust, albeit reserved, role in regulating important aspects of corporate governance through the continued common law process of doctrinal development of the idea of a wrong...|$|R
40|$|This {{instructional}} case {{examines the}} relationship between a CPA and his client. The case is suitable for use with upper-level accounting majors (juniors or seniors) as many of these students are likely to enter public practice and therefore are likely to be exposed to some of the ethical dilemmas addressed in this case. As such, the case could be included as a capstone to an advanced accounting course or used in an auditing course to emphasize accountants' ethical responsibilities and the application of ethics in 'real world' situations. Alternatively, if the accounting curriculum includes a specific course on ethics then the case would be suitable for this purpose. This case can be assigned in two ways: (1) as an individual project or (2) as a group project (ideally three or four students). The major objective of this case is to enhance students' understanding of an accountant's legal and ethical duties to the client. In this case, three legal areas are analyzed: contract law. <b>tort</b> law (fiduciary <b>duty)</b> and <b>tort</b> law (professional negligence/malpractice). This case is based on facts that were presented before an accounting body's professional disciplinary committee, and examines a number of dealings between a CPA and a small business client. The issues examined include: the acquisition by a CPA of a client from a former employer, the withdrawal of fees for accounting services without express client approval, and the provision of inaccurate client financial statements.

40|$|This Article {{describes}} {{recent developments}} in moral philosophy on the “second personal standpoint,” and argues {{that they will have}} important ramifications for legal thought. Moral, legal and political thinkers have, for some time now, understood important distinctions between the first personal perspective (of deliberation) and the third personal perspective (of observation, cause and effect), and have plumbed these distinctions to great effect in their thought. This distinction is, in fact, implicit the law and economics movement’s “rational actor” model of decision, which currently dominates much legal academic thought. Recent developments in value theory due to philosopher Stephen Darwall suggest, however, that there is another distinct and irreducible standpoint that we commonly employ in our social interactions: the second personal standpoint. This is the standpoint from which we address one another with claims and grievances, or respond to such claims with apology, excuse or justification. The standpoint employs a distinctive grammatical person, which is as old as our specifically-human capacities for language, and which allows us to ask and answer a distinctive class of practical problems. These are inherently relational problems, which concern how to navigate, manage, repair—and sometimes dissolve—important human relationships. This Article begins by identifying distinctive features of the second personal standpoint. It then illustrates the potential reach of these new developments for legal theory with three examples. Specifically, these developments might help us better diagnose problems that a number of other legal theorists have recently been raising, including, (1) the potential loss involved with silencing criminal defendants (Natapoff), (2) the potential loss inherent in moving from traditional common law uses of precedent to more formalistic approaches (Tiersma), and (3) the inability of economic theories to capture important aspects of <b>tort</b> law’s <b>duty</b> of care (Coleman, Perry, Weinrib). The Article then turns to its central thesis, which is stated in deliberately provocative terms: these new developments will allow us to decipher Hart’s undeveloped but inchoately understood response to exclusive legal positivism, thereby clarifying important aspects of the genuine relationship between law and morality. According to received views, Hart involved himself in inconsistency when he absorbed Raz’s important observations about legal authority into his own jurisprudence. This Article argues, to the contrary, that Hart sensed there was no genuine inconsistency, and for roughly the right reasons. What Hart lacked—and what we have all lacked until now—is a clear account of the second personal standpoint in order to develop and articulate this sense. Using contemporary work, this Article develops a more robust account of legal authority and legal obligation, and defends it against concerns raised by Raz and Shapiro. It argues that Hart would (or at least should) have acknowledged this account as an appropriate elaboration of his views, and as representing the best available framework from within which to further refine legal positivist doctrine. The account should be of independent interest Dworkineans, and other non-positivists, as well, because it suggests that we cannot ultimately resolve these debates on the basis of facts about of legal authority...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing and {{virtually}} unchallenged doctrinal rule provides that a liability insurance carrier owes no <b>duties</b> in <b>tort</b> or contract to a third-party claimant {{who has been}} injured by its insured. As a matter of doctinal consistency and logic, the traditional rule makes some sense. The liability insurer has no contractual relationship with the claimant, and third-party beneficiary doctrine is not easily used to impose duties. Moreover, by stepping into the shoes of the insured tortfeasor to whom it owes a heightened duty of good faith, the insurer is in an adversarial relationship with the claimant {{that makes it difficult}} to argue that the insurer also owes a duty of good faith and fair dealing to the claimant. Nevertheless, liability insurers can compound the injuries suffered by claimants by refusing to make prompt and fair payments for injuries suffered. For a brief time, the infamous Royal Globe decision provided a cause of action to claimants in California, but the decision was prospectively overruled only nine years later. I contend that Royal Globe was misconceived because it was premised on questionable statutory interpretation, leading to an impossible task for lower courts to articulate the details of a private right of action in the language of a regulatory statute. However, the clearly articulated public policy that injured parties receive compensation from insurers suggests that the motivations of the Royal Globe court were basically sound. I argue that courts should address the problem of 2 ̆ 2 reverse insurance fraud 2 ̆ 2 - in which a liability insurer stonewalls payment to a third-party claimant in bad faith, which is to say solely for the purpose of minimizing its payments on the claim and without any legal justification relating to questions of liability or the measure of damages - by focusing on the public policy in issue. My thesis is that courts should award tort damages to third-party claimants only in those cases where the public interest in prompt and fair payment to injured parties is undermined by the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s conduct. In making this case, I analogize to the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy in the employment law setting, where courts have held that employers should be liable in tort if they discharge employees for reasons that offend public policy, even if the employer owes no <b>tort</b> or contract <b>duties</b> regarding the duration of employment. I conclude that courts should similarly recognize the tort of bad faith settlement practices in violation of public policy, even if they continue to adhere to the baseline common law rule that a liability insurer owes no duties directly to third-party claimants. I conclude the article with an appendix that includes a hypothetical judicial opinion that embraces my doctrinal argument. This article was solicited for inclusion in a Symposium published by the Nevada Law Journal on the topic, 2 ̆ 2 My Favorite Insurance Law Case, 2 ̆ 2 and so I took the liberty of creating my own court opinion for purposes of the Symposium...|$|R
40|$|Corruption is {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} pivotal issue on which, depending on their response to it, societies rise, decline, or (even) collapse. Accounting’s 10 millennia role in generating trust and information for decision makers makes it a natural social institution for suppressing corruption or at least mitigating its harm. Corruption, a furtive act (needing darkness, deception, denial and treachery), is incompatible with good accountability, {{because it does not}} long survive exposure of its infidelity, betrayals and defalcations. However, accounting has few effective anti-corruption tools and (as many studies show) accountants are themselves subject to being corrupted. While much has been written on corruption and its consequences, accounting studies on corruption have mostly either relied on extant definitions of corruption or focused on how some accountants have betrayed the trust of their clients and profession by facilitating the corrupt. After reviewing such well-trod paths, this thesis uses a mixed-methods research approach to: 1) consider why accounting and other control measures have tended to be ineffective after centuries, if not millennia, of application; 2) re-examine corruption from a first-principles perspective; 3) evaluate the socio-economic harm generated across a range of corruption (i. e. is corruption ever beneficial or trivial?); 4) propose a shift in the extant corruption paradigm, as a means to make the anti-corruption efforts of accountants and others more cost-effective. While morality and ethics are vital considerations in any review of corruption, they are too culturally and context sensitive to yield an unambiguous definition of corruption, needed to shape and form operational anti-corruption efforts. Efforts to contain corruption via tools arising from extant definitions and/or legal semantics are all too often a day late and a dollar short. In its review of the literature on corruption, this study found that all the reviewed definitions of corruption focus on attributes of the perpetrators of corruption, most include the intent to obtain a self-regarding wrongful gain, and many are restricted to public office. This thesis contends that the current paradigm of corruption imposes attributes on the corruption definitions that unnecessarily make prosecution of the corrupt nearly impossible, unless those who are being prosecuted are inept or very unlucky. This thesis proposes a new paradigm of corruption where the focus is on victims of corruption—in particular, on the harm they suffer {{as a result of a}} breached duty of care. This paradigm fits corruption within the <b>tort</b> breach of <b>duty</b> of care and proof of that tort rest on three legs that are individually necessary and, in combination, sufficient to define any and all types of corruption. This paradigm side-steps the emotive and cultural baggage found in most definitions of corruption and, as such, gives a focus to attack this ancient social evil at its root, instead of the thousands of current attacks on its branches, twigs, and leaves. Social attitudes to corruption range from tolerance to revulsion. This study seeks to focus the struggle against corruption by using quantitative analyses of the output and indices from a range of studies to count the socio-economic cost of corruption and to illustrate how it always harms society. The analysis suggests that businesses use a variety of ways to ameliorate the harm of corruption, however, those means are never fully effective, and the cumulative effects of their competitive bidding for the services of the corrupt eventually precipitate multiple cascading failures in the infrastructure and foundations of society. This study suggests that an accounting of the socio-economic consequences of corruption should include measures of: increased violence, reduced satisfaction with life, and reduced growth, all of which perpetuate or deepen poverty. Thus, corruption despoils the means to increase and maintain wealth and social well-being. Six cases were developed to test the proposed paradigm. It was found that if the new paradigm had been applied, the corruption in the case would have been cleaned with little or no effort by the government or its institutions—also, the deterrent effect on those considering a gain from corruption would likely be greater than the current anticorruption approach. This study concludes that corruption can be cost-effectively resolved if a new paradigm of corruption is developed where corruption is seen as a breach of a duty-of-care and the civil courts are used to impose retribution on the guilty and provide their victims with restitution...|$|R
