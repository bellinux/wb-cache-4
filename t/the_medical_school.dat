40|$|To {{investigate}} the present status of nutrition education for dentists and physicians in Canada, {{we conducted a}} survey of the nutrition education programs in 10 Canadian dental and 16 <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> in <b>the</b> academic year 1982 - 83. Seven of the dental schools and seven of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> had a separate course in nutrition. The average duration of these courses was 22 hours for the dental schools and 26 hours for <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> Nutrition education was integrated with another discipline in 4 of the dental schools and 11 of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> <b>The</b> average duration of this type of instruction was 14 hours for the dental schools and 18 hours for <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> Six of <b>the</b> dental schools and eight of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> employed a nutritionist/dietitian to provide instruction in nutrition. We recommend that courses in basic and applied clinical nutrition be incorporated throughout the curricula of Canadian dental and <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> and that personnel trained in clinical nutrition be employed to provide instruction in this area...|$|R

5|$|Early medieval {{gardens in}} Islamic Spain resembled botanic gardens of the future, an example being the 11th-century Huerta del Ray garden of {{physician}} and author Ibn Wafid (999–1075 CE) in Toledo.

Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville, most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included Morocco, Persia, Sicily, and Egypt. <b>The</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> of Montpelier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians, and by 1250 CE, it included a physic garden, but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E
