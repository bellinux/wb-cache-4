At age 19, already showing signs of <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> a cognitive-behavioral therapist, {{he forced himself to}} talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens over a period of a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.|$|E

25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the assets}} the Custodian {{controlled}} only became clear over the next year. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth $500 million. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth $300 million awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, glycerin for explosives, charcoal for gas masks. Others ranged from mines to brewing to newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise {{as well as an}} investigative bureau to track down well-hidden assets. Below the top-level positions, he distributed jobs as patronage. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the Democratic National Committee to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice-president of a shipping line. Always <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> a politician, he made sure his group's efforts were well publicized.|$|E
500|$|Dahl {{rejects the}} notion that {{prejudice}} was his motivation for the event. [...] "The worst thing is people calling Disco Demolition homophobic or racist. It just wasn't... We weren't <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] In a 2014 op-ed for Crain's Chicago Business, Dahl again took issue with {{the view that the}} event reflected homophobic or racist attitudes, defining Disco Demolition as [...] "a romp, not of major cultural significance." [...] The event's misunderstood historical relevance he blamed on [...] "the lens of 1996 sensibilities" [...] that framed the 1996 mini-series [...] "" [...] after Dahl missed a scheduled interview with VH1 producers.|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|The Indonesian {{island of}} Java, {{run by the}} Srivijaya dynasty of Sumatra from the 7thcentury, partly practised Hinduism. This {{included}} transmission and adoption of the Mahabharata traditions. [...] "The earliest evidence of the penetration of the Sanskrit epics into rural areas {{is found in the}} Sangsang copper plate inscription issued in the name of King Balitung in AD907." [...] A [...] "rendering of the Mahābhārata (IAST original) into Javanese was undertaken under the patronage of King Dharmawangśa Tĕguh (AD 990–1016)", culminating in [...] "a recital of the Wirāṭaparwa for 'one month minus one evening'—commencing on 14 October and ending on 12 November 996." [...] This first translation into Javanese was [...] "abbreviated" [...] and in [...] "prose". However, East Javanese poets later started producing native metered kakawin, expanding on themes from the parvas ("books" [...] or [...] "chapters") of the Mahabharata, and freely importing these into Javanese settings. Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder commented: [...] "These men and women with their Indian names are essentially Javanese, acting like Javanese, <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> Javanese and living in a Javanese environment." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E

[...] It has been noted that British punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist reggae genre as well as the more pro-gay new romantics movement.

Krum assessed the situation and estimated that he could not repulse the enemy and offered peace, which Nicephorus haughtily rejected. Theophanes wrote that the Emperor, [...] "was deterred from his own ill thoughts and the suggestions of his advisors who were <b>thinking</b> <b>like</b> him". Some of his military chiefs considered the invasion of Bulgaria to be imprudent and too risky, but Nicephorus was convinced of his ultimate success.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Van Til's {{application}} of the doctrines of total depravity and the ultimate authority of God led to his reforming of the discipline of apologetics. Specifically, he denied neutrality {{on the basis of}} the total depravity of man and the invasive effects of sin on man's reasoning ability and he insisted that the Bible, which he viewed as a divinely inspired book, be trusted preeminently because he believed the Christian's ultimate commitment must rest on the ultimate authority of God. As Frame says elsewhere, [...] "the foundation of Van Til's system and its most persuasive principle" [...] is a rejection of autonomy since [...] "Christian <b>thinking,</b> <b>like</b> all of the Christian life, is subject to God's lordship". However, it is this very feature that has caused some Christian apologists to reject Van Til's approach. For instance, D. R.
