5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota is {{the second}} northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska).

It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With , or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States, Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ {{stated that}} they would {{discontinue}} Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company had never made a profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, {{it would have been}} profitable.|$|E

5|$|Orford Castle {{was given}} to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now {{maintained}} by English Heritage. The keep of the castle is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks, however, are not medieval, but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally. Archaeological work to understand the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, {{it was originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms {{on the ground floor}} and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{region that}} is {{predominantly}} {{given over to}} crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep {{play an important role}} not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E

5|$|This {{area that}} is located south of the bathing complex, but no visible remains are left. According to a {{reconstruction}} of the site, this complex consisted of the complex of Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari and the pool complex of Garjitawati with several pavilions and a garden. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex that is still protected. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan, or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines. In {{the middle of the}} building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with water flowing beneath it. There was also a kitchen, a looming room, a storage, two pools for the servants, and a garden.|$|E
5|$|This was {{virtually}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Front, during the Phoney War, {{where there was}} significant aerial activity {{in the early months}} of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E

5|$|Capturing Fort Budapest fell {{within the}} {{responsibility}} of the Port Said Sector, an Egyptian military command independent of the Second Field Army to the south. The commander of the sector, Major General Omar Khalid, assigned the task of capturing the fort to the 135th Independent Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Salah 'Abd el-Halim. The 135th was also tasked with capturing another position, Fort Orkal, so Salah committed one battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ali al-Mezahi to capture Budapest. However, Salah had the following reinforcements: six obsolete T-34 tanks equipped with mine flails to breach the Israeli minefield, eight amphibious armored vehicles, a 120 mm mortar company, and a company of the 128th Sa'iqa Group (Sa'iqa, meaning lightning, were Egyptian commando forces). The Sa'iqa company would join the attack via a naval landing and would be separated into two groups. One group would land four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate it and prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort. The other group would land one kilometer east of Budapest, and then attack the fort. The main assault would come from the west, to be carried out by the battalion and the six tanks. The battalion would attack from Port Fouad, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinai under Egyptian control.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames {{that did not have}} one. It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
