Of course, this increases the overall noise level in the bar, and every other patron has to talk louder too (this is equivalent to power control runaway). Eventually, everyone has to shout to make themselves heard by a person standing right beside them, and it is impossible to communicate with anyone more than half a meter away. (In general, however, a human is very capable of filtering out loud sounds; similar techniques can be deployed in signal processing where suitable criteria for distinguishing between signals can be established, see signal processing and notably adaptive signal processing.) ...|$|E

In both cases, the game is over and will not be repeated. What will you do?

40|$|Consider the following: You, a Maine resident, {{and your}} friend, a Massachusetts resident, have {{gone for a}} weekend trout fishing trip to Acadia National Park in Downeast Maine. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> happily {{catching}} trout, and then each of you hook a bass and reel it in. Keeping the bass is illegal under Maine law but not banned by the National Park. Along comes a Maine game warden, who spies {{the two of you}} and cites only you with a fine for catching and keeping the bass. The warden says nothing to the Massachusetts resident who continues to fish, catching and keeping trout and bass, unmolested and without having his pockets lightened. A humorous scenario. Yet, an analogous enforcement dissonance is the norm in federal waters off of the coast of Maine with much larger consequences. The United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world with 3. 4 million square miles of ocean. This vast swath of ocean helps support a $ 24 billion dollar domestic fisheries industry. The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is a crustacean found in the Western North Atlantic. This species of lobster ranges along the coast from Labrador, Canada to Virginia, and within the EEZ, out along the outer continental shelf and slope, the lobster ranges from Georges Bank to North Carolina. The lobster has very valuable and delicious meat contained in its tail and claws and is the focus of an economically important fishery in the Northeast United States, including in the EEZ off of Maine. Yet, in the EEZ, there are some seemingly unfair fishing practices occurring. In the same waters, non-Maine fishermen are allowed to keep and sell lobsters caught as a result of dragging bycatch whereas Maine fishermen are not. This creates an inequitable economic advantage for out of state fishermen, pushes valuable fishery dollars out of Maine, and results in a lack of uniformity in fisheries conservation enforcement. In 2010, in State v. Thomas, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, correctly adjudged that this issue is one for the legislature and not for the courts. Defendant Thomas was caught in the net of this patchwork fisheries law. This Note will examine the relevant law, discuss the Law Court’s decision in State v. Thomas, and suggest possible approaches the Maine legislature could take to resolve the issue...|$|E

The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage.

Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only see <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here.

As I was reading, I had a lot of questions and remarks. I try to summarize them here – while many are still left on the margins of the original manuscript. Let me first explain the way that I have framed my response. First of all, from now on, I will address you, Eugene and Kiyo, directly, instead of addressing your concepts impersonally and talking about you in the third person.

In around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote, [...] "Open when the enemy comes" [...] on the envelope. Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read, [...] "If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle." [...] They were confused after reading the letter. Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian, [...] "Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for.

40|$|As {{you enter}} {{into one of}} life’s most {{important}} decisions, we wish you the best. Marriage is a serious life commitment and should be taken as seriously as a commitment for life. Right now you are very much in love. One secret to a happy marriage is to stay that way. Always put your partner’s needs before your own. If each one is looking out for the other first, then marriage succeeds. Not only are you lovers, but you are best friends and partners throughout a lifetime of happy times, sad times, difficult times, rich times, and maybe poor times but you always have someone {{to go through it}} with you. The key to getting through all of the ups and downs is to remember the love you share for one another. May you find information in this booklet that will give you practical insights into creating and building a happy, healthy marriage. This booklet has been designed to share information with you that has been gathered from extensive research about the kinds of things people do that lead to a successful marriage. Some things you may already know but some may be new and helpful ideas to put into practice. We hope you will use this booklet as a helpful reference to keep lines of communication open. Marriage is something we learn and get better at every day. There is always something new to put into practice to help make your relationship stronger. The best advice I could share with newlyweds is to always put God first in your marriage and in your home. We have done that and He has truly blessed us with a strong, happy marriage for forty-six years. We were also blessed with four sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. Whether your family is two or fifteen, may you feel richly blessed as well.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} aimed to compare the growth indices in 2 years old children {{with a history of}} low birth weight with normal birth weight children. Methods: Current retrospective cohort study on all two-year children with low birth weight and three times the normal weight children covered by health centers of Kahnooj, was conducted in 2015. Cares at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months of age were studied and, child growth indices (weight, height, head circumference), along with some demographic variables were studied. Information were entered SPSS version 20 and the analysis was performed. Results: There were significant differences in children's growth of both groups in all periods of care. Despite the same slope, growth pattern in children showed a significant difference. Young mother, girl sex of baby and preterm birth are predictor factors of low birth weight. Conclusion: Trends and growth patterns of weight, height and head circumference in underweight children have significant difference with normal children and, despite the same slope, these children can not compensate for the backwardness of its growth to <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>two.</b> So <b>you</b> need to plot separate growth curves for these children and, possible preventive measures should be taken to prevent bearing underweight baby. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Science and Values: Global Perspectives track. Analyses of migration and trafficking focus on the flow of persons from poorer to wealthier countries. In relation to health care, these accounts emphasize either the drain of resources from poorer countries, as skilled medical personnel migrate to developed economies, or the burden placed on developed economies by the immigration of disadvantaged populations. Medical tourism, in which the flow of persons is reversed, raises a different and even more critical set of ethical difficulties at the juncture of medicine, mobility, and justice. Typically, medical tourists travel from a wealthy country to a poorer one to obtain medical care at a substantially discounted rate. Agencies market package tours combining medical services in a hospital or clinic with convalescence in a hotel or resort style accommodation. Historically, medical tourism consisted largely of female patient/tourists seeking elective plastic surgeries at a discount. Recently, the numbers of patient/tourists traveling for organ transplants has surged. Reproductive services constitute a booming part of the industry. Bioethics rarely reflects on medical tourism; yet, annually, more than a million Americans alone travel as patient/tourists. Some conventional health insurance companies have begun to market package tours. A growing genre of private companies specializes in medical tourism, matching patients with providers, and arranging travel, accommodation, translation services, and recreational or tourist activities. Studies suggest that the marketing of medical tourism is even more advanced in the UK, than in the US. Health care analysts in the US predict that medical tourism will soon become a structurally integrated part of the delivery system, encouraged as a means of reducing costs. An operation costing $ 30 k in the US costs $ 6 k in Costa Rica, including recuperation on the beach. India’s first for-profit hospital promotes “First-World Health Care at Emerging Market Prices” to an international clientele. Some employers and insurance providers in the US are exploring medical tourism as a low-cost alternative to local care. The government of India, in conjunction with for-profit providers, is now actively pursuing a “subcontracting” relationship with the British National Health Service for the outsourcing of medical care, that is, for shipping British patients to India to receive care. Thus, medical tourism not only shifts resources within the “host” country, from the local population to profit-generating foreigners, but also threatens to undermine guarantees of care in the tourist’s home country. At the same time, countries in Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe have embraced medical tourism as a key element of economic development. In 2003, the Singapore Ministry of Health launched Singapore-Medicine, a “multi-agency government-industry partnership committed to promoting Singapore as a world-class destination for advanced patient care. ” Through Singapore-Medicine, the government’s Economic Development Board collaborates with its Tourism Board to “brand and market” Singapore’s health care services internationally. Singapore plans to attract 1 million medical tourists annually by 2012 and to become a major competitor to well-established markets in South Africa, Thailand, and South America. Recent amendments to Singapore’s Human Organ Transplant Act eliminated the prohibition against payments to living donors. Despite laws against organ trading, Singapore has engaged the worldwide advertising firm DDB to “handle all marketing and advertising communication for its Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) campaign,” and is already attracting foreign clients. Following a similar strategy, the government of India actively promotes collaboration between for-profit health care providers and the tourism industry. Finance Minister Jaswant Singhi’s 2003 budget made the development of India as a “global health destination” official government policy. Medical tourism is frequently identified as India’s most important growth industry. India’s development policy for medical tourism specifically targets “reproductive outsourcing” as a key sector of economic growth. Surrogacy produces nearly $ 500 million a year in revenue in for-profit clinics. Under guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, women recruited as surrogates, who are almost invariably poor and frequently illiterate, sign away, often with a thumbprint, any relation to the children they bear. Policies actively isolate the surrogates from both donors and clients, while children are immediately removed from the surrogate at birth. These practices insure the alienation of the surrogates from the social and generative aspects of pregnancy, reducing them to the status of rented wombs. Marketing strategies in the industry specifically contrast the conditions of surrogacy in the West with the practices of surveillance and confinement to which Indian surrogates are subjected. Frequently, surrogates are housed in hostels attached to for-profit medical clinics, where they are constantly monitored. Clinics advertise the regimens of exercise and diet and the “supervision” by medical personnel to which surrogates submit. One American client remarked, “[In the U. S. ] You have no idea if your surrogate mother is smoking, drinking alcohol, doing drugs. You don’t know what she’s doing. You have a third-party agency as a mediator between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> but there’s no one policing her. ” The ethical difficulties of medical tourism arise from the exploitation of inequities of wealth and power, both between the home and “host” countries and within the “host” country itself. Efforts to employ medical tourism as a form of cost-containment in the US and Britain exemplify the exploitation of social inequity within the home country as well. These policies differentially aggravate the subjection of women, reinforcing their poverty and powerlessness, as well as their status as property. Policies that alienate the surrogate from pregnancy and birth, subject her to surveillance and discipline, and reduce her social relations to an economic calculus constitute a paradigm of the commodification of the body to benefit governmental power and wealth. Some argue that prohibiting or even criticizing payments to poor women in India who serve as surrogates constitutes paternalism, if not imperialism. This argument ignores the effect of these practices in reinforcing the very structural inequities of power and wealth that subject women in the first place. The collaboration of governmental power and economic privilege in the aggressive marketing of the wombs of poor women may provide an isolated, marginal economic gain for a particular woman, but it systematically secures and consolidates her status as property. Similarly, structural inequities are reinforced when medical tourists buy organs in poorer countries, just as gender inequities are intensified when medical tourists travel to Turkey to practice sex selection. My paper argues that medical tourism not only constitutes an “internal drain” on the “host” country’s health care system, comparable to the external drain of personnel and wealth due to immigration, but also that it depends on and reinforces structures of subjection, as well as the systematic disparities of wealth and power that they produce. Whatever wealth results from this industry, there is little, if any, evidence that it ameliorates existing economic and social inequities, while it clearly depends not only on the commodification of the body and the rendering of persons as property, but also on entrenched and historically determined inequities that differentially affect women...|$|R
