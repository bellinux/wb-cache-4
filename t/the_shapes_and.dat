5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> {{size of a}} small 3 -D crack by microwaves was demonstrated. A component named interference waveform, which is based on the amplitude of the reflection coefficient measured at two different frequencies, was obtained. On the other hand, based on the interference model, a corresponding interference waveform, which can be calculated from <b>the</b> assumed <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> size of a 3 -D crack, was also introduced. By compar ing these two interference waveforms, the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> size of a 3 -D crack was carried out. <b>The</b> <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> size of <b>the</b> crack were estimated well by using the proposed method. ...|$|R

5|$|Menes {{spends time}} meditating prior to unleashing a prayer that affects <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> {{movements}} of the clouds in the sky. The caravan leaves Ulthar that night, shortly before the townspeople notice that all of their cats have gone missing. The townspeople suspect both the old couple and the wanderers, but the innkeeper's son Atal witnesses the felines circling {{the property of the}} cotter. The next morning, the cats have returned to their owners well-fed, but the cotter and his wife have vanished. When the townspeople explore their abandoned house, they discovered nothing more than two skeletons that have been picked clean. The local burgesses, after reviewing the evidence and stories of the townspeople, decide to pass a law that forbids the killing of cats in Ulthar.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. <b>The</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

25|$|The Casimir {{effect can}} be {{understood}} {{by the idea that}} the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second quantized electromagnetic field.

25|$|Democritus, {{along with}} Leucippus and Epicurus, {{proposed}} the earliest views on <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> connectivity of atoms.

Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.|$|E

25|$|Newly bought {{fabric is}} often washed before being cut or sewn. If not pre-washed, {{there is a}} risk of the fabric dyes {{bleeding}} during later washing. Many fabric manufacturers take this into account and have taken steps to prevent color-bleeding. Washing, and subsequently drying, the fabric will also shrink some fabrics, so it is best to do this before cutting the fabric into <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes needed. The fabric must be ironed flat before cutting to prevent creases or wrinkles from altering measurements.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources for}} Bulgarian {{domestic}} use-oriented pottery are the necropoleis at Novi Pazar, Devnya, and Varna. The vessels {{were made with}} a potter's wheel, unlike Slavic practice. Since the 9th century two-story ovens {{were used for the}} annealing of the pottery. The shape and decoration of the early Bulgarian pottery was similar to that found in northern Caucasus, the Crimea, and the shores of the Sea of Azov. The growing exchange with the Byzantine Empire following the adoption of Christianity led to an increase in <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> decorations of the Bulgarian pottery that was unprecedented in the Slavic world.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> {{sizes of}} houses differ {{from state to}} state. Common {{elements}} in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and high ceilings, raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork {{in the house is}} often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room. Mosques have traditionally been based on Javanese architecture. In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers, to a whole garden city, Putrajaya. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates.|$|E

25|$|Mathematicians {{seek out}} {{patterns}} {{and use them}} to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} an {{attempted}} reconstruction of the original melody by Suzanne Haïk-Vantoura, {{on the basis of}} <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> positions of the marks and without any reference to existing melodies, as described in her book La musique de la Bible révélée and her records. That reconstruction assumes the signs represent the degrees of various musical scales, that is individual notes, which puts it at odds with all existing traditions where the signs invariably represent melodic motives; it also takes no account of the existence of older systems of notation, such as the Babylonian and Palestinian systems. Musicologists have rejected her results as dubious and her methodology as flawed.|$|E
25|$|Until the age {{of space}} travel, objects in the {{asteroid}} belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope can resolve {{a small amount of}} detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). Radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of delta-v and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.|$|E
