40|$|The “conversion rate” of spam — the {{probability}} that an unsolicited e-mail will ultimately elicit a “sale ” — underlies the entire spam value proposition. However, our understanding of this critical behavior is quite limited, and the literature lacks any quantitative study concerning its true value. In this paper we present a methodology for measuring the conversion rate of spam. Using a parasitic infiltration of an existing botnet’s infrastructure, we analyze two spam campaigns: one designed to propagate a malware Trojan, the other marketing on-line pharmaceuticals. For nearly a half billion spam e-mails we identify <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>that</b> are successfully delivered, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>that</b> pass through popular anti-spam filters, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>that</b> elicit user visits to the advertised sites, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of “sales” and “infections” produced...|$|R

25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{the expected}} {{value of a}} random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of all <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value {{as the number of}} repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.|$|E
25|$|Another {{equivalent}} {{formulation of}} the same problem involves congruent numbers, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> are areas of right triangles whose three sides are all rational numbers. By multiplying the sides by a common denominator, any congruent number may be transformed into the area of a Pythagorean triangle, from which {{it follows that the}} congruent numbers are exactly the numbers formed by multiplying a congruum by the square of a rational number. Thus, there is no square congruum if and only if the number1 is not a congruent number. Equivalently, it is impossible for a square (the geometric shape) and a right triangle to have both equal areas and all sides commensurate with each other.|$|E

25|$|Because the congrua {{are exactly}} <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> are {{four times the}} area of a Pythagorean triangle, and {{multiplication}} by four does not change whether a number is square, {{the existence of a}} square congruum is equivalent to the existence of a Pythagorean triangle with a square area. It is this variant of the problem that Fermat's proof concerns: he shows {{that there is no such}} triangle. In considering this problem, Fermat was inspired not by Fibonacci but by an edition of Diophantus published by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac. This book described various special right triangles whose areas had forms related to squares, but did not consider the case of areas that were themselves square.|$|E
25|$|The Rado graph {{may also}} be formed by a {{construction}} resembling that for Paley graphs. Take as the vertices of a graph all the prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 4, and connect two vertices by an edge whenever {{one of the two}} numbers is a quadratic residue modulo the other (by quadratic reciprocity and the restriction of the vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4, this is a symmetric relation, so it defines an undirected graph). Then, for any sets U and V, by the Chinese remainder theorem, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> are quadratic resides modulo every prime in U and nonresidues modulo every prime in V form a periodic sequence, so by Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions this number-theoretic graph has the extension property.|$|E
25|$|Intersection graphs: An {{interval}} graph is {{the intersection}} graph {{of a set}} of line segments in the real line. It may be given an adjacency labeling scheme in which the points that are endpoints of line segments are numbered from 1 to 2n and each vertex of the graph is represented by the numbers of the two endpoints of its corresponding interval. With this representation, one may check whether two vertices are adjacent by comparing <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> represent them and verifying that these numbers define overlapping intervals. The same approach works for other geometric intersection graphs including the graphs of bounded boxicity and the circle graphs, and subfamilies of these families such as the distance-hereditary graphs and cographs. However, a geometric intersection graph representation does not always imply the existence of an adjacency labeling scheme, because it may require more than a logarithmic number of bits to specify each geometric object. For instance, representing a graph as a unit disk graph may require exponentially many bits for the coordinates of the disk centers.|$|E

Across the sound, at Redstone Point opposite Fort Huger, two old canal barges had been pushed up onto the mud, protected by sandbags and cotton bales, armed with seven guns, and named Fort Forrest. These were all the guns that would bear on the sound; the southern half of the island, nearest Pamlico Sound, in the direction from which the attack would come, was unprotected. Five other guns did not face Croatan Sound: a battery of two guns on the eastern side of the island protected against possible assault across Roanoke Sound, and three others occupied an earthwork near the geometric center of the island.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that the main Scottish force arrived from the south, rather than from the west or the north. For example, Alexander III is recorded to have been south at Ayr in September, and the power centre of Alexander of Dundonald, Steward of Scotland (d. 1282), who is thought to have commanded the Scottish forces at the battle, was also located to the south. Furthermore, {{at the time of the}} battle, the Sheriff of Ayr was probably a member of the steward's familyprobably his younger brother, the Earl of Menteith. If the Scots had indeed arrived from the south, then they would have also assembled at a muster site to the south, possibly somewhere near Ayr. The saga indicates that the Norwegians were divided into two groups. The smaller force, numbered at 200 men, was stationed on a mound, somewhat inland from the beach, under the command of Norwegian nobleman Ogmund Crouchdance. The main Norwegian force, numbered at about 700 to 800 men (including Haakon himself), was stationed on the beach below. These two detachments were likely only a fraction of the total number of forces at Haakon's disposal. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> the saga allots to either side may be exaggerated. A more likely number may be only about one hundred or several hundred men per side with the number of knights present may have been closer to 50 than the saga's 500.
