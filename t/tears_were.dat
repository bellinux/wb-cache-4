I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E

500|$|Immediately after Cannae, Hannibal sent a {{delegation}} led by Carthalo {{to negotiate a}} peace treaty with the Senate on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead, they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions, enlisting landless peasants and even slaves. So firm were these measures that the word [...] "peace" [...] was prohibited, mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> prohibited even to women. For {{the remainder of the}} war in Italy, they did not amass such large forces under one command against Hannibal; they utilized several independent armies, still outnumbering the Punic forces in numbers of armies and soldiers. The war still had occasional battles, but was focused on taking strongpoints and constant fighting according to the Fabian strategy. This finally forced Hannibal with his shortage of manpower to retreat to Croton from where he was called to Africa for the battle of Zama, ending the war with a complete Roman victory.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of tears: basal tears, {{reflexive}} tears, and psychic <b>tears.</b> Basal <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> produced {{at a rate of}} about 1 to 2 microliters a minute, and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the cornea. Reflexive <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> <b>tears</b> that <b>are</b> made in response to irritants to the eye, such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye. Psychic <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> produced by the lacrimal system and <b>are</b> the <b>tears</b> expelled during emotional states.|$|R
30|$|Most {{rotator cuff}} <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> {{asymptomatic}} [16]. When a SSC tendon lesion is symptomatic, spontaneous or triggered pain is preferentially {{located in the}} anterior region of the shoulder. A <b>tear</b> <b>is</b> painful during development, whereas a constituted <b>tear</b> <b>is</b> less painful, if at all. When subacromial-subdeltoid (SASD) bursitis is associated, pain is common. Calcific tendinitis can also be painful, especially when hydroxyapatite calcifications are in the resorptive phase [17].|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} common causes of a meniscal <b>tear</b> <b>are</b> {{traumatic}} injury (often seen in athletes) and degenerative processes, {{which are the}} most common tear seen in all ages of patients. Meniscal tears can occur in all age groups. Traumatic <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> most common in active people aged 10-45. Traumatic <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> usually radial or vertical in the meniscus and more likely to produce a moveable fragment that can catch in the knee and therefore require surgical treatment.|$|R

50|$|Degenerative <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> {{most common}} in people from age 40 upward but {{can be found at}} any age, {{especially}} with obesity. Degenerative meniscal <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> thought to occur as part of the aging process when the collagen fibers within the meniscus start to break down and lend less support to the structure of the meniscus. Degenerative <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> usually horizontal, producing both an upper and a lower segment of the meniscus. These segments do not usually move out of place and are therefore less likely to produce mechanical symptoms of catching or locking.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the recent}} past, small <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an open procedure. [...] Advances in {{arthroscopy}} now allow arthroscopic repair {{of even the}} largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. [...] The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although significant differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use apparently are not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgical patients.|$|E

One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the Jonestown massacre.

While Muskie's campaign funding and support dried up, McGovern picked up valuable momentum in the following months.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{study in}} the Journal of Orthopaedics the {{prevalence}} of a rotator cuff tear was considerably greater in males than in females within the ages of 50–60 years old, within the ages of 70–80 years old there wasn’t much difference in prevalence. The data of this study showed that the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear in the general population is 22.1% [...] Yamamoto et al. performed a medical examination on 683 people whom live in a mountain village.

40|$|The {{meniscus}} is a disc of cartilage {{located between}} the femur and tibia {{that acts as}} a cushion to redistribute the forces in the knee joint. Meniscal tears may result from an acute, traumatic injury to a young, healthy knee.

Symptoms of a torn meniscus include pain, especially going up stairs, swelling of the knee, locking or clicking. Meniscal <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed by physical exam or MRI.

2500|$|Over the years, Susan Lucci {{became known}} for gaining Daytime Emmy Award {{nominations}} for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning.

Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding her fist {{on the table and}} leaving one ceremony in <b>tears,</b> <b>were</b> mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to All My Children newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, [...] "It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn't win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled." [...] She later added, [...] "It was {{a slap in the face}} to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role." [...] The losing streak became a [...] "long-running gag" [...] in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show used it as a joke as did Saturday Night Live. The author of The Emmy, Tom O'Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. [...] "In the episodes she sent in last year, she was crying 75 percent of the time," [...] he said. [...] "She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, [...] "Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better."
