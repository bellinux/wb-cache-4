Gilbert concluded that Maybe <b>This</b> <b>Christmas</b> Too? [...] "feels just about right" [...] and [...] "does a fine job of representing the less than stellar aspects of a wintry, commercialized holiday like Christmas." [...] In 2008 The A.V. Club included [...] "Spotlight on Christmas" [...] as number thirty-nine on its list of [...] "42 holiday entertainments that don't make us want to claw our eyes out with rage".|$|E
