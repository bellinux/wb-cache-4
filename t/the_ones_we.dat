25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> now possess come to us. The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E

These included the commanding officers of both the 47th and 15th Regiments. Of the Australian force that had launched the attack, almost half became casualties.

500|$|Proposals {{that one}} type of animal, even humans, could descend from other types of animals, are known {{to go back to}} the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers. Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610 – 546 BC) {{proposed}} that the first animals lived in water, during a wet phase of the Earth's past, and that the first land-dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water, and only spent part of their life on land. He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different type of animal, because man needs prolonged nursing to live. Empedocles (c. 490 – 430 BC), argued that what we call birth and death in animals are just the mingling and separations of elements which cause the countless [...] "tribes of mortal things." [...] Specifically, the first animals and plants were like disjointed parts of <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> see today, some of which survived by joining in different combinations, and then intermixing during the development of the embryo, and where [...] "everything turned out as it would have if it were on purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way." [...] Other philosophers who became more influential in the Middle Ages, including Plato (c. 428/427 – 348/347 BC), Aristotle (384 – 322 BC), and members of the Stoic school of philosophy, believed that the types of all things, not only living things, were fixed by divine design.|$|E

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> need to read and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> don't. In our work environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction {{is one of the best}} tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns" ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the bulk}} of {{material}} in any star is hydrogen and helium, {{there is a significant}} variation in the amount of heavier elements (metals). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy material initially available in the protoplanetary disk. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the solar nebula theory of planetary system formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. Spectroscopic studies of systems where exoplanets have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: [...] "Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions." [...] This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems {{are more likely to be}} found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the universe's history have low metal content.|$|E
2500|$|The experiential {{pattern in}} nominal groups opens with the {{identification}} of the head in terms of the [...] immediate context of the speech event—the here-and-now—what Halliday calls [...] "the speaker–now matrix". Take, for example, the first word of the nominal group exemplified above: [...] "those": [...] "those apples", as opposed to [...] "these apples", means [...] "you know the apples I mean—the ones over there, not close to me"; distance or proximity to the immediate speech event could also be in temporal terms (<b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> picked last week, not today), or in terms of the surrounding text (the apples mentioned in the previous paragraph in another context, not in the previous sentence in the same context as now) and the assumed background knowledge of the listener/speaker ("the apple" [...] as opposed to [...] "an apple" [...] means [...] "the one you know about"). The same function is true of other deictics, such as [...] "my", [...] "all", [...] "each", [...] "no", [...] "some", and [...] "either": they establish the relevance of the head—they [...] "fix" [...] it, as it were—in terms of the speech event.|$|E

While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that [...] "the way that [...] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming." [...] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful— namely, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>we</b> already have and don't wish to expand."
