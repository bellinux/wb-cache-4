5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the US oil {{marketing}} hub at Cushing {{was flooded}} with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media {{as the price of}} oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.|$|E

One of the hits in question came off the bat of Daiei leadoff man Akiyama, who cranked his first home run of the series at the start of the 6th.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued, {{partly on the}} grounds that no decent {{solution}} to the measurement problem seems to be forthcoming, and partly on the grounds of recent results from quantum information theory, that measurement in quantum theory is best treated as a black box, and quantum theory itself is best treated as a theory of information and computation. I agree with the premises of the argument, but not the conclusion. In particular, there is a crucial difference between ‘having no account of measurement’ and ‘having no complete account of measurement that is entirely internal to the theory’ (i. e., having no solution to the measurement problem). In fact, we know quite a bit about measurements. In this paper, I will argue that taking into account some of what we know about measurements—in particular, the role of reference frames in measurements—sheds some light on quantum theory as a theory of information and computation. In fact, the recently proposed ‘one-way quantnum computation ’ scheme takes on a new character in light of the role that reference frames must play in the actually carrying out of any one-way quantum comptuation. 1 The ‘black-box ’ view of measurement Measurement has often been treated as a ‘black-box ’ in quantum theory. In partic-ular, one (if one is a philosopher!) very seldom worries about the physics of a given measurement. Instead, we characterize measurements in terms of some operator on a Hilbert space, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>there...</b>|$|E
