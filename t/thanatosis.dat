Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes advantage of these markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence.|$|E
500|$|Large ground-dwelling beetles such as Carabidae, the {{rhinoceros}} beetle and the longhorn beetles {{defend themselves}} using strong mandibles, or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators.

Some combine it with <b>thanatosis,</b> in which they close up their appendages and [...] "play dead". The click beetles (Elateridae) can suddenly catapult themselves out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum.|$|E
2500|$|Nests {{are built}} between rocks, in holes in walls or {{in a tree}} hollow. Nests are lined with animal hair {{and it has been}} noted that many nests have pieces of snake sloughs. The eggs are of regular oval form, but many are {{elongated}} and a few pointed. They have a fair amount of gloss. The ground-colour is white, often tinged with faint green or pink, and this is rather closely spotted, speckled, streaked, and mottled, with rich reddish or umber-brown and brownish yellow, with some underlying lavender. The markings are denser at the larger end of the egg, where they form an irregular cap. Some eggs are blotched with dark reddish brown at the large end. Eggs are about [...] long and [...] wide. Three to four eggs is the usual clutch. An abnormal clutch of seven has been noted although none of the eggs hatched at this nest. Only the female incubates. Eggs hatch in about 10–12 days. Chicks have black down. Both males and females feed the young, the males sometimes passing food to the female which in turn feeds the young. Nestlings may feign dead (<b>thanatosis)</b> when handled. Nestlings may be preyed on by the rufous treepie. The same nest site may be reused in subsequent years.|$|E

5000|$|Another pursuit-deterrent {{signal is}} <b>thanatosis</b> or playing dead. <b>Thanatosis</b> {{is a form}} of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being {{attacked}} by predators seeking live prey. <b>Thanatosis</b> can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as [...] "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the [...] "dead" [...] prey. Additionally, other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, including salivation, urination, and defecation, can cause the predator to lose interest.|$|E
50|$|In beetles, {{artificial}} selection experiments {{have shown that}} there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced, which suggests that <b>thanatosis</b> is indeed adaptive.|$|E

50|$|In {{the spider}} species Pisaura mirabilis, male spiders often stage {{elaborate}} rituals of gift-giving and <b>thanatosis</b> {{to avoid getting}} eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.|$|E
5000|$|Males of {{this species}} offer a nuptial gift to {{potential}} female mates. Some Pisaura mirabilis specimens have also been observed to use <b>thanatosis</b> during courtship. After presenting the nuptial gift to the female, she bites on to the gift and the male moves to her epigyne to deposit sperm with his pedipalps. Throughout copulation, the male keeps a leg on the gift {{so as to be}} ready if she tries to escape with it or attack him. At this time, the male may feign death [...] - [...] his limbs become straight and he is dragged along with the female while holding on to the gift. When the female stops, the male slowly [...] "resurrects" [...] and continues attempting to mate. <b>Thanatosis</b> in P. mirabilis has been observed to significantly increase the male's odds of successfully copulating from less than 30% to 89%.|$|E
50|$|The genus can be {{diagnosed}} among wingless cryptorhynchine weevils {{by the absence}} of a metanepisternum and by a synapomorphic structure of the tarsus with minute claws and a deeply incavated articulation of tarsomere 4. The metathoracic spiracle located externally {{at the side of the}} metaventrite is a unique feature and may ensure sufficient respiration during <b>thanatosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{also have}} similar {{defensive}} behavior as Progradungula carraiensis. During low-level disturbances, they retreat towards the upper support webs or dismount towards the nearest surface. In greater threat levels, however, they immediately drop from their webs {{to the ground}} and [...] "play dead" [...] (<b>thanatosis),</b> assuming an inert posture with their legs tightly held against their bodies.|$|E
50|$|Trigonopterus species inhabit primary {{tropical}} forests, both on {{foliage and}} edaphic in the litter layer. They have a marked tendency to endemism with many species only known {{from a single}} locality. Their primary defence against predators is apparent death or <b>thanatosis.</b> An animated 3D model of a Trigonopterus weevil reveals a number of mechanisms to maintain a stable defensive position.|$|E
50|$|Apparent death, colloquially {{known as}} playing dead, feigning death, or playing possum, is a {{behavior}} {{in which an}} animal takes on the appearance of being dead.

50|$|Samedi: A loathsome necromantic {{bloodline}} {{arising from}} the Caribbean, being embraced by the Samedi literally causes the victim to appear as a walking corpse. One of the few vampires as horrendous as the Nosferatu, the Samedi practice necromancy and a special Discipline called <b>Thanatosis</b> which they use to weaken or cause death in others. Samedi exist in small numbers in both sects or as independents.|$|E
5000|$|Not being venomous, the snake's only defence is {{to produce}} a garlic-smelling fluid from the anal glands, or to feign death (<b>thanatosis)</b> by {{becoming}} completely limp. [...] They may also perform an aggressive display in defence, hissing and striking without opening the mouth. They rarely bite in defence. They may also secrete blood (autohaemorrhage) from the mouth and nose whilst playing dead. When caught they often regurgitate the contents of their stomachs.|$|E
5000|$|In mammals, the Virginia opossum {{is perhaps}} the best known example of {{defensive}} <b>thanatosis.</b> [...] "Playing possum" [...] is an idiomatic phrase which means [...] "pretending to be dead". It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened. This instinct does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging roadkill may use it {{in response to the}} threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.|$|E
50|$|An adult that senses danger {{displays}} a defense mechanism, <b>thanatosis,</b> becoming motionless, folding up its appendages and falling with its black under surface facing up, thereby helping it camouflage {{with the ground}} to get away. If unable to escape, they are also able to ‘squeak’, by rubbing two parts of their body together, which {{may be used to}} startle the attacker. This process is known as stridulation and could even shock a bird or any other predator that may attack the lily leaf beetle.|$|E

5000|$|In animal behaviour, <b>thanatosis</b> (from the Greek noun θανάτωσις meaning [...] "putting to death") is {{the process}} by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a prey evading a {{predator}}, a male trying to mate with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The French biologist Georges Pasteur classifies it as a form of self-mimesis, a form of camouflage or mimicry in which the [...] "mimic" [...] imitates itself in a dead state.|$|E

5000|$|Nimbochromis {{is a small}} genus of haplochromine {{cichlids}} mostly {{endemic to}} Lake Malawi in East Africa. They are known as 'sleeper cichlids' or (in Chichewa) kaligono ("sleepers"), due to their unique hunting behavior. In these large predatory fish, <b>thanatosis</b> is expressed {{as a form of}} aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. N. livingstoni then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close. A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid Lamprologus lemairii from Lake Tanganyika [...] and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid Parachromis friedrichsthalii.|$|E
50|$|Species of this genus are {{predominantly}} ground-nesting and, when disturbed, will display <b>thanatosis</b> enhanced by crypsis, i.e., individuals will accumulate dirt in their pilosity and play dead. With respect to diet, most species are omnivores and facultative granivores, while others, including the whole M. diversus species group, are specialist granivores. At least one species, the Malaysian rainforest-dwelling M. mucronatus {{is known to}} have a trophobiotic relationship with hemipterans. Meranoplus species are known to be active both day and night, and to recruit via pheromone trails laid {{from the base of the}} sting using secretions from their extremely large Dufour glands. The function of the spatulate sting is still unknown. The only species of Meranoplus for which mating has been reported is M. peringuiyi, in which mating swarms occurred after a rain and where males patrolled for the outnumbered females in a zig-zag manner.|$|E
50|$|Hemiptera form prey to predators {{including}} vertebrates, such as birds, {{and other}} invertebrates such as ladybirds. In response, hemipterans have evolved antipredator adaptations. Ranatra may feign death (<b>thanatosis).</b> Others such as Carpocoris purpureipennis secrete toxic fluids {{to ward off}} arthropod predators; some Pentatomidae such as Dolycoris are able to direct these fluids at an attacker. Toxic cardenolide compounds are accumulated by the heteropteran Oncopeltus fasciatus when it consumes milkweeds, while the coreid stinkbug Amorbus rubiginosus acquires 2-hexenal from its food plant, Eucalyptus. Some long-legged bugs mimic twigs, rocking to and fro to simulate the motion of a plant part in the wind. The nymph of the Masked hunter bug camouflages itself with sand grains, using its hind legs and tarsal fan to form a double layer of grains, coarser on the outside. The Amazon rain forest cicada Hemisciera maculipennis display bright red deimatic flash coloration on their hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. The coloured patch on the hindwing is concealed at rest by an olive green patch {{of the same size}} on the forewing, enabling the insect to switch rapidly from cryptic to deimatic behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is December to September but {{varies according to}} region and usually begins with the first rains. Peak breeding in northern India is in June and is earlier in Southern India. In Sri Lanka it breeds in March to June and August to September. Males sing during this season and display by lowering and spreading their tail feathers and strutting around the female, displaying their sides and fluffing their undertail coverts. The songs of males have variants for inviting mates and for deterring other males. Males will drive away other males and patrol their territory by flying with slow wing-beats from perch to perch. They may sometimes peck at their reflections. An aggressive display involves fluffing up the feathers and holding the bill high.Nests are built between rocks, in holes in walls or in a tree hollow.

40|$|Males {{and females}} often {{experience}} different optima in mating rate, which may cause evolution of female resistance to matings and male counter adaptations to increase mating rate. Males {{of the spider}} Pisaura mirabilis display a spectacular mating behavior involving a nuptial gift and <b>thanatosis</b> (death feigning). <b>Thanatosis</b> in a sexual context is exceptional and was suggested to function as an antipredation strategy toward potentially cannibalistic females. If <b>thanatosis</b> serves as a protection strategy, males should death feign in response to female aggression or when they are more vulnerable to attack. We tested these predictions in a factorial design: males that were handicapped (1 leg removed) and hence vulnerable and control males were paired with females that {{were more or less}} aggressive intrinsically (measured toward prey). In mating trials, we recorded the tendency of males to death feign, copulation success, and copulation duration. In addition, we investigated the effect of female mating status (virgin or mated) on these male mating components. Intrinsically aggressive females showed increased mating aggression toward males. Neither female aggressiveness, mating status, nor male vulnerability increased the propensity of males to perform <b>thanatosis.</b> Instead, death-feigning males were more successful in obtaining copulations and gained longer copulations. Hence, our results suggest that <b>thanatosis</b> functions as an adaptive male mating strategy to overcome female resistance. All males were capable of performing <b>thanatosis</b> although some males use it more frequently than others, suggesting a cost of death feigning which maintains the variation in <b>thanatosis</b> during courtship.

40|$|<b>Thanatosis</b> {{behavior}} was tested in 18 individuals of Trichodactylus panoplus, 10 males and 8 females. The crabs were induced into <b>thanatosis</b> in containers {{with and without}} water, and {{the time that they}} remained still was measured. Regardless of gender, 88 % of the individuals remained still while in the dry containers, and 77. 77 % remained still in the water‑filled containers. The overall mean duration of this behavior, including males and females, was 59. 91 seconds in the dry containers, and in water it was 10. 85 seconds. Females remained longer in <b>thanatosis</b> than males in both treatments. We found no significant influence of the size of an animal on the time that it remained still. This behavior is possibly selected for, because it may reduce the rate of predation on the crabs. Key words: animal behavior, death‑feigning, immobility, predation defense, <b>thanatosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Adaptations to captivity {{that reduce}} fitness {{are one of}} many reasons, which explain the low success rate of reintroductions. One way of testing this {{hypothesis}} is to compare an important behavioural response in captive and wild {{members of the same}} species. <b>Thanatosis,</b> is an anti-predator strategy that reduces the risk of death from predation, which is a common behavioral response in frogs. The study subjects for this investigation were captive and wild populations of Mantella aurantiaca. <b>Thanatosis</b> reaction was measured using the Tonic Immobility (TI) test, a method that consists of placing a frog on its back, restraining it in this position {{for a short period of}} time and then releasing it and measuring how much time was spent feigning death. To understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also collected as body condition can affect the duration of <b>thanatosis.</b> The significantly different TI times found in this study, one captive population with shorter responses, were principally an effect of body condition rather than being a result of rearing environment. However, this does not mean that we can always dismiss the importance of rearing environment in terms of behavioural skills expressed...|$|E
