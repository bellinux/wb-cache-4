60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{consented to}} be married in church, {{somewhat}} to Godfrey's surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--not {{definite}} news. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{asked me}} to release her. She and the man both wanted to lead a proper life, as I understood." ...|$|E
60|$|MABEL. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> gave it up. And it didn't really suit her. (Ruminating.) I can't {{think of}} {{a good way of}} doing dear Joanna's hair. What is that you are muttering to yourself, Jack? Don't keep {{anything}} from me.|$|E
50|$|The Judges were {{impressed}} by Yeon-hee's performance and dedication <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> earned the best photo. So-hyun and Na-hyun underperformed and castigated by their photos and sent home.|$|R
60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{missed her}} {{appointment}} with Mr. Richard Frobisher (of the London Mail) {{to go and}} see Maud Allan dance at the Palace Theatre that afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "So!" [...] he cried. [...] "Would <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{refused to}} see me? Did she {{conceive}} that I went perhaps to plead? Could she think that? Could she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he drink?" [...] asked Charlotte gravely. [...] "The matron's husband {{drank and}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> left {{him and took}} to running an orphan asylum. I think I'd rather {{put up with a}} drunken husband than live in an orphan asylum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{and they}} will quite {{understand}} why you say it. My mistress was getting uneasy already, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> drove us from the room. You will tell them that the treasure is buried but that the secret of its hiding-place was lost." ...|$|E
60|$|His little friend Lilybell {{was very}} different, {{for she was}} so kind and good every one loved her. She spent her time trying to undo the {{mischief}} naughty Thistle did, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> followed him now, because she was afraid he would get into trouble and need some one to help him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, my dear boy, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{thinks you}} interesting. To her {{you are a}} mine of splendid possibilities. But I {{understand}} that you don't like either of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. 'I can't quite remember, but I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy {{is to be}} there, my love.' ...|$|R
50|$|Choro-Hajji's wife, Suyumkan Malay kyzy, was a {{daughter}} of a wealthy person from a neighboring Ming-Bulak village. She was educated before the Soviet regime, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> could read the Koran in Arabic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He little {{knew that}} he was {{bringing}} her here to destroy his daughter's happiness. So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> held off from Mr. Hope,' cried Albinia, burning with such indignation, that on some one she must expend it, but a tirade against the artfulness of the little French witch was cut off short by an authoritative-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how glad {{his mother}} must have been," [...] said Una softly. [...] "I {{think she had}} been sorry all her life that he was lame. Perhaps she even used to cry about it. But {{she would never be}} sorry again--never. She would be glad he was lame because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> hadn't lost him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> shrieked and fainted {{when she}} saw the coronet," [...] cried Mr. Holder. [...] "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were {{at the scene of the}} struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nelly," [...] {{returned}} Marian, {{in hushed}} tones of reproach, [...] "you have stabbed poor Constance {{to the heart}} by telling her that Marmaduke never proposed to her. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> has gone out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Moonpaw {{is an old}} hippy woman. She is {{a friend}} of Kaz and Rainbow and runs an esoteric shop {{together}} with Rainbow. Moonpaw has cancer. She <b>is</b> deathly sick, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> can see Annie.(Chasers, Bad Blood) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "So I {{tell you}} that all her sins <b>are</b> forgiven, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> has shown great love. But {{anyone who has been}} forgiven for only a little will show only a little love." [...] (Contemporary English Version) ...|$|R
60|$|And {{after all}} {{what was it}} that Mary and her painter had come out to do? To buy two pork chops. On my honour. She had been trying to persuade him, I decided, that they were living too lavishly. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> sought to draw him back. But in her heart she loves audacity, and that is why she admired him for {{pressing}} forward.|$|E
60|$|Because {{she wished}} to {{goodness}} they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because {{they were told to}} be in early.|$|E
6000|$|... "You insulted her," [...] she {{answered}} sharply. [...] "Irene {{told me all}} about it--she was literally heart-broken. You told her never to speak to you again--and Irene told me she simply could not imagine what she had said or done to deserve such treatment. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> never came to our meetings again but joined in with the Lowbridge Red Cross. I do not blame her in the least, and I, for one, will not ask her to lower herself by helping us out of this scrape." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 Laura got a {{very strange}} illness in her lungs that almost killed her, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> created the musical [...] "Muerte con M de Mujer" [...] which she {{presents}} each November {{as a tribute to}} the death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} you are right," [...] said I, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> waiting for all these days, keeping us bottled up {{so that we could}} not have got away even if we had had a breeze." ...|$|R
50|$|Indrani {{was invited}} {{several times to}} attend the American Bengali Conference and to present kathak dance skills. As Indrani has {{remarkable}} dance skills on kathak, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> now a popular Indian actress cum kathak dancer all over the world.|$|R
60|$|The more he {{knew her}} the more he became {{convinced}} of this birdlike quality in her. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> liked to ride, he argued. It was the nearest approach to flying. A field of poppies, a glen of ferns, a row of poplars on a country lane, the tawny brown of a hillside, the shaft of sunlight on a distant peak--all such were provocative of quick joys which seemed to him like so many outbursts of song. Her joys were in little things, and she seemed always singing. Even in sterner things it was the same. When she rode Bob and fought with that magnificent brute for mastery, the qualities of an eagle were uppermost in her.|$|E
60|$|Her health {{had quite}} {{come back to}} her; indeed, never before had she felt so strong and well. But the very soul had {{withered}} in her breast. All day she thought, and all night she dreamed of the man who, in cold blood, had offered up his life to save a helpless woman and her child. She wondered whether {{he would have done}} this if he had heard the answer that was upon her lips. Perhaps <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had not been given time to speak that answer, which might have made a coward of him. For nothing more had been heard of Robert Seymour; indeed, already the tragedy of the ship Zanzibar was forgotten. The dead had buried their dead, and since then worse disasters had happened in the world.|$|E
60|$|It was borne in upon me {{that somehow}} it was {{different}} now from the old days before Lop-Ear and I had gone on our adventure-journey. I wanted her, and I knew that I wanted her. And she knew it, too. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> would not let me come near her. I forgot that she was truly the Swift One, {{and that in the}} art of climbing she had been my teacher. I pursued her from tree to tree, and ever she eluded me, peeping back at me with kindly eyes, making soft sounds, and dancing and leaping and teetering before me just out of reach. The more she eluded me, the more I wanted to catch her, and the lengthening shadows of the afternoon bore witness to the futility of my effort.|$|E
6000|$|... 'E {{was warned}} agin' 'er-- [...] That's what made 'im look; [...] She was warned agin' 'im-- [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> took. [...] Wouldn't 'ear no reason, [...] Went an' done it blind; [...] We {{know all about}} 'em, [...] They've got all to find! ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Perhaps this {{portrait}} {{of a woman in}} an armchair by Backer seemed more attractive to the sitter mentioned by Sandrart than the portraits by Frans Hals of her Haarlem contemporaries, the Voogt sisters, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> travelled to Amsterdam for her portrait to be done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'E {{was warned}} agin' 'er -- [...] That's what made 'im look; [...] She was warned agin' 'im -- [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> took. [...] 'Wouldn't 'ear no reason, [...] 'Went an' done it blind; [...] We {{know all about}} 'em, [...] They've got all to find! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in words. He {{used to walk}} up {{and down}} on the road when I was at the back window or in the garden, and often hung about the bank of the creek for hours, like some animal. I don't think the others saw him, and when they did they thought it was Parmlee for Euphemia. Even Euphemia thought so too, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was so {{conceited}} and hard to Parmlee towards the end. She thought it was Parmlee that night when Grant and Rice came; but it was 'Lige Curtis who had been watching the window lights in the rain, and who must have gone off at last to speak to you in the store. I always let Phemie believe that it was Parmlee,--it seemed to please her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From him my father, Kanau, got the {{collecting}} bee in his bonnet, and Hiwilani was likewise infected. But {{father was}} modern to his finger-tips. He believed neither in {{the gods of}} the kahunas" [...] (priests) [...] "nor of the missionaries. He didn't believe in anything except sugar stocks, horse-breeding, and that his grandfather had been a fool in not collecting a few Isaac Davises and John Youngs and brass carronades {{before he went to}} war with Kamehameha. So he collected curios in the pure collector's spirit; but my mother took it seriously. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> went in for bones. I remember, too, she had an ugly old stone-idol she used to yammer to and crawl around on the floor before. It's in the Deacon Museum now. I sent it there after her death, and her collection of bones to the Royal Mausoleum in Olokona.|$|E
60|$|Then a week passed. He wrote again, {{and still}} no reply. Then a vague feeling of jealousy took {{possession}} {{of him as}} he remembered her warning hint of the attentions to which she was subjected, and he became singularly appreciative of Snapshot Harry's proficiency as a marksman. Then, cruelest of all, for your impassioned lover is no lover at all if not cruel in his imaginings, he remembered how she had evaded her uncle's espionage with HIM; could she not equally with ANOTHER? Perhaps <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had hurried him away,--why she had prevented his returning to her uncle. Following this came another week of disappointment and equally miserable cynical philosophy, in which he persuaded himself he was perfectly satisfied with his material advancement, {{that it was the}} only outcome of his adventure to be recognized; and he was more miserable than ever.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded and}} handed it to one of his men, who {{departed}} in the direction of our huts. So, thought I to myself, Nombe knows all about this business, which means <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> being worked by Zikali. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> spoke to me as she did last night.|$|R
60|$|ALICE HEMINGWAY. I {{am afraid}} {{he loves her}} very hard. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> here. They had to send her away. Billy was making life miserable for her. They were little {{children}} together--playmates. And Billy has been, well, importunate. And Loretta, poor child, does not know anything about marriage. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> all.|$|R
50|$|And {{if you see}} {{carefully}} in the picture you can see Maa Shoolini, She is in {{the right wing of}} Sharabha ji, She <b>is</b> black color <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> called Saloni, Shool Dharini as She is a form of Maa Kali or Maa Durga. She is also known as Shoolini Durga.|$|R
