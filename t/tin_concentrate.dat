The purpose is the development of a system for an optimum control of a stochastic process of electric smelting of <b>tin</b> <b>concentrates</b> and a practical realization of mathematical models and algorithms to be used for optimizing the furnace temperature conditions. Mathematical models for predicting the process state and determining the control actions with deviations considered have been constructed for electrical smelting <b>tin</b> <b>concentrates</b> for the first time. Methods of a continuous control of the melt levels by the magnetic field strength with the OSF operating have been developed.

The methodological principles of the training system has been in the process of training metal-making engineers.

Broadly speaking, the process involves crushing and sizing, followed by gravity separation on fine material and dense media separation (DMS) on coarse material.

40|$|A novel {{process for}} {{preparing}} direct reduction iron (DRI) and titanium nitride (TiN) from Panzhihua titanomagnetite concentrate is proposed. This process involves pelletizing, direct reduction roasting and magnetic separation. The effects of reduction temperature, coal dosage and reduction {{time on the}} phase transformation of composite pellets were investigated by X-ray diffraction. Results show that TiN formation proceeds less easily than metallic iron formation. Increasing the reduction temperature, reduction time and coal dosage can promote the transformation of titanium to TiN. Titanium was almost completely transformed into TiN under the conditions of 1300 °C reduction temperature, 26 wt % coal dosage and 90 min reduction time. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that near-spherical metallic iron particles with diameters from dozens of microns to about 300 μm were formed in the reduced pellets, whereas the TiN particles generally measured less than 10 μm. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results revealed that the TiN phase contains {{a certain amount of}} vanadium and carbon, and traces of other impurities. The reduced composite pellets under the optimum conditions were processed by grinding and subsequent magnetic separation. As a result, a DRI with 92. 88 wt % Fe, 1. 00 wt % Ti, and 0. 13 wt % V was obtained, and the recoveries of Fe, Ti, and V were 92. 85 wt %, 9. 00 wt %, and 19. 40 wt %, respectively. 91. 00 wt % Ti and 80. 60 wt % V were concentrated in the rough <b>TiN</b> <b>concentrate...</b>|$|E

Most primary indium is recovered from zinc ferrite residues which have been recycled to lead smelters for processing. Efforts to optimise the recovery of indium during lead smelting require {{an understanding of the}} distribution of indium between lead bullion and slag, and of the thermodynamics of indium oxide in slag. In this work, measurements of the indium metal/slag distribution ratio as a function of oxygen partial pressure at 1200 ºC in FeO-CaO-SiO 2 - 8 wt-%Al 2 O 3 slags were used to show that indium exists in these slags as InO. The indium distribution ratio was mapped across the liquid field and found to be dependent on the FeO/SiO 2 ratio but independent of the CaO/SiO 2 ratio, being a maximum in FeO rich slags. This behaviour suggests that InO behaves as a &# 039;neutral&# 039; metal oxide.

The coupled substitution Ag+ + (Bi, Sb) 3 + ↔ 2 Pb 2 +, is confirmed by data obtained, although when Bi and/or Sb are present at high concentrations (~> 0. 002 mol. %), site vacancies most likely come into play through the additional substitution 2 (Bi, Sb) 3 + + □ ↔ 3 Pb 2 +. Galena is the primary host of Tl in all mapped mineral assemblages. Thallium is likely incorporated into galena along with Cu through the coupled substitution: (Ag, Cu, Tl) + + (Bi, Sb) 3 + ↔ 2 Pb 2 +. Tin can reach significant concentrations in galena, particularly when the latter formed via metamorphic recrystallisation. <b>Tin</b> is <b>concentrated</b> in galena, likely via the substitution: Sn 4 + + □ ↔ 2 Pb 2 +, involving the creation of lattice vacancies, or Sn 2 + ↔ Pb 2 +. Tin and In concentrations show a strong positive correlation across the sample suite indicating that the availability of these elements is intimately linked in natural systems. Cadmium and minor Hg can be incorporated into galena; the simple isovalent substitution (Cd, Hg) 2 + ↔ Pb 2 + is inferred. Significant oscillatory compositional zoning, and lesser sector zoning of minor/trace elements (Ag, Sb, Bi, Se, Te) is confirmed, for the first time, in galena from two epithermal ores. Zoning is attributed to slow crystal growth into open spaces within the vein at relatively low temperatures. The datasets generated increase understanding of the nature and distribution of minor/trace elements in galena, and partitioning between galena and coexisting minerals. These data have several applications in the minerals industry, particularly in studies of mineral deposit genesis, ore processing and, potentially, also in mineral exploration. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|Fluid {{evolution}} at the Peruvian San Rafael deposit, {{which represents}} the world's largest hydrothermal tin lode was marked by two contrasting episodes. The early stage, characterized by intense sericitic and tourmaline alteration was barren and produced numerous tourmaline-quartz veins, which are sealed and reflect largely lithostatic conditions of formation. A subsequent reopening of the vein-breccia system initiated the ore stage, which was characterized by a distinctive chloritic alteration and an open fracture-filling vein style. The {{first part of the}} ore stage was dominated by tin deposition and resulted in the formation of abundant cassiterite-quartz-chlorite-bearing veins and breccias, at depth in the lode. This was followed by copper deposition (with subordinate <b>tin),</b> which <b>concentrated</b> sulfide ores in {{the upper part of the}} vein system. The waning stages of hydrothermal activity superimposed late, barren quartz veins on earlier mineralization. The delta 34 S values of sulfide minerals from San Rafael range between + 2 and + 6 ‰, suggesting a large-scale hydrothermal system, supplied by a relatively homogenous, presumably magmatic source of sulfur. Stability relationships of the ore minerals indicate that the ore fluids were reducing, which is consistent with their capacity to transport significant quantities of tin. Microthermometric studies of fluid inclusions in cassiterite, quartz, tourmaline and fluorite showed that the fluids responsible for the early, barren stage were hot, hypersaline magmatic brines (> 340 - 535 °C, 34 - 62 wt. % NaCl eq.), whereas the ore stage fluids had a moderate temperature and salinity (> 230 - 360 °C, 0 - 21 wt. % NaCl eq.). The local association of minor hematite with cassiterite, and the ubiquitous replacement of pyrrhotite by pyrite, marcasite and hematite, indicate that the ore fluids became progressively more oxidizing. In addition, the stable isotope compositions of tourmaline, cassiterite, wolframite, quartz, chlorite, calcite, and siderite reveal that the early fluid had a magmatic signature, but its delta 18 O value markedly decreased with time. These trends are consistent with mixing of the ore fluids with a cooler, dilute fluid, enriched in the light oxygen isotope, and cannot be explained by boiling or simple cooling. Fluid-rock interaction was not a control on tin deposition either, as chloritic alteration of granitic rocks increases the fluid acidity, and this in turn increases tin solubility. I infer that the creation of several large fault jogs at depth in the lode, synchronous with hydrothermal activity at the San Rafael igneous center, focused an influx of heated meteoric waters, which mixed with tin- and iron-rich magmatic brines. The oxidation, dilution, cooling and acid neutralization of the ore fluids destabilized chloride complexes of tin and iron, and triggered the massive precipitation of cassiterite with chlorite, in localized, high-grade ore shoots, as opposed to a dissemination of tin in the chloritic alteration. The formation of the San Rafael deposit took place in Late Oligocene, at the onset of a major metallogenic episode in the Inner Arc of the Central Andes. We propose that Tertiary tin-tungsten(-silver) mineralization in this province (and possibly some of the earlier metallogenic episodes) was produced by a recurrent compressional interaction between the Farallon/Nazca oceanic plate and the South American continent. Periodic "collisions" between the tectonic plates were focused on this segment of the Andean orogen and generated in its back arc voluminous peraluminous magmas, which evolved by fractional crystallization and exsolved the fluids responsible for the rich Sn-W(-Ag) mineralization...|$|R
