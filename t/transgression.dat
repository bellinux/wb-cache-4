5|$|The {{number five}} {{is also found}} in the {{structure}} of the poem itself. Sir Gawain is 101stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with <b>transgression</b> in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of <b>transgression</b> and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.|$|E

30|$|In {{line with}} {{previous}} findings, the largest proportion of <b>transgressions</b> occurred before the gates are closed and even active. Such <b>transgressions</b> were particularly associated with crossing {{in front of}} an approaching train (unlikely to be visible), and with <b>transgressions</b> in morning peak hours. In fact, contrary to what has been demonstrated by Edquist, Hughes [7] and Metaxatos and Sriraj [1], the largest proportion of <b>transgressions</b> at all three LCs occurred at morning peak hours and this was even after accounting for the number of pedestrians crossing compliantly during all closures. The observed <b>transgressions</b> in morning peak hours were associated with female pedestrians and school children. Unlike previous findings, school children were linked with crossing alone. The summary of all these simple effects could explain <b>transgressions</b> motivated by a fear of missing the next train and of being late for school. <b>Transgressions</b> before the gates have started moving and {{in front of an}} approaching train were consistently associated with crossing towards a middle island. This was globally the predominantly adopted trajectory during all <b>transgressions</b> potentially related to the motivation of catching the next train as was visible in 70  % of the cases, noting that the journey purpose was not identifiable for all <b>transgressions.</b>|$|R

40|$|The moral {{prohibition}} against harming others {{is fundamental to}} any social unit, including families with young children. Yet, infants appear less averse to harming others than do older children and adults. Infants' harmful actions may in turn elicit strong reactions from others that could contribute to the acquisition of morality. The present study investigated two main propositions: 1) mothers respond differently to infants' harmful acts against others (moral <b>transgressions)</b> than when intervening on <b>transgressions</b> related to infants' own well-being (prudential <b>transgressions)</b> or the creation of inconvenience, such as spilling (pragmatic <b>transgressions).</b> 2) Most infants harm others even without provocation. Twenty-six infants and their families participated in a 2. 5 -hour naturalistic home observation when the infant was 14 months old. Most of the families participated in additional visits when the infant was 19 (N = 24) and 24 (N = 22) months of age. All infants who participated in three visits {{had at least one}} instance of purposefully harming others and 82 percent did so without any provocation or sign of distress. The hourly frequency of unprovoked purposeful harm showed a curvilinear relation to age (Visit 1 : 0. 85, Visit 2 : 1. 42, Visit 3 : 1. 27). Compared to their interventions on prudential and pragmatic <b>transgressions,</b> mothers' interventions on moral <b>transgressions</b> involved increased use of physical interventions and direct commands, decreased use of softening interventions or distractions, and decreased relenting or compromising. Mothers also rated it as more important to discourage their children from moral <b>transgressions</b> than to discourage their children from prudential <b>transgressions.</b> These findings suggest that caregiver responses to <b>transgressions</b> provide unique opportunities for the early acquisition of the moral {{prohibition against}} harming others...|$|R

Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a <b>transgression</b> of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{other studies}} {{restrict}} {{the concept of}} psychopathy to their incapacity to distinguish between moral and legal transgressions; they know that something is illegal but not that it is morally incorrect (Fine & Kennett, 2004; Levy, 2007; Malatesti, 2010). The argument behind this authors’ group is seen in an experiment carried out by Blair (1995) with ten imprisoned psychopaths and ten controls. The subjects evaluated four stories that contained moral <b>transgressions</b> and four others containing social <b>transgressions.</b> The moral <b>transgressions</b> were bad in themselves, independent of any legal or social sanctions, whereas the rest were dependent on authoritative sanctions. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that the psychopaths {{would not be able to}} distinguish between moral and social <b>transgressions,</b> and would consider them all as if they were social ones. Nonetheless, the results were different from those hypothesized. In fact, the psychopaths considered all of the <b>transgressions</b> as moral ones. Subsequently, the experiment was replicated with a larger sample and they discovered that the psychopaths failed to make the distinction between moral and conventional social <b>transgressions</b> (Blair et al., 1995). Additionally, as compared to controls, psychopaths tend to explain their responses to moral <b>transgressions</b> in terms of harm to the wellbeing of others to a lesser degree. However, it is difficult to explain why psychopaths would consider all <b>transgressions</b> as moral ones, unless they were trying to mislead the interviewer in an attempt to earn penal privileges, or perhaps had exceptionally developed morality - something that is initially counterintuitive and contrary to construct. As an attempt to resolve this possible bias, Blair asked the psychopaths to respond in a way that they thought other individuals would when asked to classify these <b>transgressions.</b> The result was that the psychopaths correctly attributed the distinctions between moral and social <b>transgressions.</b> At least a “cognitive” ToM like that previously mentioned remains sufficiently intact due to the psychopaths’ ability to attribute these differences to others (Aharoni et al., 2012, 2014).|$|R

Across conditions, children attributed greater happiness to transgressors than to victims; “happy victimizer” responses decreased with age for prototypical but not for provoked <b>transgressions.</b> Moreover, retaliators were seen as both happier and angrier than their victims.

5|$|During {{the many}} {{changes in the}} {{operational}} plans for Fall Gelb the idea of leaving the Fortress Holland alone, just as the Dutch hoped for, was at times considered.

In the Holland-Weisung (Holland Directive) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south, but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line, and to occupy the Frisian Isles. Hermann Göring insisted on a full conquest as he needed the Dutch airfields against Britain; also he was afraid the Entente might reinforce Fortress Holland after a partial defeat and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops. Another rationale for complete conquest was that as the fall of France itself could hardly be taken for granted, it was for political reasons seen as desirable to obtain a Dutch capitulation, because a defeat might well bring less hostile governments to power in Britain and France. A swift defeat would also free troops for other front sectors.|$|E
