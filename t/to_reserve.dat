5|$|After {{returning}} to the UK in early 1946, Indefatigable was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians {{for the rest of}} the year before she was reduced <b>to</b> <b>reserve.</b> She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The Board of Admiralty decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. Indefatigable was sold for scrap the following year.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Here {{we review}} the population, community, and {{evolutionary}} consequences of marine reserves. Responses {{at each level}} depend on the tendency of fisheries to target larger body sizes and the tendency for greater reserve protection with less movement within and across populations. The primary population response <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> is survival <b>to</b> greater ages and sizes plus increases in the population size for harvested species, with greater response <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> that are large relative to species' movement rates. The primary community response <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> {{is an increase in}} total biomass and diversity, with the potential for trophic cascades and altered spatial patterning of metacommunities. The primary evolutionary response <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> is increased genetic diversity, with the theoretical potential for protection against fisheries-induced evolution and selection for reduced movement. The potential for the combined outcome of these responses to buffer marine populations and communities against temporal environmental heterogeneity has preliminary theoretical and empirical support...|$|R
5|$|Afterward she was {{assigned}} to the Evolutionary Squadron until 1875 when she was placed in reserve. Océan was recommissioned in 1879 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. She had a lengthy refit in 1884–85 and {{was assigned}} to the Northern Squadron after it was completed. Around 1888 the ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Squadron until she was reduced <b>to</b> <b>reserve</b> around 1891. Océan {{was assigned to}} the Gunnery School that same year and later became a training ship for naval apprentices before being condemned in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Cordelia {{remained}} with the 4th LCS {{through at least}} 1 February 1919. Later that month, she was reduced <b>to</b> <b>reserve</b> at Devonport.

5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the payments made <b>to</b> <b>reserve</b> players were withdrawn altogether, although there was a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of the players were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E
