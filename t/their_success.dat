5|$|After <b>their</b> <b>success</b> in {{the first}} month of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded.

5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up <b>their</b> <b>success,</b> and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E

5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. <b>Their</b> <b>success</b> in so many environments {{has been attributed to}} their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for <b>their</b> <b>success</b> was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria.

This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more.

5|$|Expanding on {{the dense}} {{production}} style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound.

The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and <b>their</b> <b>success</b> as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
