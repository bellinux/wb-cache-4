40|$|This {{background}} note revises material previously {{released by}} the Parliamentary Library on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in Afghanistan. In November 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Government of Afghanistan agreed to a formal transition process that would transfer full security responsibility to Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) {{by the end of}} 2014. This process commenced in early 2011. At the NATO Summit in Chicago in May 2012, NATO member states, the Government of Afghanistan and states contributing to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) confirmed their commitment to transitioning full security responsibility to ANSF by the end of 2014. At this time, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan is expected to transition from a combat role to a new mission with a training focus, which is expected to be supported by the United Nations Security Council. The delegation also agreed to gradually reducing the number of ANSF personnel (military and police) from a peak of 352 000 in October 2012 to 228 500 by 2014. At the NATO Summit in Chicago, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Australia’s main role of training and mentoring the ANSF in Uruzgan province would be completed by mid to late 2013. During the Chicago Summit, Australia signed a long-term partnership agreement with the Government of Afghanistan that deals with combating terrorism, narcotics and people smuggling; post- 2014 security support; development support and increased aid; business and investment; migration cooperation; and fostering cultural links. In July 2012, formal transition to Afghan-led security responsibility commenced in Uruzgan province with the Prime Minister confirming that Australia’s role should be complete by mid to late 2013. Uruzgan was included in the <b>third</b> <b>tranche</b> of provinces to commence transition to Afghan control (The first tranche occurred on 22 March 2011 and the second on 27 November 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|The Party of Regions {{took power}} in early 2010, after Ukraine had been plunged deep in {{economic}} crisis. Over the next year, with the external markets recovering, the country’s economic situation started to improve gradually. Ukraine’s economic stabilisation was also strengthened by its resumed {{cooperation with the}} International Monetary Fund, which provided for a loan worth $ 15. 1 billion. The issuing of successive tranches of the loan was made dependent on {{the implementation of a}} comprehensive reform programme. The cooperation went quite smoothly at first; however, as the economic situation in Ukraine improved, the reformist zeal of the Ukrainian government started to fade, and obstacles began piling up. As a result, Ukraine was refused the <b>third</b> <b>tranche,</b> scheduled for this March, and for the moment the credit line remains frozen. Even though the IMF has numerous reservations about the Ukrainian government’s economic policy, the fundamental condition for resuming cooperation is reform of the pension system, which the parliament should adopt. The difficulties with fulfilling the obligations made to the IMF reflect the wider problem with implementing reforms in Ukraine, as the Party of Regions promised after taking power. Changes which do not affect the interests of influential lobbies are quite easy to carry out. Often, however, these changes are not conducive to the economy’s liberalisation; moreover, the influential lobbies are successful in blocking reforms that could harm their businesses. Another impediment to the changes is that some reforms are likely to bring about painful social consequences, and that can affect public support for the ruling group. Even though theoretically possible, it does not seem likely that Ukraine’s cooperation with the IMF will be terminated. But even if this cooperation is continued, deeper reforms in Ukraine are likely to be postponed until after the parliamentary elections in autumn 2012...|$|E
40|$|Explanatory Statement Issued by the Authority of the Minister for Communications.   Legislative Authority Subsection 125 AA(4) of the Telecommunications Act 1997 {{enables the}} Minister for Communications {{to direct the}} Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), in writing, to {{determine}} a standard that applies to participants in a specified section of the telecommunications industry that deals {{with one or more}} specified matters relating to the telecommunications activities of those participants. Purpose The purpose of the Telecommunications (Amendment of International Mobile Roaming Industry Standard) Direction 2016 (Direction) is to direct the ACMA to amend the Telecommunications (International Mobile Roaming) Industry Standard 2013 (Standard). The amendments of the Standard required by the Direction are intended to allow for greater streamlining and simplification of the Standard, including: 	allowing the upfront warning and charging SMS messages to be combined into one SMS message 	increasing flexibility in the types of mechanisms {{that can be used to}} decline international mobile roaming (IMR) services 	adding the ability for suppliers of IMR services to voluntarily offer a mechanism for customers to opt out of spend management notifications 	delaying the application of parts of the Standard to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) until 2019, after the completion of the review of the Standard These changes are expected to deliver net benefits to consumers and suppliers of IMR services by: 	reducing carriage service provider messaging costs, while also reducing unnecessary message load on customers 	providing greater flexibility for both carriage service providers and their customers to terminate unwanted IMR services and opt out of spend management notifications without imposing additional consumer costs 	avoiding potentially unnecessary costs on MVNOs and a loss of market competition and consumer options. Background In August 2012, a ministerial direction was made under section 125 AA of the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (International Mobile Roaming Industry Standard) Direction (No. 1) 2012 (2012 Direction), requiring the ACMA to make the Standard. The ACMA made the Standard in June 2013 in accordance with the 2012 Direction. It commenced progressively from September 2013 in three tranches, with the second tranche having commenced on 27 September 2014 and the <b>third</b> <b>tranche</b> currently required to commence on 23 May 2016. The first tranche requires mobile carriers to send SMS messages to customers upon arrival in their destination country containing information on the pricing of IMR services in that country. This tranche requires MVNOs to either send post-paid and automatically recharging prepaid customers the same SMS messages regarding pricing, or instead to provide information to a customer prior to agreeing to provide an IMR service to the customer. This tranche also requires all carriage service providers to allow customers to opt out of purchasing these services. The second tranche requires carriers to provide spend management tools, including at least one tool to allow customers to obtain current usage estimates for IMR services. Carriers must send SMS notifications to customers in the following circumstances: 	if the customer is using a post-paid service or automatically recharging prepaid service, for every $ 100 of IMR data used 	where the customer has an included value pack for data, calls or SMS, alerts for when 50 %, 85 % and 100 % of the included value has been used 	where the customer reaches 100 % of an include value pack, a notification of the maximum charges of continuing to use the service (i. e. excess charges). The <b>third</b> <b>tranche</b> would extend the application of the pricing SMS message requirements from the first tranche and spend management tools from the second tranche to MVNOs. Industry stakeholders put forward proposals in 2014 - 15 to amend the Standard to address concerns about potential unintended consequences on MVNOs and to streamline the operation of the Standard where possible...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{developing}} a surface engineering solution for applications requiring resistance to both abrasive and adhesive wear. The central plank of this work was to deposit and characterise duplex coatings by applying thin, hard films of titanium carbo-nitrides on a pre-clad metal matrix composite (MMC) coating of tungsten carbide in nickel matrix formed by a laser cladding process. In the first tranche of the project pulsed laser cladding of WC/Ni MMC with a Nd:YAG laser and optical fibres was investigated {{with the aim of}} producing a clad layer with minimum porosity, crack and dilution but with a sound metallurgical bond to the tool steel and stainless steel substrates. Thorough microstructural (XRD, optical and electron microscopy), mechanical (hardness) and abrasive wear characterization of the clad layers enabled optimisation of laser beam parameters, type and composition of powders and substrate preparation. It was established that WC/Ni MMC prepared from injected crushed powder can substantially improve the abrasive wear resistance of the substrate, almost by a factor of 10. In the second tranche of the project a ftltered arc deposition system was utilised to deposit hard coatings of titanium nitride, carbo-nitrides and carbide. Controlled variation of the partial pressure of reactive gases (nitrogen and methane) by mass flow controllers monitored by a mass spectrometer allowed deposition of adherent, macroparticle-free fllms with any desired carbon to nitrogen ratio, on austenitic stainless steel substrates. The mechanical properties (microhardness and adhesion) of the coatings were determined using an Ultra-Micro Indentation System (UMIS- 2000) and adhesion scratch tester, respectively. The adhesive wear resistance of PVD coatings was evaluated by a pin-ondisc wear tester. It was established that higher concentration of carbon increases the hardness, reduces the adhesion but increases the adhesive wear resistance. In the <b>third</b> <b>tranche</b> of the project, duplex coatings combining a PVD film deposited on a pre-clad WC/Ni layer were produced on stainless steel substrates. The duplex coatings exhibited similar hardness and adhesive wear results to those of the PVD coatings, but with a signifIcant increase in load bearing by a factor of 4 - 5, confirming the pivotal role of clad layer to support the applied load...|$|E
