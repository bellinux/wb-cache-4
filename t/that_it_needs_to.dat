5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{make a contribution to}} maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E

5|$|The Romulans had {{attempted}} to travel {{back in time and}} destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the ShiKahr realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E
25|$|This control adjusts CRT {{focus to}} obtain the sharpest, most-detailed trace. In practice, focus needs to be {{adjusted}} slightly when observing quite-different signals, which means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be an external control. Flat-panel displays do not need focus adjustments and therefore do not include this control.|$|E
50|$|The regimental emblem was {{designed}} around the concept <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be instantly recognisable. It is also required to follow established martial insignia conventions, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{should look like}} a military badge.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the craft}} was {{intended}} to operate almost exclusively below the surface, <b>it</b> was decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be fitted with a Gyrocompass {{and was the first}} German midget submarine to be so equipped.|$|R

25|$|After the 2017 Nangarhar airstrike, Karzai {{called the}} current {{president}} Ashraf Ghani a traitor. In October 2017 Karzai stated that the US uses the Islamic State insurgency as a tool in Afghanistan, aimed at destabilizing the whole region, urging {{the international community to}} convince the US <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> actually fight terrorism.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{in which}} {{electricity}} can flow are called conductors. A piece of conducting material {{of a particular}} resistance meant {{for use in a}} circuit is called a resistor. Conductors are made of high-conductivity materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made {{of a wide variety of}} materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> dissipate, precision, and costs.|$|E
25|$|One main {{disadvantage}} of HA is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{be covered with}} exogenous material, such as sclera, polyethylene terephthalate, or vicryl mesh (which has the {{disadvantage of}} creating a rough implant tissue interface {{that can lead to}} technical difficulties in implantation and subsequent erosion of overlying tissue with the end stage being extrusion), as direct suturing is not possible for muscle attachment. Scleral covering carries with it the risk of transmission of infection, inﬂammation, and rejection.|$|E
50|$|The collaboratively-designed website was a {{mess and}} several people thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be rebuilt from scratch. A site {{redesign}} in 2012 was made without gathering feedback from the members, thus infuriating users. Another redesign was implemented in November 2014.|$|R

50|$|The airline {{terminated}} its {{joint venture}} with HeavyLift on February 1, 2001, with the stated reason to enable the airline to attract the investment <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> expand its fleet.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} using oxytocin is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be kept below {{a certain}} temperature which requires {{resources such as}} fridges which are not always available particularly in low-resourced settings. When oxytocin is not available, misoprostol can be used. Misoprostol {{does not need to}} be kept at a certain temperature and research into its effectiveness in reducing blood loss appears promising when compared with a placebo in a setting where it is not appropriate to use oxytocin. Misoprostol can cause unpleasant side effects such as very high body temperatures and shivering. Lower doses of misoprostol appear to be safer and cause less side effects.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{pancreatitis}} {{can cause}} organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people {{will need to}} be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock can be life-threatening as it can very quickly starve the body of the oxygen-rich blood <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> survive. To avoid going into hypovolemic shock, fluids will be pumped intravenously. Oxygen will be supplied through tubes attached to the nose and ventilation equipment may be used to assist with breathing. Feeding tubes may be used to provide nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} capital program costs in 2013 {{in order to}} replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds {{what it would cost}} to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion {{for the first time in}} several years. Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the Northeast Corridor included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the American Civil War Era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak's total annual budget). Amtrak's budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.|$|E
50|$|The Ilfracombe {{branch of}} the London & South Western Railway (LSWR), ran between Barnstaple and Ilfracombe in North Devon.

500|$|... "Dual Spires" [...] is {{presented}} as an homage to Twin Peaks, and CNN writer Katie McLaughlin noted several allusions the episode makes to the series. In {{the beginning of the}} episode, there is a chocolate bunny on Shawn's desk. In Twin Peaks, Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) delivered the famous line [...] "Diane, I'm holding in my hands a small box of chocolate bunnies." [...] Gus then asks, [...] "Since when is the sound of opening and closing shades so disruptive <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be alleviated?" [...] The character Nadine Hurley in Twin Peaks attempted to patent her silent drape runner invention. Someone from a website by the name of UnderTheNail.com sends Shawn and Gus an e-mail that says, [...] "Who killed Paula Merral?" [...] Twin Peaks famed the catchphrase [...] "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" [...] The killer also purposely placed clues in his victims' fingernail beds. The victim's name itself is an anagram of [...] "Laura Palmer".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{gave the}} episode a B. He had {{an issue with}} the episode [...] "reducing 'love' to an abstraction, {{for the sake of}} making it into a plot-driver," [...] but noted that [...] "at least 'A Short Story About Love' {{confines}} those wince-inducing reductions to a couple of short scenes, and in service of propelling this season’s 'displaced Peter' arc to a place <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] SFXs Dave Bradley was more critical of the episode, opining that the love premise failed to [...] "completely satisfy, at least not on a rational level" [...] and that the [...] "orange" [...] universe explanation felt like [...] "hand-waving, a cheeky attempt to untangle the series’ continuum without any further universe-hopping." [...] Bradley also noted that the plot surrounding the villain, a [...] "mad scientist MacGuffin," [...] seemed rushed and the script and direction [...] "jarringly unsubtle", but that the episode featured good performances with [...] "great details in every scene".|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Earp {{began to}} {{collaborate}} on a biography {{with his friend}} and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told {{in a way that}} he approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, [...] "You can't write <b>that!</b> <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be clean." [...] She also demanded that they add more [...] "pep" [...] to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word [...] "CRACK!" [...] in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled [...] "Conflagration" [...] in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Angelica Jade Bastién, {{writing for}} RogerEbert.com, said, [...] "For {{all of its}} wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the {{evolutionary}} step forward for Marvel <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times." [...] Mara Reinstein of US Weekly called the film [...] "joyless" [...] and wrote, [...] "Despite [...] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here — save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations." [...] Rex Reed of the New York Observer called Doctor Strange [...] "an awkwardly cliché-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality" [...] and said, [...] "None of it makes any sense... For characterization, dialogue, narrative arc, acceptable acting and coherence, go elsewhere." [...] Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, [...] "Cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in the lead role... But that’s the thing: He’s a better party guest than he is a host. Doctor Strange is a fine introduction, but by the end, you’re not sad to be headed for the door." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story would}} have seen the Deltan, Ilia (Persis Khambatta), {{becoming}} pregnant by an alien entity as the ship passes near a nebula. She gives birth to a baby girl, who she names Irska. The Enterprise suffers multiple near-disasters, which are each resolved by the intervention of the child. Meanwhile the ship's hull is slowly dissolving and the vessel will break apart in a matter of hours. The new Vulcan science officer Xon (David Gautreaux) mind melds with the child and discovers <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be transported directly into a bright light which had been pursuing the Enterprise. This procedure is completed and as the child enters the light, it transforms into a higher life form. The episode ends with the crew musing that Ilia acted as the being's first womb and the Enterprise was the second. The series was cancelled as it went into initial production for the pilot, [...] "In Thy Image", with that being rewritten as [...] The script for the Phase II version of [...] "The Child" [...] was later reprinted in full in Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens' 1997 book Star Trek: Phase II: The Lost Series.

When Chloe stops her investigation, Lionel has her fired from the Daily Planet, and also fires her father from his job at LuthorCorp. In season three's [...] "Forsaken", Chloe decides to assist Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), Lionel's son, with getting Lionel arrested for the murder of Lex' grandparents; Chloe's hope is to get out from under Lionel's control. In the season three finale, the F.B.I. place Chloe and her father in a safe-house until Lionel's trial; unfortunately, the safe-house explodes once Chloe and her father enter and they are presumed dead. Chloe's cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe's death in the fourth season premiere. In season four's [...] "Gone", Clark and Lois team-up and discover that Lex's security team found the explosives in the safe-house, pulled Chloe and her father to safety before they detonated, and that he has been hiding her ever since. After Chloe's testimony in the same episode, Lionel is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In the season four episode [...] "Pariah", Chloe discovers Clark's secret when Alicia Baker (Sarah Carter), Clark's girlfriend, decides <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be exposed to the world in order for him to feel more comfortable about who he really is.
