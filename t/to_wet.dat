5|$|A {{large number}} of the species grow in moist <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but the species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Some species grow in dry areas, others in wet habitats, such {{as members of the}} section Simiolus, which are hydrophilic. Both overall plant size and corolla size vary greatly throughout the genus. A minimum of 25 of the species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Dennis lightly {{affected}} Mississippi, dropping between 1–5inches (25–125mm) {{of rainfall}} and producing wind gusts up to , causing several hundred trees to uproot or snap and damaging {{a total of}} 21homes and businesses. Over 40structures were flooded, forcing 200people to leave their homes. One indirect death occurred from a traffic accident in Jasper County due <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> roads. During {{the height of the}} storm, 24,000customers were without power. In all, Hurricane Dennis caused $2.4million (2005USD) in damage across the state.|$|E
5|$|In Southaven, 40homes were flooded and 200were left {{homeless}} as {{a result}} of the heavy rainfall. A church undergoing construction in Calhoun County was damaged, and a street light in Lee County was snapped. Also, a fallen tree damaged a house in Itawamba County. One indirect fatality occurred in Jasper County from an automobile accident due <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> roads. An estimated 24,000customers lost electric power during the storm. After the storm, several fires were sparked due to downed electrical wires. In all, the weakening Hurricane Dennis left $2.6million (2005USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of developments that can take place. There are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E

5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which could count up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnant of}} Alberto {{produced}} strong winds across the Canadian Maritimes, including gusts of 74mph (119km/h) in the Barrington district of Nova Scotia. Sustained winds reached 51mph (83km/h). Rainfall {{from the storm}} was moderate, with some locations reporting 0.4inches (10mm) per hour; totals exceeded 2inches (50mm) in numerous areas. Due <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> grounds, the winds knocked down some trees and several tree limbs, and also downed some power lines, causing localized power outages. Moderate winds and rainfall affected Newfoundland, as well. According to a press report, the storm left four sailors missing about 230miles (370km) south of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, having been recorded from Europe, North, Central, and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In British Columbia, Canada, {{it is sometimes}} found on maple, poplar, or pine, but is most abundant on red alder. It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic <b>to</b> <b>wet.</b> The fungus grows parasitically on the mycelium of wood-rotting corticioid fungi in the genus Peniophora. Occasionally, T.mesenterica and its host fungus can be found fruiting together.|$|E

5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Hammond {{increased}} his first-class wicket total to 47, and scored 1,781 runs {{at an average}} of 42.40. Although he remained a key batsman for Gloucestershire, both his aggregate and average fell, at least partly due <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> weather that often led to difficult batting conditions. In the three Tests against New Zealand, their first in England, he made an attacking century in the second Test, England's only victory. He did not pass fifty {{in the rest of the}} series, ending the victorious campaign with 169 runs {{at an average of}} 56.33. In 1932, Hammond was appointed vice-captain of Gloucestershire, but it was noted in Wisden that he sometimes failed to inspire his team. Hammond himself felt unable, as a new captain, to take the same risks that Lyon had done. He scored 2,528 runs (average 56.17), including his then highest score of 264, and his first hundred for the Players against the Gentlemen. He also took 53 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E

5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
5|$|Western {{and central}} Europe were also {{impacted}} by damaging winds and downpours. The {{coast of the}} Netherlands endured high seas and gusts to 67mph (108km/h), uprooting trees and flooding the coastline. Rail services and flight operations were disrupted throughout the region. In Germany, gusts over 90mph (145km/h) were recorded at high elevations. In Stuttgart alone, 50vehicles were damaged by falling debris; downed trees, torn roofs, and power outages were common throughout the nation. In the capital of Munich, the storm destroyed a large tin roof measuring over 850sq ft (80sq m), parts of which impacted cars and fences on the ground. Damage from the incident was estimated at €500,000. Throughout Germany, the storm wrought €60–100 million in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> road conditions, along the Bundesstraße 303 in the Bayreuth district. Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline, with tides running over 7ft (2m) above normal along the Elbe River at Hamburg. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages. A tornado touched down near Neukirchen an der Enknach in Austria, damaging homes and farms. Gusts in southern Switzerland reached , leading to road and rail closures. In southern France, the system initiated a mistral wind event.|$|E

5|$|Wet {{weather in}} the {{following}} two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited <b>to</b> <b>wet</b> pitches {{and it was only}} late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E
