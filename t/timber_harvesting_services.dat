Most biological variables did not vary systematically with either <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> or downstream location. Dissolved organic carbon did not vary with <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> or downstream location, but correlated positively with salmonid abundance.

40|$|Executive Summary How This Atlas Will Contribute Telling the Story Change in Public <b>TImber</b> <b>Harvest.</b> Public <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> is {{the volume}} of <b>timber</b> <b>harvested</b> from Federal, state, county, and {{municipal}} lands. Public <b>timber</b> <b>harvests</b> decreased in all but four counties in the region.

Change in Public and Private <b>Timber</b> <b>Harvest.</b> The total change in <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> was affected by both the harvest from public lands and the harvest from privately owned lands. As Federal harvests declined, harvests from other ownerships could either moderate or exacerbate the change..

40|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> and {{transport}} are crucial {{components of the}} cost of delivered wood to forest products processing facilities. In fact, harvesting and delivering wood often costs more than the entire costs of growing wood until <b>harvest.</b> As such, <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research and development are important. Additionally, research in this area is worthwhile because efficiency gains, cost improvements, and environmental benefits due to <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research can be realized {{in a very short time}} period, rather than the decades-long wait required for research investments in timber growing. This paper provides an overview of the means of measuring the impact of new technology on <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> costs. In recent years, there have been many efforts to increase research for developing better harvesting equipment and methods. In conjunction with these efforts, greater demands have been made for research efficiency and accountability (Silversides et al. 1988); several studies have therefore been completed to measure the impacts of <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research and development.

It is also a major offerer of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to this area. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the relationship between Japanese bilateral ODA to three Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia) and tropical <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in these countries. Two different methods are applied: econometric timber market model analysis and the Granger causality test. Timber market model analysis shows a significant correlation between Japanese bilateral ODA and <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Indonesia and in Malaysia. It also shows a significant correlation between <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Malaysia and the number of new housing construction starts in Japan. There is no significant relationship for the Philippines. The Granger causality test shows clear evidence of causality from Japanese housing construction to <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Indonesia, and also to Japanese bilateral ODA to Indonesia. It shows evidence of causality from <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Malaysia to Japanese bilateral ODA to Malaysia, too. There are no causal effects among <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in the Philippines, Japanese bilateral ODA to the Philippines, and Japanese housing construction.

40|$|In British Columbia, {{a lack of}} {{understanding}} exists concerning the tradeoffs between <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> and maintaining ecosystem services, where losses of these services can occur as externalities from the <b>timber</b> <b>harvest.</b> This study provides insight into such tradeoffs by estimating the value of a change in a forest’s water purification/filtration service, focusing on the quality of water as it becomes degraded from <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> activities. I use an integrated economic-ecological model to quantify the economic impact of forest road induced sedimentation on raw water quality prior to its arrival at a municipal drinking water utility. I find that the economic value of the water purification/filtration service is more sensitive to traffic volume than aggregate road length and, therefore, should be subjected to more regulation in those watersheds that must consider the tradeoffs between the supply of clean drinking water and <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} shelterwood cutting on the {{abundance}} of Jordan's salamander (Plethodon Jordan!) in western North Carolina were examined during 1997 and 1998. Terrestrial salamander assemblages were sampled before, immediately after, and one year after <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> on control and treatment plots to estimate abundance. We also sur-veyed salamanders immediately after the harvest along transects radiating out from cut plots to determine whether cutting triggered salamander emigration from disturbed plots. Both before and after <b>timber</b> <b>harvest,</b> the site was strongly dominated by Jordan's sala-mander. No significant effects of initial shelterwood cutting on Jordan's salamander abun-dance were apparent after <b>timber</b> <b>harvest.</b> Abundance of this species decreased from pre-cutting to post-cutting sampling on both control and treatment plots, which likely reflected the drought that characterized both post-cutting sampling periods, but not pre-cutting sampling. No emigration of salamanders from the cut plots was detected after timber har-vest These findings suggest that at a stand scale, shelterwood harvests may pose less of a short-term threat to salamander populations than clearcutting, but more study is necessary to assess broad-scale tradeoffs between harvest yield and biological impacts associated with alternative <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> methods.

40|$|Multiple global {{changes such as}} <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{in areas}} not {{previously}} disturbed by cutting and climate change will undoubtedly affect the composition and spatial distribution of boreal forests, which will, in turn, affect the ability of these forests to retain carbon and maintain biodiversity. To predict future states of the boreal forest reliably, {{it is necessary to}} understand the complex interactions among forest regenerative processes (succession), natural disturbances (e. g., fire, wind, and insects), and anthropogenic disturbances (e. g., <b>timber</b> <b>harvest).</b> We used a landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) to study the relative effects of climate change, <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and insect outbreaks on forest composition, biomass (carbon), and landscape pattern in south-central Siberia. We found that most response variables were more strongly influenced by <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> and insect outbreaks than by the direct effects of climate change. Direct climate effects generally increased tree productivity and modified probability of establishment, but indirect effects on the fire regime generally counteracted the direct effects of climate on forest composition. Harvest and insects significantly changed forest composition, reduced living aboveground biomass, and increased forest fragmentation. We concluded that: (1) Global change is likely to significantly change forest composition of south-central Siberian landscapes, with some changes taking ecosystems outside the historic range of variability. (2) The direct effects of climate change in the study area are not as significant as the exploitation of virgin forest by <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> and the potential increased outbreaks of the Siberian silk moth. (3) Novel disturbance by <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> and insect outbreaks may greatly reduce the aboveground living biomass of Siberian forests and may significantly alter ecosystem dynamics and wildlife populations by increasing forest fragmentation...|$|R
