5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. <b>The</b> <b>players,</b> <b>in</b> {{the first of a}} convoy of four coaches, waved to the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E

He was {{selected}} 11th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, but was traded to Calgary prior to making his NHL debut. He led the NHL in goals and points in 2001–02, and won the Lester B.

5|$|At the {{inception}} of the Premier League in 1992–93, just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland. By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36percent of the total. In the 2004–05 season the figure had increased to 45percent. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match. By 2009, under 40% of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the Premier League were English.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E

He felt <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> the new all-red would appear more intimidating {{than in the}} {{previous}} red shirts, white shorts and white socks. Liverpool lost in the semi-final to Internazionale. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing questionable Italian goals. In the 1965 FA Cup Final Hunt put Liverpool ahead in extra time. Leeds United's Billy Bremner equalised. St John then scored for a 2–1 first ever Liverpool FA Cup triumph. Defence of their League title ended in seventh place.|$|E

5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues {{of control and}} equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden was {{churning}} out a repertoire – new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in {{the first two}} years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – {{and while he was}} not always able to retain <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a de facto training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E
