40|$|Section 254 (b) (3) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act {{established}} the objective that residents of rural areas {{should have access}} to advanced telecommunications and information services comparable to services in urban areas.

This paper focuses on the <b>telephone</b> <b>platform</b> because cable companies often do not serve rural areas due to the high cost of service, and because there is no mechanism for the federal or state government to subsidize the provision of advanced telecommunications services via cable.

40|$|Disruptive {{technologies}} are increasingly {{a feature of}} the information and communications technology field, particularly in mobile communications where the market is nearing saturation in most developed countries and where market advantage is achieved through a rapid cycle of innovation. M-commerce, which is the use of a mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>platform</b> to conduct commercial transactions, is illustrative of a disruptive technology. Disruptive technologies (Christenson 1999) emerge when innovation results in an interruption to the development of established product the latter being referred to as sustaining technologies as they improve the performance of established products. Christenson postulates that excessive customer focus can therefore prevent a firm from creating new markets and customers. Traditional market research is neither sufficiently insightful nor timely to give indications of market response to these disruptive technologies and services as there is no prior user experience on which to base product development. This paper describes work towards identifying users ’ responses to a technology with which they have had no prior experience, namely m-commerce. The research approach, involving a multi-disciplinary team using both telephone interviews and focus groups, is described. The findings from the initial market profile survey on the potential for m-commerce take up are summarised and an explanation of how this data was used in structuring the focus groups is given. The approach which was used in the focus groups to gain an understanding of user contexts and perceptions by leading the participants, to envisage transacting on a future mobile technology platform, is also described...|$|E

More specifically, little is known about hospital discharge co- ordination, although this is seen as a sensitive phase of clinical pathway. Purpose The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and quan- tify the categories of activities performed by nurse navigators for hospital discharge coordination. Methods Patients supported within the Coordinating Outpatient Care department (COC) at Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France). Study conducted over two consecutive phases (Feb-September 2014) : (1) a qualitative phase to iden- tify the categories of coordination activities (interviews with patients plus, focus groups with nurse navigators—NNs); (2) a quantitative phase to quantify the relative share of each category. The calls received through the <b>telephone</b> <b>platform</b> of COC (made by both patients and primary care providers) were systematically reported (caller; reason for the call; pro- cedure performed) and then analyzed. Results Qualitative phase: 17 interviews with patients, plus 2 focus groups with NNs. Quantitative phase: 543 calls ana- lyzed. The callers were patients or their relatives (38 %), pri- vate nurses (35 %), medical device providers (20 %), and other primary care providers (e. g., pharmacists, family physi- cians) (7 %). Five categories of coordination activitiesidentified: (F 1) Patient monitoring (29 %); (F 2) Helping to navigate (24 %); (F 3) Managing technical problems (17 %); (F 4) Explaining care protocols (16 %); (F 5) Collecting and transmitting the patient medical record information (14 %).

40|$|POLITICS BY PROVINCE: Goal-oriented {{rational}} action or value-oriented {{rational action}} in closed {{debate on the}} Wadden region and public consultation on the ecological infrastructure General This thesis is a study of political conduct, and of provincial politics in particular. It is based on three research projects. The first two research projects are empirical studies that examine, respectively, {{the functioning of the}} discussion platform for government bodies relating to the Wadden Islands area and the relationship between the regional press and provincial political organs. Each of these two projects is based on a defined problem, a theoretical framework, methodology and conclusions. Although both case studies deal with provincial politics, they are completely separate from each other. The third case study is theoretical. It seeks to clarify the rationalization theories of Max Weber and Karl Mannheim, and place the concepts of goaloriented rational action and value-oriented rational action in their theoretical context. This theoretical chapter produces a number of research questions that {{can be used as a}} ‘rationality grid’ to be applied to the two empirical case studies in order to determine what form of action, goal-rational or value-rational, characterizes provincial politics. Chapter One describes the background to the studies and gives a short introduction to the research themes. This chapter also presents a view of contemporary provincial politics and discusses the scientific position from which this thesis has been written, emphasizing the unique role of the sociological vision. How does the government manage the Wadden Sea? The first section examines the way in which the government manages the Wadden Sea. The study is based on an evaluation study of the functioning of the Coördinatiecollege Waddengebied (CCW) in the period 1987 to 1994. The CCW (a platform for administrative consultation between the government, the Wadden provinces and the Wadden municipalities) was set up in 1980 for the purpose of “ensuring coherent administration and an coordinated policy by the government, provinces and municipalities with regard to the Wadden region. ” The study is based on a bottleneck analysis; in other words, by identifying problems, concrete solutions can be proposed. The evaluation study employed a combination of two popular lines of research in organizational sociology literature – the ‘whole-system approach’ and the ‘parties approach’. In the whole-system approach, shared values or a feeling of solidarity are what unites the organization. In the parties approach, the organization is seen as a coalition of parties with different interests and aims. The parties work together for their own benefit, or because negative sanctions force them to do so. Both approaches are integrated in the ‘parties-withina-system’ perspective, which focuses on the relationships between the parties and the organization as a whole. This integral approach was used to evaluate the functioning of the CCW because the CCW places great emphasis on shared values and responsibilities, which are the core elements of the whole-system approach. At the same time, however, the CCW is composed of different parties which all have their own tasks, powers and interests – the core elements of the parties approach. This perspective has been tailored to the evaluation of the CCW using the following criteria: shared values, support base, differing interests, power structure, sense of purpose, and success/failure factors. The study is based on qualitative interviews with participants in the CCW <b>platforms,</b> <b>telephone</b> interviews with councillors and members of the States General, dossier analyses and reconstructions from minutes from the CCW consultations on the following cases: enlarging the scope of the Nature Conservation Act; delegation of powers with regard to inspection and control; co-ordination of international activities, problems relating to ‘traditional brown shipping’; the review of the Waddenzee II Key Planning Decision, and gas extraction in the Wadden Sea. This treatment of the original research report emphasizes a systematic description of conduct within the context of the administrative co-ordination of the Wadden region, which is usually of a closed nature. The main problem areas are the following:  a lack of shared values due to the fact that the purpose of the Wadden consultation platform is given a different interpretation depending on the interests in question;  by way of preparation for the Wadden consultations, a process of harmonization takes place within the various authorities, thereby creating an administrative support base. However, this process of preliminary consultation and feedback reveals the other side of the bureaucratic coin – this circuit is, administratively and politically speaking, strongly inward-looking;  there are no substantial conflicts of interest between the layers of government. However, mutual suspicion exists with regard to the extent to which other parties are committed to the Wadden policy. Each party suspects that the other parties will ultimately allow economic interests to prevail;  with regard to the delegation of authority, the balance of power between the government and the provinces is seen as unacceptable. The continuous lack of consensus, whether manifest or otherwise, is a barrier to discussion on a equal footing;  there are various problems relating to the sense of purpose, including the role of the Chairman and the lack of a clear definition/delegation of tasks. This analysis shows that the problems are not related to the structure of the Wadden consultative platform but rather to its culture, and more specifically to the participants’ perceptions of the role and responsibilities of the platform. In addition, there appears to be a distinct lack of leadership. The main conclusions are as follows:  harmonization within the various Wadden authorities (government, provinces and municipalities) hampers harmonization between the Wadden authorities;  the representatives from the three layers of government do not present the role and purpose of the consultative platform in a consistent and uniform way;  the CCW is hampered in its work by an ongoing debate about how powers are delegated between the layers of government. Because the analysis of success and failure factors revealed that clearly defined relationships between the government authorities are essential for successful consultation, possible solutions aim to create that clarity. Recommendations have been laid down, for example, relating to the role of the Chairman, drawing up the agenda, and clearly defining the tasks of the various bodies. Although, as far back as 1995, the CCW largely acknowledged the problem areas and supported the proposals for improvement, none of the recommendations will actually be implemented before 2001. Politics and the press on the ecological infrastructure in Friesland and Drenthe Section 2 describes a study of the relationship between the regional press and northern provincial politics. The basis for the study is the political decision-making regarding the establishment of the ecological infrastructure in the provinces of Friesland and Drenthe in the period 1989 to 1996. The conclusion of a survey of the relationship between the printed press and parliamentary democracy is that the main function of the press is to provide information, criticism and comment. The role of information-provider is examined on the basis of the following:  actual report of a meeting of the Provincial Councils;  a news report giving information about matters relating to the ecological infrastructure in both provinces;  a background article describing the context, history and/or different interpretations of matters relating to the ecological infrastructure. The role of critic is examined on the basis of the following:  editorial comment;  a column in which one of the editors gives his opinion under his own name;  opinions of third parties, in which a third party, who is not an editor, is given the opportunity to express an opinion. Using four recent examples, it is then argued that the central question relating to the relationship between politics and the press is one of management – who controls political communication or, put another way, is the relationship determined by ‘party logic’ or by ‘media logic’? The study will compare decision-making on the ecological infrastructure (as this was perceived in decision-making meetings of the provincial councils) with reporting by the regional press in both provinces. The decision-making process of the provincial councils was reconstructed for this purpose. The result is not only an analytical reconstruction of the decision-making surrounding the ecological infrastructure in Friesland and Drenthe, but also a chronicle of provincial political customs and morals. A quantitative and qualitative analysis subsequently shows how the regional press fulfils its role as information provider and critic. The quantitative analysis addresses the question of how often the press fulfils its role as information provider and critic with regard to decision-making on the ecological infrastructure. The qualitative analysis addresses the question of how the press fulfils those roles. It is argued that the quality of the information provided is determined by the degree of objectivity, but that the best measure of quality is a clear standpoint. These conclusions were used to formulate an ‘ideal’ against which the quality of informative and critical articles can be measured. A factual report is as objective as possible when:  it deals not only with the decision itself, but also with the opinion-forming process;  it gives the opinion not only of the representatives of official bodies, but also of opponents or those outside such bodies;  the reporter does not give his own opinion.
