40|$|A {{model of}} {{industry}} speed of price adjustment {{is derived from}} firm pricing behaviours. The model is applied to quarterly two-digit Australian manufacturing data for the period 1985 : 3 to 2002 : 3. Initially, the industry speed of price adjustment is treated {{as a function of}} structural cross-section variables. The results suggest that the industry speed of price adjustment is positively related to the average size of large firms within the industry and is negatively related to industry concentration. With the inclusion of time variables into the final estimating equation, we find that import share has a role in attenuating the effects of industry concentration and that the trend real GDP growth reduces the speed of price adjustment. While a 1990 <b>s</b> <b>dummy</b> variable is included in the final estimating equation and is found to be significant, its magnitude is too small to be of economic importance. Calculated industry speeds of price adjustment are stable across the period of examination but are also small, suggesting that manufacturing prices are sticky...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates a state 2 ̆ 7 s {{economic environment}} subsequent {{to a state}} tax modification for evidence of change in business presence. ^ Sponsors of economically motivated state tax policy initiatives generally adopt a tax reduction program {{in order to improve}} a state 2 ̆ 7 s business climate and to stimulate a state 2 ̆ 7 s economy. The results of previous empirical studies researching the possible linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is inconclusive. ^ This dissertation examines the economic period subsequent to New York State 2 ̆ 7 s 1987 tax policy change in order to detect shifts in business presence within New York. Detecting shifts in business presence after a state tax reduction provides evidence of a nexus between tax initiatives and economic stimulation. ^ Time series models were developed to incorporate the economic environment prior to the 1987 tax modification in New York. The specific monthly time series data examined were: employment in non-agriculture, the unemployment rate, and the business activity index. Quarterly income tax collection were also examined as a measure of economic prosperity. ^ Three different research methods were employed to examine the four time series. The three methods were, CuSum chart of quality control, sequential application of the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> t-test, and <b>dummy</b> variable multiple regression. ^ The results of the analysis provide some basis for concluding that a linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is not as robust as legislators perceive. None of the time series examined exhibited long term improvement. ^ Another implication of this dissertation is that the methods of quality control generate earlier signals as to the ineffectiveness of New York State 2 ̆ 7 s tax modification than either the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> t-test or <b>dummy</b> variable multiple regression. ...|$|R

40|$|Mouse xenotropic and {{polytropic}} leukemia viruses (XMVs and PMVs) {{are closely}} related gammaretroviruses that use the XPR 1 receptor for entry. To identify amino acid residues in XPR 1 important for virus entry, we tested mouse cells derived from evolutionarily divergent species for susceptibility to prototypical PMVs, XMVs, and the wild mouse isolate CasE# 1. CasE# 1 has a variant XMV/PMV host range, and sequence analysis of the CasE# 1 env gene identifies segments related to PMVs and XMVs. Cells from the Asian mouse species Mus pahari show a unique pattern of susceptibility to these three viruses; these cells are susceptible to XMVs and CasE# 1 but are resistant to PMVs, whereas NIH 3 T 3 cells show the reciprocal pattern, susceptibility to only PMVs. The M. pahari XPR 1 gene {{differs from that of}} NIH 3 T 3 in the two extracellular loops (ECLs) previously shown to mediate virus entry (M. Marin, C. <b>S.</b> <b>Tailor,</b> A. Nouri, <b>S.</b> L.

Using transfected hamster cells expressing chimeric and mutated XPR 1 s, we demonstrated that the susceptibility differences between NIH 3 T 3 and M. pahari cells are receptor mediated, that PMV entry requires residues in ECL 3, that the CasE# 1 entry determinant is in ECL 4, and that determinants for XMV entry are in both ECL 3 and ECL 4. Additional substitutions in ECL 3 and ECL 4 modulate virus susceptibility and suggest that ECL 3 and ECL 4 may contribute to the formation of a single virus receptor site. The position of M. pahari {{at the base of the}} Mus phylogenetic tree indicates that XPR 1 -mediated susceptibility to XMVs is the ancestral type in this genus and that the phenotypic variants of mouse XPR 1 likely arose in conjunction with exposure to gammaretrovirus infections and coevolutionary adaptations in the viral envelope...|$|R

In this descriptive correlational study, self-care was measured using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), which measures self-care maintenance (SC-Mt), self-care management (SC-Mn), and self-care self-confidence (SC-Sc).

40|$|The {{world is}} {{experiencing}} a rapid rise in chronic health problems, which places an enormous burden on health care services. Modifiable health behaviors such as physical inactivity are largely responsible for this high prevalence and incidence of chronic diseases. Message tailoring is a well-established approach for constructing health communication and {{has been shown to}} increase the persuasiveness of messages in the promotion of healthy behaviors. Message framing is an effective strategy that has been well-studied in psychology over the past 20 -plus years across a breadth of health-related behaviors but has received little attention in the nursing research literature. Based on prospect theory, temporal construal theory, and motivational orientation theories, the present study examined how two individual differences factors - consideration of future consequences (CFC) and motivational orientation - combine to moderate temporal proximity and valence framing effects on intentions to increase physical activity. A mail survey was conducted using Dillman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tailored</b> Design Method. Two hundred and eighteen adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive one of four versions of a health message aimed to increase regular physical activity. Messages were framed using a 2 (immediate- vs. distal-framed) x 2 (gain- vs. loss-framed) design. After reading the message, participants rated their intention to increase physical activity. They also completed a measure of CFC and two measures of motivational orientation. Participants who read a message with a temporal proximity or valence frame congruent with their CFC or motivational orientation, respectively, did not show greater intentions to increase physical activity when compared to those who read a health message that was incongruent with these individual differences. Plausible explanations for these negative results are considered. Several interesting findings emerged from supplemental analyses. For instance, participants who perceived the health message as more believable tended to have greater intentions to increase physical activity. Suggestions for future research applying message congruence to promote complex health behaviors in at-risk populations are given. Implications of message framing and other message tailoring strategies for nursing research, education, and practice are discussed...|$|R

Through its evocative visualizing of the invisible properties of ultraviolet light, Vitaglass captured the imagination if not the market, and opened the door not only for competitors, but for today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailoring</b> of architectural glass to particular performance characteristics. In asking the question, 2 ̆ 2 what were the latent bodies in ultraviolet health glass? 2 ̆ 2 this dissertation relates the story of Vitaglass and its claims and interests, and how these were both communicated, and embodied in the built environment. These bodies are not physically present, but latent within the material, its communication, and the buildings in which it is found. In unpacking these bodies, this dissertation first considers them as enmeshed within a context of the sciences of light and medicine, the technologies of glass and the practices of health. The bodies are revealed through an examination of business records, reports and memos, advertising imagery and print, and client testimonials alongside built and imagined architectural projects in the United States and Britain. Needy bodies were constructed of and conveyed through the rational and persuasive words and images of a propaganda campaign. But, these could also be found within the concerns of and positions taken by a number of interwar agencies, and in the words, buildings and projects of interwar architects, who saw their work as remedial for both social and physical ills, and in that sense not unlike an array of consumer goods, which each offered the dream of a body without needs. Magical bodies were resident both in the imagery and word-magic of its body of advertising, and in the glass substance itself, which became capable of the invisible transduction of sunlight into a disease-free, healthy, and better life. Underpinning both the transductive power of the glass and the psychological control posed by the words and symbols used in its advertising, were the normal bodies propounded by the emerging techniques and fields of graphical measurement, statistics, and scientific management. This interdisciplinary study offers a way of reconsidering the ways in which buildings are shaped by the design of their materials and the concerns and capacities embodied in those designs. It furthermore offers a way of understanding the ways in which those designs, through the built environment, can impact both building performance and human practice. ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis discusses {{the creation of a}} novel platform that incorporates multiple communication methods, including SMS, email and web-based technologies, for interacting with users of mobile communication devices. The platform utilises people in a mobile environment to solve a range of different application problems, where each problem is a separate and distinct scenario type with unique objectives. There are existing applications available that interact with users of mobile communication devices to provide a service, such as regular weather updates to the users. Other applications have been designed to manage and coordinate the users to perform tasks within a mobile environment, such as performing field studies for scientific purposes. However, the existing applications are designed for only one specific scenario, with the design and implementation solely focused on solving the objectives of that scenario. Each component of these applications needs to be developed from scratch in order to cater for the application s requirements. There is currently no integrated communications platform that offers a framework for supporting a range of different scenario types. The new platform, entitled the Connected-Mobile Platform, aims to support the rapid development and implementation of new scenarios. This platform is composed of a framework of generic components that enable the active running of multiple scenarios concurrently, with the ability to tailor to the requirements of new scenarios as they arise via a structured process. The platform facilitates a means to coordinate its users in order to tackle the objectives of a scenario. The thesis investigates several system architectures to determine an appropriate architectural design for constructing the proposed platform. The platform has a generic framework, based on a client-server architecture, to facilitate the inclusion of a multitude of scenarios. A scenario represents a problem or an event, whereby the platform can utilise and interact with users of mobile communication devices to attempt to solve the objectives of the scenario. Three mobile communication methods are supported; the Short Message Service, electronic mail and web-forms via the mobile internet. Users are able to select and switch between the different methods. The thesis describes the platform <b>s</b> <b>tailored</b> communication structure for scenarios and autonomous analysis of messages. The thesis discusses case studies of two different scenarios to evaluate the platform s facilities for rapid scenario development. The Diet Diary scenario, which is for individual users, aims to manage a user s daily calorie intake to help them reach their desired weight goal. The focus is on the platform s functionality for analysing and responding to messages autonomously. The Missing Persons scenario, which utilises multiple users, involves tracking and locating people who have been reported missing. The focus is on the platform s functionality for coordinating the multiple users, through the creation of assignments, in order to distribute the scenario objectives. The thesis concludes by highlighting the novel features of the platform and identifying opportunities for future work...|$|R

The first and the second papers investigate two issues arising from global sourcing of multinational corporations. The third paper empirically studies whether U. S innovation is influenced by intellectual property rights protection in other countries. Chapter one is 'Cluster-based Economic Growth and Sourcing Behavior of Multinationals'. The paper considers the relationship between global sourcing of multinational enterprises and agglomeration effect of industrial clusters by extending an intra-industry heterogeneity North-South trade model (embedded with property-rights approach). We assume {{that there is only}} one cluster in each industry in the South and in the North. The actual scale of a cluster (measured by the number of firms which produce manufacturing goods in the cluster) is determined by the investment or outsourcing choice of multinationals or final goods producers. We investigate respectively the industries of high headquarter intensity and the industries of low headquarter intensity. In either case, multiple equilibria exist. When the headquarter intensity is very low, the multinationals do not produce intermediate goods internally. Normally firms with relatively low productivities find their suppliers in the North whereas firms with relatively high productivities outsource in the South. When the headquarter intensity is high enough, at most three organizational forms exist in equilibrium and no firms outsource in the South. Also, firms with low productivities will procure intermediate goods in the North, while firms which have high productivities will source the inputs from the South. In either case, we derive that in industries with higher wage rates, more varieties of goods are produced in the South, but not in the North. The reason is that the agglomeration effect of industrial clusters cancels out the effect of higher wage rates on production cost. Therefore, the development mode of cluster-based economic growth in the South is interpreted under our framework. Moreover, in the industries of low headquarter intensity, hollowing-out trend might take place; but in the industries of high headquarter intensity, more varieties of intermediate goods will still be produced in the North rather than in the South. Since the industrial scale of headquarter intensive sector in the South is not as large as that in the North, the paper suggests that high-tech industries of the South should be nurtured under self-reliance policy. Chapter two is 'Global Sourcing: Complete Contract and Imperfect Law Enforcement'. It assumes that the contract between a multinational corporation and its outside intermediate supplier is complete, while law enforcement is imperfect when the multinational breach the contract. We investigate the sorting pattern of the organizational forms of multinationals with different productivity. The pattern is described respectively when the law enforcement probability in the South is rather low or much stronger. When the probability of law enforcement in the South is low, at most three organizational forms exist in equilibrium. Firms with lower productivity integrate vertically in the North or in the South, but firms having the highest productivity will outsource their input suppliers in the South. When the probability of law enforcement in the South is high, there are four types of organizational choice of the final-goods producers. Normally, firms with the lowest productivity make internally the intermediate goods in the North whereas firms with highest productivity outsource the intermediate inputs in the South. Then we study the relative prevalence of different organizational modes. The fraction of firms choosing any particular organizational forms depends on the wage differential across countries, the degree of productivity dispersion in an industry, the probability of law enforcement in the South, the social penalty of breach of contracts, the headquarter intensity of the multinational corporation, the difference of fixed management costs and other factors. Specifically, weaker law enforcement in the South will attract more multinationals to source suppliers overseas and smaller social penalty has a similar effect on the choice of multinationals. Chapter three is 'Does IPR protection in Developing Countries Influence Technological Innovation in the U. S?' It uses patent data to empirically test the relationship between IPR protection in other countries and technological innovation in the U. S. The U. S government always urges developing countries to adopt a more stringent policy towards IPR protection. It often claims that weak protection in these countries would reduce the return of innovation of U. S companies and hamper their incentive towards innovation activity. This paper does a series of regressions and verifies that the U. S argument does not stand up. We use the data of patent application in 1967 - 1999 filed in the USPTO (categorized by six technological sectors) to stand for innovation in U. <b>S</b> companies. <b>Dummies</b> are utilized to reflect the policy shift in IPR protection in other countries during this period. Control variables such as per capita GDP, human capital investment, and the dummies of the TRIPS agreement and the CAFC are also included. Moreover, economic linkage strength between the U. S and other countries are considered by using interaction terms in the econometric model. The regression results do not support that the IPR reform in other countries have promoted innovation in the U. S. The setting up of the CAFC has not had obvious influence, either. We devise some robustness checks to challenge that conclusion. We examine the GDP effect, lagged response to IPR reform, and the effect of time trend etc, and find that the result is credible. However, this paper indicates that U. S innovation was facilitated through domestic policy transformation around the TRIPS which came into force in 1995...|$|R
