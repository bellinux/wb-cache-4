25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes.

From the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head.
