A novel definition of the <b>technical</b> <b>surplus</b> on an insurance contract is proposed, and basic principles for its repayment as bonus are discussed. Making the experience basis an endogenous part of the model opens possibilities of model-based prognostication of future bonuses. Numerical illustrations are provided. Safety margins, prospective reserves, retrospective reserves, stochastic interest, stochastic mortality, counting processes...|$|E

Locations {{included}} Suffern High School, King's Daughters Library in Haverstraw and the Orchards of Conklin in Pomona. The producers held an actual science fair at the New York Penta Hotel in which participants received $75, and utilized the set for filming. The nuclear sets and effects were designed collaboratively by the production designer Philip Rosenberg, and Bran Ferren who is credited with the special effects. Ferren used literally tons of <b>technical</b> gear purchased <b>surplus</b> from Los Alamos National Laboratories, and performed most of the visual effects work, including robotics, live on set.|$|R
