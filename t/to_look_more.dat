5|$|The episode {{includes}} {{the debut of}} the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl. After the episode, it was moved into the Simpsons' basement, where it has since reappeared as a prop {{in the background of}} several episodes, although never in a major role. The design was partially based on real Olmec heads, but changed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> interesting and grotesque.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Qu√©bec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E
5|$|Sindy is a British fashion doll {{created by}} Pedigree Dolls & Toys in 1963. A rival to Barbie, Sindy's {{wholesome}} look {{and range of}} fashions and accessories made it the best-selling toy in the United Kingdom in 1968 and 1970. After Marx Toys' unsuccessful attempt to introduce Sindy in the United States in the late 1970s, Hasbro bought the rights to Sindy and remodelled the doll <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> American. As a result, the doll's popularity declined and Barbie manufacturer Mattel filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, which was settled when Hasbro agreed to remodel Sindy's face. During the 1990s, Barbie's share of the doll market continued to grow while Sindy's diminished, which led to Sindy being delisted from major retailers in 1997. Hasbro returned the doll's licence to Pedigree, and the doll was relaunched in 1999, manufactured by Vivid Imaginations. Sindy's 40th anniversary in 2003 saw a new manufacturer, New Moons, and another relaunch and redesign.|$|E

25|$|Superficial {{similarities}} between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes {{are thought to}} be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape. Although cuttlefish cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina (known as foveae), one <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> forward, and one <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, there is no blind spot, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina.|$|E

25|$|CBBC relaunched {{again in}} the autumn of 2007, with a new logo {{revolving}} around the letters of CBBC, each in a different style. A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 letters before coming together at the end. These scenes could involve cartoon figures, or stars of current CBBC programmes. In 2010 the logo was updated <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> 3D.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> European by {{the removal of}} the old box pews and the installation of new pews with cut-down ends. Two new columns were inserted in the nave to make the lines regular. The Wren-period pulpit by the joiner William Grey was opened up and provided with a soundboard and crucifix. Travers also designed the statue of St Magnus of Orkney, which stands in the south aisle, and the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the 3rd edition, Blood Bowl moved closer to the {{traditional}} Warhammer Fantasy Battle world by changing the miniatures <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> similar to their Warhammer Fantasy Battle counterparts. Jervis Johnson, designer of the game, has admitted this was not the best direction for the game, and has since stated that the Blood Bowl world is similar to, but definitely not the same as, the Warhammer world. Recent changes to the rules reflect this, and newer miniatures for the game look more sporty in nature.|$|E

The pants are made from rip-stop fabric, the undergarment made from cotton stretch which can be short sleeved or long sleeved and is to be worn under the ballistic vest. Baseball caps remained, although they are darker in colour than pre 2013. The new dark uniform was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> professional and to hide blood, dirt and sweat. The dark blue uniform was modelled after the Oxfordshire and Northumberland police attires.|$|E
25|$|Indian Princess and the Squaw are {{binaries}} {{of indigenous}} women's physical appearance.

She is youthful, energetic, innocent and usually a martyr willing to sacrifice herself for others. The squaw is looked upon negatively and more dark. She is usually the ugly sister to the Indian princess and is anything but innocent, she is probably promiscuous and has many children.|$|E
25|$|UK {{soap operas}} are shot on {{videotape}} {{in the studio}} using a multi-camera setup. Since the 1980s, these programs routinely feature scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on. During their early years, Coronation Street and Emmerdale used 16 mm film while scenes were shot on location. Later soap operas such as Hollyoaks and Family Affairs started filming on high-definition video, a more modern filming process, as opposed to standard videotape, which features better quality and appears <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like film than videotape.|$|E
