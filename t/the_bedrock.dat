5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> {{is made up of}} sandstone. South of the sandstone layer, there is a section of the watershed where <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is mudstone. In {{the central part of the}} watershed, <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is siltstone. In the southern part of the watershed, <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has bedrock of calcerous shale. A small area north of Berwick has limestone bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Widnes area is {{into the}} Mersey via Ditton, Steward's and Bower's Brooks. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> {{of the area}} is rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group. There are a few outcrops of sandstone but elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is covered by drift. Most of this consists of till except near {{the bank of the}} Mersey where it is recent alluvium.|$|E
5|$|The Runcorn area drains {{into the}} River Mersey {{to the north}} and the River Weaver to the south. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> of the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group; in the other areas <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is from the Mercia mudstone group. In places there are prominent outcrops of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> is covered by drift. At the northwestern periphery of the town the drift consists of recently blown sand. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent alluvium. Elsewhere the drift consists of till.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> of {{the upper}} part of the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is {{composed}} of granite formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya). <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> of the river as it flows through Tollymore is shale from the Silurian age, more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of basalt are found were molten basalt lava was forced through cracks in <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel from as far away as Antrim, Tyrone and Scotland, which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age.|$|E

30|$|The {{specific}} epithet “peridoticola” denotes <b>the</b> peridotite (ultramafic) <b>bedrock</b> {{on which}} this species grows on Mount Tambuyukon and Mount Kinabalu (from ‘peridotite’ <b>the</b> ultramafic <b>bedrock,</b> and; cola (Latin)—to dwell or inhabit). Peridotite is a dense, coarse-grained igneous rock, consisting of olivine and pyroxene minerals (magnesium-iron-silicates). This rock-type, to varying degrees serpentinised, is <b>the</b> main <b>bedrock</b> of ultramafic outcrops in Sabah, and forms the Mount Tambuyukon massif.|$|R
30|$|The {{acceleration}} waveforms of {{the virtual}} middle-size earthquake are calculated on <b>the</b> engineering <b>bedrock</b> with an S-wave velocity of {{greater than or equal}} to 600 m/s by applying the multiple reflection theory to the acceleration waveforms, which are simulated on <b>the</b> seismic <b>bedrock.</b> We assume <b>the</b> vertically incident S waves to <b>the</b> seismic <b>bedrock.</b> We utilize <b>the</b> subsurface structure model of the Chukyo area proposed by Horikawa et al. (2008) and apply the model from the upper surface of <b>the</b> seismic <b>bedrock</b> to <b>the</b> upper surface of engineering bedrocks. We also refer to the structural model of the Q-value at GIFH 09 (Hashima) obtained by the Japan Atomic Power Company et al. (2010) and Umeda and Kobayashi (2010).|$|R

5|$|Generally <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> of {{the west}} of the town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies to {{the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|Sampling of soil {{formed on}} the Marcellus bedrock showed the {{dominant}} mineralogy consisted of quartz, illite, montmorillonite, muscovite, and biotite, with phases of todorokite and trona appearing at depths closer to <b>the</b> <b>bedrock.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> {{is exposed}} on the ridges in the Black Creek watershed. The {{exposure}} {{is due to}} glaciofluvial deposits disappearing due to erosion and mining. There are many faults in the watershed's rocks.|$|E

30|$|Here {{we should}} {{emphasize}} the importance of the whole basin structure modeling down to <b>the</b> seismological <b>bedrock</b> in <b>the</b> EHVR inversion. As shown in the theoretical derivation of DFC, namely Eqs.  1 – 3, EHVR depends on the equipartitioned energy ratios at <b>the</b> seismological <b>bedrock,</b> αH/βH, and <b>the</b> transfer functions of P- and S-waves from there to the surface. This means that even in a high frequency range EHVR would be a function of the deep basin structure, not only a function of shallower sediments above <b>the</b> engineering <b>bedrock.</b>|$|R
30|$|Site {{amplification}} {{factors were}} computed {{to understand the}} seismic motion behavior on the different geological units in the study area. Since we determined the depth to <b>the</b> engineering <b>bedrock</b> at 29 sites, we used a common half-space layer for each site as <b>the</b> engineering <b>bedrock</b> with an average Vs of ~ 780  m/s. We did not observed engineering <b>bedrock</b> beneath <b>the</b> other 13 sites. We used <b>the</b> average engineering <b>bedrock</b> depth of neighboring sites in the amplification calculations for those sites.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> of {{the area}} {{consists}} of Permo-Triassic sandstones and particularly Triassic mudstones.

5|$|Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock {{consisting}} of shale and siltstone, laid down 450 {{million years ago}} during the Middle Ordovician. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy topsoils of the barrens.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
