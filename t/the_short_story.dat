50|$|Dickens's {{original}} artistic {{intent was}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> and <b>the</b> novels together, and <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> and <b>the</b> novels were published in 1840 in three bound volumes under the title Master Humphrey's Clock, which retains the original full and correct ordering of texts. However, Dickens himself cancelled Master Humphrey's Clock before 1848, and describes in a preface to The Old Curiosity Shop that he wishes the story to not be tied down to the miscellany within which it began. Most later anthologies published <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> and <b>the</b> novels separately.|$|R
5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez.

5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} about <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The {{story had}} long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two albums Valérian travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in Bad Dreams (Les Mauvais Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and {{sleeping in a}} stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school in his native village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first published work was <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal in writing <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> was {{to expose the}} corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God. It was originally {{meant to be a}} serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.|$|E
