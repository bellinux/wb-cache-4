5|$|During his Browns career, Lavelli was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} National Football League Players Association. The concept of a union to represent players in league matters was hatched in Lavelli's basement in 1954. Lavelli and two teammates, Abe Gibron and George Ratterman, met every Wednesday to discuss the union. They approached Creighton Miller, a Cleveland lawyer and former Notre Dame star who had worked briefly as an assistant coach with the Browns, for help. The union was founded at a meeting before the NFL championship game in 1956. The following year, the players got $50 per exhibition game, a $5,000 minimum salary, injury pay and medical care. <b>The</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> now the primary representative of players in labor negotiations and disputes with the NFL.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. <b>The</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{colored people}} did not intrude {{themselves}} upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities {{where they are now}} chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> wronged.|$|E

50|$|Reduction in {{the power}} of <b>the</b> trades <b>unions</b> <b>was</b> made gradually, unlike the {{approach}} of the Heath Government, and the greatest single confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>unions</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Union</b> of Mineworkers (NUM) strike of 1984-85, in which <b>the</b> miners' <b>union</b> <b>was</b> eventually defeated. There is evidence that this confrontation with <b>the</b> trade <b>unions</b> <b>was</b> anticipated by both the Conservative party and the NUM.

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{agreement between}} Magnús and Muirchertach is noted in several sources. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of the Four Masters {{reveal that the}} marriage to place in 1102. Other sources reporting the marriage include the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum, the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga, and Magnúss saga berfœtts within the thirteenth-century Heimskringla. The forms of Bjaðmunjo's name in these Scandinavian sources (Bjaðmunjo and Bjaðmynja) suggest that they may represent the Gaelic Bé Binn, a name {{known to have been}} borne by other members of the Uí Briain. Other Gaelic names equated to that of Bjaðmunjo include Ben Muman (or Ben Mumain), Blathmuine, and Bláthmín. Sigurðr was apparently twelve-years-old {{at the time of the}} marriage, although Bjaðmunjo's age is uncertain. The remarkably young age of the newlyweds, and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> recorded at all in historical sources, suggests that a dynastic marriage was required for the conclusion of peace between their fathers.|$|E
25|$|But {{advocates of}} the guild model argue that <b>the</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> {{laying the groundwork for}} {{long-term}} growth. <b>The</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> not only gaining members which enable it to advocate for changes in federal labor law to permit the unionization of independent contractors. <b>The</b> <b>union</b> <b>is</b> also setting the stage for the affiliation of potentially hundreds of thousands of these workers.
