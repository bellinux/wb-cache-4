25|$|Ketamine is {{absorbable}} by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and <b>topical</b> <b>routes</b> due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities. When administered orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, {{where it is}} biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through N-demethylation) and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine. As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent as an anesthetic, and plasma levels of this metabolite are three times higher than ketamine following oral administration. Bioavailability through the oral route reaches 17–20%; bioavailability through other routes are: 93% intramuscularly, 25–50% intranasally, 30% sublingually, and 30% rectally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within a minute intravenously, 5–15 min intramuscularly, and 30 min orally. Ketamine's duration of action in a clinical setting is 30 min to 2 h intramuscularly and 4–6 h orally.|$|R

40|$|Oral {{controlled}} release systems {{are the most}} popular one among all the drug deliverysystems. Mucoadhesive delivery systems offer several advantages over other oral controlledrelease systems by virtue of prolongation of residence time of drug, its targeting, and localizationof the dosage form at a specific site. These advantages include bypass of first pass metabolism ofthe drug and hence more concentration of the drug is available for absorption. Mucoadhesionoccurs between two surfaces, one of which is a mucous membrane and another is drug deliverysystem. These mucoadhesive systems are known to provide intimate contact between dosageform and the absorptive mucosa, resulting in a high drug influx through the absorbingtissue. Mucoadhesive formulations use polymers as the adhesive component. Mucoadhesive drugdelivery systems are available in the form of tablets, films, patches, and gels for oral,buccal,nasal, ocular, vaginal, rectal and <b>topical</b> <b>routes</b> for both systemic and local effects.

Micro-emulsions are currently of great technological and scientific importance to the researchers because of their potential to incorporate a wide range of drug molecules (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) due to the presence of both lipophilic and hydrophilic domains. These delivery systems provide protection against oxidation, enzymatic hydrolysis and improve the solubilization of lipophilic drugs and hence enhance their bioavailability. In addition to oral and intravenous delivery, they are amenable for sustained and targeted delivery through ophthalmic, dental, pulmonary, vaginal, and <b>topical</b> <b>routes.</b> They have been used to improve the oral bioavailability of various poorly soluble drugs.

This paper describes a non-invasive method to deliver steroids in therapeutic levels to the retina in rabbits. Dexamethasone was formulated as somewhat water-soluble dexamethasone/gamma-cyclodextrin (gammaCD) microparticles in a low-viscosity aqueous eye drop suspension. The mean (+/-standard deviation) diameter of the particles was 20. 4 +/- 10. 3 microm, with no particles larger than 60 microm. The aqueous suspension formulation was tested in rabbits and compared with an aqueous dexamethasone eye drop solution containing randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RMbetaCD). The dexamethasone concentration was identical in both formulations (15 mg mL(- 1)). The drug was administered to the left eye but determined in both eyes. The amount reaching different eye tissues via the <b>topical</b> <b>route</b> was determined by subtracting the amount found in the right eye from the amount found in the left eye. Two hours after single application of the dexamethasone/gammaCD eye drops to rabbits the mean (+/-s. d.) concentration in vitreous was 29 +/- 16 ng g(- 1), 86 % of which reached vitreous via the <b>topical</b> <b>route</b> and in retina the concentration was 57 +/- 22 ng g(- 1) (49 % via <b>topical</b> <b>route).</b> For the RMbetaCD the values were 22. 6 +/- 9 and 66 +/- 49 ng g(- 1) (73 and 14 % via <b>topical</b> <b>route),</b> respectively.

Although some systemic absorption can occur via <b>topical</b> <b>routes,</b> the clinical relevance is controversial. The effects of orally administered corticosteroids on intraocular pressure (IOP) and lens opacity (LO) are well established, but {{the impact of the}} INCS is less well defined. This study aims to systematically review the literature for evidence of adverse occular events with INCS use. Methodology: A systematic review of literature from Medline and Embase databases (January 1974 to 21 st of November 2013) was performed. Using the PRISMA guidelines, all controlled clinical trials of patients using INCS, that reported original measures of IOP, LO, glaucoma or cataract incidences were included. Studies with adjuvant administration of oral, inhaled and intravenous steroids were excluded. Results: 665 articles were retrieved with 137 were considered for full-text review. Of these, 116 (85 %) were literature reviews and two were case reports. 19 studies (10 RCTs, 1 case-control, 8 case series) were included for the qualitative review, of which 18 reported data on IOP and 10 on cataract/LO. None (n= 0) of the 10 RCT reporting data on glaucoma or IOP demonstrated changes in IOP compared to control.

Various highly sensitive techniques including quarz crystal microbalance (QCM), X-ray reflevtivity (XRR) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) {{are used to}} investigate the drug release over time into an aqueous media. Results The results reveal a steady drug release for both samples {{over the course of}} the experiments but with the release from the composite being significantly slower. In addition the dissolution rate of the clotrimazole sample initially increases up to 30 min after which a decrease is noted. XRR shows that this is a result of surface roughening together with film thickness reduction. The results for the composite show that the release in the composite film is a result of drug diffusion within the matrix and collapsing PS film thickness whereby XPS shows that the amount of clotrima-zole at the surface after 800 min immersion is still high. Conclusion It can be stated that the applied techniques allow following low mass drug release in detail which may also be applied to other systems like pellets or surface loaded nano-carriers providing information for processing and application rele-vant parameters.

Its current scale fermentative synthesis is sufficient, but it could be considered a bottleneck for a million ton scale breakthrough. Alternative chemical routes are therefore investigated using multifunctional, often heterogeneous, catalysis. Rather than summarizing yields and conditions, this review attempts to guide the reader through the complex reaction networks encountered when synthetic lactates from carbohydrate biomass are targeted.
