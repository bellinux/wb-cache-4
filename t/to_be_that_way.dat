2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, {{and one of the things}} he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> even in real life, because we're not allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E

2500|$|The {{problems}} {{of time and}} change {{was one of the}} main interests of the Ajivikas. Their views on this subject may have been influenced by Vedic sources, such as the hymn to Kala (Time) in Atharvaveda. Both Jaina and Buddhist texts state that Ājīvikas believed in absolute determinism, absence of free will, and called this niyati. Everything in human life and universe, according to Ajivikas, was pre-determined, operating out of cosmic principles, and true choice did not exist. The Buddhist and Jaina sources describe them as strict fatalists, who did not believe in karma. The Ajivikas philosophy held that all things are preordained, and therefore religious or ethical practice has no effect on one’s future, and people do things because cosmic principles make them do so, and all that will happen or will exist in future is already predetermined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> No human effort could change this niyati and the karma ethical theory was a fallacy. James Lochtefeld summarizes this aspect of Ajivika belief as, [...] "life and the universe is like a ball of pre-wrapped up string, which unrolls until it was done and then goes no further".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its unique epistemology, Marx's theory is built on concepts—such as forces and relations of production—that have no counterpart in classical political economy. Even when existing terms are adopted—for example, the theory of surplus value, which combines David Ricardo's concepts of rent, profit, and interest—their meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different. However, more fundamental to Marx's [...] "break" [...] is a rejection of homo economicus, or the idea, held by the classical economists, that the needs of individuals can {{be treated as a}} fact or [...] "given" [...] independent of any economic organisation. For the classical economists, individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a mode of production and as an independent starting point for a theory about society. Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs, Marx's analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently, Marx's Capital has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althusser's view, Marx does not simply argue that human needs are largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather, he abandons the very idea that there can be a theory about what people are like that is prior to any theory about how they come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep. Lindner claimed that the provision was a shield {{for the promotion of}} [...] homosexuality, “In some of the schools, we've got children as young as three, in pre-school, on up through the years that are being taught homosexual practices. And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But it's my understanding that gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E
