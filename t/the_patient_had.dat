40|$|Adrug-related problem exists when {{a patient}} {{experiences}} a disease or symptoms related to drug therapy. 1 In their model of pharmaceutical care, Strand and colleagues 1 defined 8 categories of drug-related problems: • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition requiring drug therapy (a drug indication) but is not receiving a drug for that indication. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which the wrong drug is being taken. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which too little of the correct drug is being taken. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition for which {{too much of the}} correct drug is being taken. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition resulting from an adverse drug reaction. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition resulting from a drug–drug, drug–food, or drug–laboratory interaction. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition as a result of not receiving the prescribed drug. • <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> a medical condition as a result of taking a drug {{for which there is no}} indication. Drug-related problems have become a major public health issue in North America. They are responsible for staggering annual rates of morbidity and mortality and are associated with enormous costs to the health-care system. Which health-care professionals are in the best position to influence this important problem? Can pharmacists exert an impact on the magnitude of drug-related problems? Can hospital pharmacists make a difference...|$|R

25|$|Swango did {{not often}} vary his methods of murder.

25|$|Nitrazepam {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery and the {{surgical}} implantation of hormones to reduce male sexual drive {{were classified as}} irreversible treatments {{that could only be}} carried out on consenting patients (section 57 of part IV of the Act); ECT was classified as a slightly less serious treatment that could be given to non-consenting patients if certain procedures were followed (section 58). <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> to be detained (if they were not already detained), then a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had to authorise treatment.

25|$|The next morning, at 8.30, Adams {{called the}} coroner {{to make an}} {{appointment}} for a private post-mortem. The coroner asked when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> died and Adams said she had not yet. Harris visited again that day and Adams still made no mention of potential barbiturate poisoning. When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6.00 a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7.23 a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett's death, on the 24th. It showed she had 115grains of sodium barbitone in her body – twice the fatal dose.|$|E
25|$|Working through {{abandonment}} {{depression is}} a complicated, lengthy and conflicted {{process that can}} be an enormously painful experience {{in terms of what}} is remembered and what must be felt. It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> adequate support for the emergence of the real self. There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient has ever known of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive that identity may be.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E

25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgery, and surgeons became increasingly open to surgery on the trachea. Despite this, {{the mortality rate}} failed to improve. From 1500 through 1832 there are only 28 known descriptions of successful tracheotomy in the literature. The first detailed descriptions on tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Vesalius wrote that the technique could be life-saving. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy after <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> been refused by barber surgeons. The patient apparently made a complete recovery and Brassavola published his account in 1546. This operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful tracheostomy, despite many ancient references to the trachea and possibly to its opening.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent {{description of the}} parathyroid glands is credited to Ivar Sandstrom, though his publication, On a New Gland in Man and Several Mammals-Glandulae Parathyroideae, received little attention. [...] Gustaf Retzius and Eugene Gley compounded his research, the latter credited {{with the discovery of}} the function of the parathyroid glands. [...] This research cumulated in the first surgical removal of a parathyroid tumor by Felix Mandel in 1925. A 2.5×1.5-inch (64×38mm) tumor was removed from the thyroid artery of a man suffering from advanced OFC. The patient's symptoms disappeared, only to return in approximately six years as a result of renal stones that were diagnosed only after <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> died. In 1932, blood tests on a female patient suffering from renal stone-based OFC revealed extremely high blood calcium levels. Fuller Albright diagnosed and treated the woman, who suffered from a large tumor of the neck as well as renal stones.|$|E
