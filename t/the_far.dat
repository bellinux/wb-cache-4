40|$|Reliability of the Fuzzy Association Rules (FARs) {{extraction}} is {{a challenging}} research in knowledge discovery and data mining. Reliability {{refers to the}} trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the rules diversity. In this paper, an approach called Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base (DFRB) is proposed to extract <b>the</b> <b>FARs</b> which are used later {{to predict the future}} values. This approach also aims to ensure high quality and diversity of <b>the</b> <b>FARs.</b> This is achieved through four phases: firstly, the integration of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Multiple Support Apriori (MSapriori) algorithms are applied to extract <b>the</b> <b>FARs.</b> <b>The</b> second phase calculates the correlation values for these FARs, and performs an efficient orientation for filtering FARs as a post-processing method. In the third phase, <b>the</b> <b>FARs</b> diversity is maintained through <b>the</b> clustering of <b>FARs,</b> based on <b>the</b> concept of the sharing function technique used in multi-objectives optimization. After that, the best and <b>the</b> most diverse <b>FARs</b> are evaluated and then stored in the Knowledge Base (KB). Finally, these <b>FARs,</b> stored in <b>the</b> KB, are utilized within the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for prediction. Experimental results for two case {{studies have shown that the}} proposed DFRB approach predicted the future values effectively, thus, outperforming the existing work...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>FARs</b> are {{organized}} into sections, called parts {{due to their}} organization within the CFR. Each part deals with {{a specific type of}} activity. For example, 14 CFR Part 141 contains rules for pilot training schools. The sections most relevant to aircraft pilots and AMTs (Aviation Maintenance Technicians) are listed below. Many of <b>the</b> <b>FARs</b> are designed to regulate certification of pilots, schools, or aircraft rather than the operation of airplanes. Once an airplane design is certified using some parts of these regulations, it is certified regardless of whether the regulations change in the future. For that reason, newer planes are certified using newer versions of <b>the</b> <b>FARs,</b> and in many aspects may be thus considered safer designs.|$|R
