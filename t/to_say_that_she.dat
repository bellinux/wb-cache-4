At this time, Deutsch began to turn {{her attention back to}} men’s psychology and narcissism in both sexes. Over time, she became increasingly devoted to the study of egoism and narcissism, thereby abandoning her lifelong study of feminism.|$|E
25|$|Guede {{originally}} {{said that}} Knox {{had not been}} {{at the scene of}} the crime, but he later changed his story <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been in the apartment at the time of the murder. He claimed that he had heard her arguing with Kercher, and that, glancing out of a window, he had seen Knox's silhouette outside the house.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, {{that from}} a {{rational}} point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> first contracted it and then was delivered. Proposing {{a solution to the}} theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it {{was the result of a}} more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.|$|E

25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was leaving him for Sloper.|$|E

[...] His entire life revolves around creativity, and that's something I could really relate to." [...] Kierszenbaum praised Kills' work ethic during the recording sessions, stating that she would focus simultaneously on the melodic and lyrical structure of song, {{as well as its}} soundscape. He went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] "influenced the timbre of the sound" [...] and assisted the production as if [...] "she's making a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Shelley {{frequently}} laments {{the poor}} education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt. She {{does not think}} much of the Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister Claire Clairmont, [...] "I do dislike the Germans—& never wish to visit Germany again—but I would not put this in print—for the surface is all I know." [...] Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, except <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was impressed by their public education system.|$|E

To cause tension between the friends Mercedes discovered Riley's relationship with Lynsey. Metcalfe said that her character gets [...] "such a shock" [...] but because of Mercedes' close friendship with Lynsey she [...] "might not react the way people expect". Metcalfe went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt her character's feelings for Riley have [...] "gone beyond love... it's an obsession now". She explained that Mercedes' plan was [...] "more destructive than winning him back", {{and that she was}} [...] "playing a game. The old Mercedes will be back shortly".|$|E
500|$|On {{her wedding}} day to Riley, Mercedes {{was the one who}} exposes the affair. Metcalfe said this was because when Mercedes looked into Riley's eyes she [...] "couldn't help it" [...] because of her love for him, and because Jacqui's {{entrance}} [...] "just tipped her over the edge". Metcalfe went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not think Mercedes [...] "thought about it" [...] when revealing the affair, but if she had thought it through she would not have revealed the secret. Metcalfe postulated that there would be [...] "huge repercussions" [...] from the events, explaining that her following storylines [...] "all stem from the wedding". Metcalfe added that she did not [...] "fancy" [...] the chances of a reunion for Mercedes and Riley although the actress would have liked one. Metcalfe commented that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline and with working with Norbury.|$|E
500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> still would very much like to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).|$|E

5000|$|Weil's first English biographer, Richard Rees, {{offers several}} {{possible}} explanations for her death, citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in Occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ.

500|$|Speaking of Sarah's {{death and}} Zoe's false imprisonment, Lister stated: [...] "She's {{in a very}} {{difficult}} place. She's lost her best friend and there's so much history there and she's finished her degree — well she didn't even finish her degree, she failed that — so she's in a limbo land anyway. She's working silly jobs and she's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life. Oh, and she's in prison on suspicion of murder..." [...] When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: [...] "Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her. She can't get her head around the fact that her best friend's dead and the fact that she's being accused of murdering her is ridiculous. She's worried that because it's got this far its ludicrous, so who's <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> won't be sent down?" ...|$|E
500|$|Marlohe based her {{performance}} as Sévérine around the mythological chimera, explaining {{that she wanted}} to emphasize a sense of [...] "dangerousness spreading through her" [...] while also [...] "creat a real human being with a range of emotions and the inner struggles we go through as human beings". When asked to define the traits of a Bond girl, she perceived the role as [...] "a powerful woman with a kind of male charisma and male power" [...] and a [...] "bit of animality". During promotional interviews, Marlohe advocated for the removal of the title of Bond girl, explaining that she aimed to imagine the character as more modern and realistic; she explained that the Bond girl is [...] "a beautiful concept but it's a concept, and I wanted to create a real human being". She went <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not want Sévérine to be simply labelled as a [...] "good Bond girl" [...] or a [...] "bad Bond girl". Despite this sentiment, she also felt that the character had a [...] "dark side".|$|E
500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E

500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|The song is also {{included}} in the set list of her the 2012 Born This Way Ball Tour. To Kwaak Je-yup of The Korea Times was positive about the performance of the song during the tour saying that, [...] "The highlight of the night was her first slow jam 'Hair,' which she introduced as her favorite track on the 'Born This Way' album... Playing the guitar-shaped keyboard, she flubbed her line once and admitted it right away — 'I'm getting too excited (that) I forgot my lines,' she said — but the moment made the experience personal." [...] On the second night of Gaga's show in the Philippines, she addressed the controversy directly before a slow-tempo version of [...] "Hair". While playing the piano she stated that she is aware of the issues around her image and music, she emphasized that she respects all kinds of religion, people and culture – including Filipino culture. She also said that she respects that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but stressed [...] "What I don’t respect is homophobia and hatred…I reject intolerance to the gay community." [...] This drew cheers from the audience. She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is aware some are using her name to spread hatred but intended to counter this by continuing to spread [...] "positivity" [...] in her own way.|$|E
50|$|To illustrate, we {{can take}} a {{dressmaker}} who purchased a dress material for 500 rupees, then stitched and put final touches on the dress. She then sold the dress for 800 rupees (her costs of finishing the dress were 150 rupees).We can then <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> added 150 rupees worth of output to the dress, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> produced 800 rupees worth of output. So value addition is equal to the sales price of a good or service, minus all the non-labour costs used to produce it.|$|R

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
