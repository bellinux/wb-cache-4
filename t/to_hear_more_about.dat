25|$|Of course, we may expect <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{this part}} of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1921, Phan studied Socialism and the Soviet Union {{in the hope of}} gaining {{assistance}} from the Soviet Union or socialist groups. He translated a book called [...] "An Account of the Russian Revolution", by Fuse Katsuji into Chinese. He then went to Beijing to meet with Soviet representatives, Grigori Voitinsky and Lap. Lap said that the Soviet Union would educate, train and pay for, any Vietnamese students Phan wanted to send, provided they would engage in social revolution and teach socialism in Vietnam afterwards. Lap was keen <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the political situation in Vietnam, since Phan was the first Vietnamese revolutionary to come into contact with them. Lap requested Phan write a book in English about the situation, but Phan was unable to do so as he spoke no English. Phan wrote of the Russians: [...] "One thing I cannot forget is how dignified, courteous, and sincere the Russians appeared to me. Their language and their expression was at times calm, at times vigorous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You talk quite feelingly," [...] said Angela, who {{was getting}} rather bored, and wanted, not unnaturally, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her own lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said March hastily, [...] "we've {{heard of}} him, {{but we want}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> {{particularly}} <b>about</b> him, for the accounts don't all agree." ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> that. All I {{want to know}} {{is whether}} anything belongs to me. My own clothes were burnt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes; but I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> crusts!' said Dora. 'And Jip {{must have}} a mutton-chop every day at twelve, or he'll die.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came down, sir," [...] said he, [...] "because {{our people}} in America {{would very much}} like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> this danger which is, in your opinion, {{pressing}} upon the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cummings {{had succeeded}} in {{interesting}} the boys despite Neal's assertion {{that it would be}} impossible to think of anything but their own condition, and Teddy asked, hoping <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the country: ...|$|E
60|$|Mercedes Higgins sighed cheerfully and for {{the time}} was lost in retrospection. Saxon was curious <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> this woman who must have lived much as the Spanish-Californians {{had lived in the}} old days.|$|E
60|$|I had {{had enough}} of the thing. I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it. Let them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don't want to get mixed up in it.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Patterson {{had driven}} away. He {{felt that he}} had done his duty in the face of fearful odds, and he did not want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Jacob Wheeler.|$|R
60|$|Guy went to London. Philip {{thought him}} very wilful, and his aunt very weak; and Mr. Edmonstone, on coming home, {{said it could}} not be helped, and he wished <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} mean enough," [...] she answered, [...] "to listen at the door, and I {{heard you talking}} of your father. I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> him. That is why I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Jacques, good-night," [...] said Harry, as {{the latter}} rose at last to depart; [...] "I'm delighted {{to have had a}} talk with you. You must come back to-morrow. I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> your friend Redfeather. Where did you say you left him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is indeed}} a small world," [...] the Marquis remarked. [...] "I will not inflict this family matter upon you all any longer. After lunch, perhaps, you will spare me {{a few moments of}} your time, Mr.--Mr. Thain. I shall be {{interested}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> this person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her. It is as Smeaton {{said of his}} lighthouse: her {{greatest}} real praise, when the novelty of her inauguration has worn off, is that nothing happens to keep the talk of her alive.' ...|$|R
60|$|Not wishing, apparently, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> such disagreeable {{characters and}} subjects, Manuela rose {{at the conclusion}} of the meal and retired to her apartment, while Lawrence continued to sip his coffee in a balcony which overlooked the vineyard behind the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here! You {{been doing}} {{a hell of a}} lot of insinuating and hinting around lately, as if I were leading a double life or something, and I'm damn sick of it, and I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, mamma, that {{my uncle}} Phillips talks of turning away Richard; {{and if he}} does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town." ...|$|E
60|$|Nat {{came in with}} Demi, soon {{followed}} by Ted and Josie, the Professor and his faithful Rob, all anxious <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> 'the boys'. The rattle of cups and tongues grew brisk, and the setting sun saw a cheerful company resting in the bright room after the varied labours of the day.|$|E
6000|$|She went {{indoors and}} rather coldly {{told her mother}} of the proposal. Mrs. Garland, though she had {{determined}} not to answer the miller's question on matrimony just yet, was quite ready for this jaunt, {{and in spite of}} Anne she sailed off at once to the garden <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it. When she re- entered, she said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do {{let me see}} you home. You are an {{intimate}} friend of the Chances, and I am so anxious, now that I have met Merton, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> something <b>more</b> <b>about</b> them. Perhaps you would not mind telling me {{what you know about}} their life and prospects." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ruth, dear," [...] {{interrupted}} the mother, [...] "I {{wish you would}} not worry me about the poor! They're a troublesome, ill-doing set; always grumbling, dirty, ill-natured, suspicious, and envious of the rich--as if it was our fault that we are rich! I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> anything <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Grandison," [...] said Mr. Morris, [...] "I'll {{give you}} a trial. If, {{at the end of}} six months, you can pay me the first instalment, I'll have the {{necessary}} papers made out, and you can go on and buy the place, but if you are not up to time on the first payment, I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the purchase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under {{the present}} circumstances, Mr. Pratt," [...] he said, [...] "I {{see no reason}} why you should leave us. I should like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> your {{wonderful}} good fortune and to discuss with you your plans for the future. If you are occupied now, perhaps this evening at home. My roses are worth looking at." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{thinking}} {{things over}} I suspect I {{was not intended}} to appreciate the merits of British Columbia too highly. Maybe I misjudged; maybe she was purposely misrepresented; but I seemed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> 'problems' and 'crises' and 'situations' in her borders than anywhere else. So far as eye or ear could gather, the one urgent problem was to find enough men and women to do the work in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was on {{the other}} side of the platform, miss; waiting for the train from London. I got to the station and gave him the telegram, just as the {{accident}} took place. We crossed over <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it. Mr. Mirabel was telling me that he would return to 'The Clink' on my horse--when he heard the woman's name mentioned. Upon that, he changed his mind and went to the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! May I be--skinned!" [...] said Sea Vitch, {{and they}} all looked at Kotick as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy. Kotick did not care <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{skinning}} just then; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: [...] "Isn't there any place for seals to go where men don't ever come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{light went}} out of the captain's eye. He leaned back on his bench and the little flush in his cheeks was succeeded by a somber coldness. [...] "Very good," [...] said he; [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it, and, what is more, it would not be right for you to tell me, even if I did want to know. It is none of my business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, uncle. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it. If {{you choose}} to be obstinate, and turn out, I {{can only say that}} I shall be sorry that the old house, where my father and you were both born, should go to wreck and ruin. At any rate, let the matter rest, for the present. Possibly it may yet be arranged to the satisfaction of all parties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You know it {{was while}} {{carrying}} little Selina downstairs, that she put her foot into the string of James's humming-top, and tumbled down all the stone stairs. She managed to save Selina--dear old Judy!--but she hurt her back most dreadfully, and she can't ever be well again, so papa gives her an allowance. She writes cheerfully, but we should like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her. We all were so fond of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got another}} idea," [...] said Henry, after a {{thoughtful}} pause. [...] "I {{got the news}} through White Buffalo. General Johnson has been commissioned to stir up the Indians in the Mohawk valley {{and get them to}} join in the attack on Fort Niagara. White Buffalo and his followers are going to join Johnson's force. Why not go with the white men in this crowd? We'll be sure <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> those Indians and the French traders in that way than if we went with the regular army." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{mentioned}} several {{persons who}} had {{a share in the}} settlement of our country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children what became of this upright and zealous man at last. In fact, his auditors were growing impatient <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the history of the chair.|$|E
6000|$|You must {{write me}} a good long letter after you get this. You have nothing else to do, and though it might not seem {{interesting}} to you after you had written it, {{it would be a}} good deal of company to me in this [...] "busy wilderness." [...] Tell your sister I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> selling out and moving. That gives me the [...] "hypo" [...] whenever I think of it.|$|R
50|$|There is {{historical}} and geographical information {{available on the}} official Mexican Bicentennial website. There is also available information for Communication routes and touristic places. People can also call a free number in order <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> information <b>about</b> the infrastructure project {{in just a couple}} minutes. Since many of the historical places had a different name in the past, there are guides with the past names and the current names of these places for better reference. There are also maps with the location of these places.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wish there}} were any {{likelihood}} of my soon seeing Primrose, Periwinkle, Dandelion, Sweet Fern, Clover Plantain, Huckleberry, Milkweed, Cowslip, Buttercup, Blue Eye, and Squash Blossom again. But as I do not know when I shall re-visit Tanglewood, and as Eustace Bright probably will not ask me to edit a third [...] "WonderBook," [...] the public of little folks must not expect <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> those dear children from me. Heaven bless them, and everybody else, whether grown people or children! ...|$|R
