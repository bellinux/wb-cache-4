5000|$|On March 17, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> played away to Newcastle Jets {{with the}} [...] {{playing at the}} same time against Adelaide United. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> went up 1-0 through a toe-poked goal by Berisha before a sublime free kick by Ali Abbas leaving Michael Theoklitos {{stranded}} to level the scores at 1-1. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> got a Penalty after a foul on Jack Hingert. Henrique took the penalty but it was hit poorly, making an easy save for Ben Kennedy. During the match, the Mariners scored through Bernie Ibini-Isei, meaning <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> have to win in order to keep their title hopes alive. They got another chance to take the lead when a foul on Erik Paartalu got another penalty for the away side. This time they benefited through Mitch Nichols, who scored the winning goal, leaving the race for the title {{to go down to the}} final round. Before that could happen, <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> travelled to China to face Beijing Guoan on Matchday 2. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> went down 1-0 in the 8th minute through Piao Cheng. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> scored 13 minutes later though, with a cross from Ivan Franjic being headed home by Mitch Nichols to level <b>the</b> score. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> dominated <b>the</b> rest of the first half but were not able to add to the 1 goal they had scored.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> {{is now at}} the {{forefront}} of her siege attack on Coldharbour and the Protector has been revived from the ocean floor, although it was fatally wounded by <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> and Carnac in their last battle. To defeat <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> and her two newborns, Helen must discover <b>The</b> <b>Roar's</b> weaknesses while Jenny transforms into a weapon to defeat <b>The</b> <b>Roar,</b> with <b>the</b> aid of Thomas' beauty. Deep down, the Unearthers are waiting day and night for Carnac, who awaits his mother's call for him to attack. Upon surfacing, Carnac is distracted by the Unearthers' but was quickly slain by the Protector with a swipe of his enormous arm - the only part of his body that the twins' and their helpers could free. However, Milo and the Protector are severely injured by <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> but Helen manages to find out <b>The</b> <b>Roar's</b> weaknesses. Jenny then proceeds to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Roar,</b> banishing her to the Moon. Despite Thomas' and the twins' best efforts to save the Protector, the gigantic silver being dies - though his last thought was in awe of Thomas and his beauty, which was perhaps even enough to save him if time had permitted. The children soon realize that, with the Protectors being nearly extinct, they are to serve as the new generation of defenders who will stand against and hunt beings like <b>the</b> <b>Roar,</b> saving other planets from impending doom.|$|R

5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E

5|$|They soon {{reverted to}} state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission {{used them to}} realize plans it had made a decade earlier, when it first {{designated}} the future Highway 82 through <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork Valley. With the Midland's tracks unused, it now had a graded route that could easily be adapted for highway purposes.|$|E
5|$|After the Spring Street {{intersection}} {{another two}} blocks past the courthouse, Main Street curves to the south, narrowing in the process. It {{is now a}} two-lane road. Two blocks to the south, SH 82 turns east again to follow East Cooper Avenue, crossing <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork again after another two blocks. The highway curves southward, leaving Aspen three-quarters of a mile (1.1km) further east.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E

5|$|The {{football}} match {{crowd at}} Hampden were renowned for creating <b>the</b> Hampden <b>Roar</b> {{and trying to}} terrify opposing teams. The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> could be heard whenever Scotland scored an important goal. After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced capacities, <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> has become more muted.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> Godzilla <b>roar</b> was revamped for the movie. According to Edwards, sound {{designer}} Erik Aadahl improved {{on the original}} sound effect provided by Toho. Aadahl and fellow {{sound designer}} Ethan Van Der Ryn spent six months over the three-year production getting <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> right. Using microphones that could record sound inaudible to humans, the team found sounds to match the initial shriek and the finishing bellow. <b>The</b> new <b>roar</b> retains <b>the</b> musical key and cadence of <b>the</b> <b>roar,</b> going from a C to a D. The final version was the 50th the team produced. The pair tested <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> on a back lot at Warner Bros., using a tour speaker array for The Rolling Stones, and estimated {{that it could be}} heard [...] away. In IMAX theatres, <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> was integrated into the sound of the [...] "Welcome to IMAX" [...] sequence shown before Godzilla showings.|$|R
5|$|During the Great Depression, {{another large}} public works project {{involved}} the pass. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) oversaw {{the construction of}} the Twin Lakes Tunnel, which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir, on Lincoln Creek, a southern tributary of <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork, to Twin Lakes, where it was used for irrigation purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the Rocky Ford and Ordway areas. Starting in 1935, 50,000 acre-feet (about 61.7 million m³) were made available this way.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{begins at}} Exit 116 from I-70 in Glenwood Springs, just 300ft (100 m) east of <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork's {{confluence}} with the Colorado River.

From there it crosses both I-70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past {{the train station}} into downtown Glenwood Springs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that four lanes at the western end was not enough. Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road to the south of it that crossed <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork to the east of the town.|$|E

50|$|Mid week <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> {{made their}} AFC Champions League debut {{at home to}} J-League outfit FC Tokyo. The match {{turned out to be}} a baptism of fire with <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> unable to contain the Japanese team, losing 2-0 with goals from Tatsuya Yazawa and Aria Jasuru Hasegawa. At the end of <b>the</b> week, <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> played at home again on the March 11, 2012 against then 2nd last team Adelaide United, with the chance to go equal first again after the Mariners drew 1-1 the {{previous}} week. With that in mind, <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> conceded first through a counterattack, with speedster Ian Ramsay opening the scoring via a low cross by Bruce Djite. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> were given some hope when in form striker Besart Berisha scored in the 70th minute. The hope in the match came to nothing however with the match ending 1-1. The hope, though, rolled over to the next match between the Central Coast Mariners and Perth Glory when an uncharacteristic error by Matt Ryan led to the only goal by Travis Dodd. The result meant <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> trailed top spot by 2 points with 2 games left in the regular season.|$|R
50|$|In Round 17, Franjic scored an {{equalising}} goal {{against the}} North Queensland Fury in the 85th minute. The game ended 1-1. This goal meant that <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> continued their undefeated run, extending it to 12 matches. Franjic played at right-back for <b>the</b> Brisbane <b>Roar</b> in <b>the</b> 2011 A-League Grand Final. <b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> were down 2-0 in extra time against the Central Coast Mariners before scoring two goals in under four minutes {{to send the}} match to a penalty shoot-out. Franjic scored the first penalty for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> who ended up winning 4-2 in the shootout after two saves from Michael Theoklitos.|$|R
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} its length. It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek was {{historically}} {{known as}} Popemetang, {{but it was}} known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers first arrived {{in the area in}} the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>Roaring</b> Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
50|$|Meyer {{then made}} his {{professional}} debut for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> on 12 January 2011 against the Central Coast Mariners at Central Coast Stadium. He {{came off the}} bench for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> in <b>the</b> 75th minute for Erik Paartalu and eventually scored the equalizing goal for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> which led to them drawing the match 3-3 in the 78th minute, three minutes after coming on. Meyer then scored his first brace in his next match against the Wellington Phoenix on 26 January 2011. He came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Mitch Nichols {{and then went on}} to score in the 83rd and 89th minutes of the game to grant <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> a late 2-0 victory. He then scored his fourth goal of his career and that very month on 29 January 2011 against the Melbourne Heart in which he found the net in the 62nd minute to hand <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> a 2-1 win.|$|R

50|$|The shootout {{was taken}} in front of <b>the</b> Brisbane <b>Roar</b> home end, with the Central Coast Mariners {{to take the first}} penalty kick. Veteran Mariners' and Maltese {{international}} midfielder, John Hutchinson took the first kick, which he converted, taking a deflection off Roar goalkeeper Michael Theoklitos. Brisbane Roar right back Ivan Franjic stepped up first for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> and duly converted his penalty, sending Mariners' goalkeeper the wrong way. Mariners' captain Alex Wilkinson and <b>the</b> <b>Roar's</b> goalscoring hero Erik Paartalu both converted their penalty kicks taking the score to 2-2. Mariners' striker Daniel McBreen then struck his shot well to the right of Theoklitos; however, <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> goalkeeper was equal to it and palmed the shot around <b>the</b> post. <b>Roar</b> captain Matt McKay then took his penalty successfully, giving <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> a 3-2 advantage. Right back Pedj Bojic took the Mariners' fourth penalty kick. Bojic's powerful strike looked destined for the top left-hand corner of Theoklitos' goal; however, the three-time A-League Goalkeeper of the Year pulled off a one-handed save to palm the ball over the bar and deny the Mariners for a second time in the shootout. With the score at 3-2 and <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> still having two penalty kicks in hand, this meant that the next penalty kick for <b>the</b> <b>Roar</b> would be enough. Brisbane's Brazilian winger Henrique stepped up and converted his penalty kick, beating the Mariners' keeper and Joe Marston Medalist Mathew Ryan to seal Brisbane Roar's first ever A-League Championship.|$|R
5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of <b>the</b> <b>Roaring</b> Fork.
