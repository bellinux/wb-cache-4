5|$|Following Kid, {{the group}} infiltrates Viper Manor {{on the night}} of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while {{unraveling}} the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.|$|E

Although this conviction was later overturned on appeal, he was again tried and convicted of jury tampering and extorting kickbacks from bars and nightclubs throughout Minneapolis.

25|$|The {{notebook}} Kid receives {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. We never see the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|E

During his freshman year, {{he won his first}} sizable film role in the teen action caper Catch <b>That</b> <b>Kid</b> (2004) about a girl and her friends who decide to rob a bank after learning that money is needed to aid her dying father, alongside Kristen Stewart and Max Thieriot. Although it was a box office flop, having only grossed $10 million, it served as an important step for Bleu, who was still building his acting career at the time. During high school, he performed in such student productions as Footloose and Grease, winning the honor of Theatre Student of the Year.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define kidding intervals and identify causes for long kidding intervals in communal area flocks. Two flocks were selected in the north-eastern part of Zimbabwe and were monitored over two years. Flock entries and exits were recorded, body-mass changes measured fortnightly and blood samples collected in five consecutive weekly intervals in August-September 1988 and March-April 1989. The average kidding interval for does <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in August-December (382 ± 90 days) was longer (P< 0. 01) than that for does <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in March-April (265 ± 48 days). The overall average kidding interval was 370 ± 122 days. Serum progesterone levels also indicated that of the 26 goats <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in October-December 1988, 65 % were non-pregnant 5 - 6 months after kidding. It is suggested that nutritional stress could be the cause of these long kidding intervals...|$|R

500|$|Kid Icarus had shipped 1.76 {{million copies}} {{worldwide}} by late 2003, and {{has gained a}} cult following. Game Informer ranked it the 83rd best game ever made in 2001. They claimed that despite its high level of difficulty and frustration, it was fun enough to be worth playing. The game has been met with mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication Nintendo Magazine System said <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> Icarus was [...] "pretty good fun", but did not [...] "compare too well" [...] to other platform games, owing in part to its [...] "rather dated" [...] graphics. Retro Gamer magazine's Stuart Hunt called Kid Icarus an [...] "unsung hero of the NES" [...] that [...] "looks and sounds pretty". He described the music by Hirokazu Tanaka as [...] "sublime", and the enemy characters as [...] "brilliantly drawn". Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success, he said <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> Icarus suffered from [...] "frustrating" [...] design flaws, such as its high difficulty level. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com expressed his disagreement with the game's status as an [...] "unfairly forgotten masterpiece" [...] among its substantial Internet following. He found Kid Icarus to be [...] "underwhelming", [...] "buggy" [...] and [...] "pretty annoying", and noted that it exhibited [...] "shrill music loose controls and some weird design decisions". Notwithstanding his disapproval of these elements, Parish said that the game was [...] " [...] terrible, or even bad – just a little lacking." [...] He recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version, if only because it allowed them to experience Kid Icarus [...] "with a fresh perspective".|$|E

[...] Jet magazine commented that although the Jackson family's musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience, Control was the turning point at which [...] "her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar. Control showcased Janet as a person who was firmly and finally in control of her own life." [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "Previously, she had recorded two unsophisticated, kiddie soul albums.

[...] Faced with a set of athletic brothers—Edward became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers.

[...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. My record company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there.

In spite of its brighter outlook, though, Indicud is still a Kid Cudi record." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters said, [...] "If you've heard a Kid Cudi album before, you probably know what you’re going to get from Indicud, and for those who have been patiently awaiting his latest release, that's great news. Indicud features some of Kid Cudi’s best songs to date, and is an overall enjoyable listen from start to finish." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "It's ass-backwards to make other people look the best on your solo album. Still, that might demonstrate the path of Kid Cudi isn't about being a rapper, a singer, or something in between. The point is, this record just proves <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> Cudi has a lot of sorting to do, and continuing down the same old path simply won’t cut it in the long-run." [...] Joe Gross of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Someday this Cleveland MC/producer/former weed enthusiast will find the lyrical and vocal charisma to match the scrumptiously dark, quasi-industrial tenor of his moody beats.

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But <b>that</b> <b>kid</b> could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, you know, and it's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Kipnis batted [...]371 with 14 {{home runs}} and 73 runs batted in. He {{finished}} second in the league with 24 stolen bases in 28 attempts. Kipnis primarily played center field, but played all outfield positions and second base; he batted leadoff part of the time. In 2008, Kipnis became the second Arizona State player to win the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Pacific-10 Conference Newcomer of the Year. (Teammate Ike Davis earned the award two years earlier.) Kipnis was named second-team All-America by the ABCA and named third-team All-American outfielder by Baseball America. In May 2008, he won the Pacific-10 Player of the Week award. In June, the San Diego Padres drafted Kipnis during the fourth round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. However, Kipnis opted to remain in college at Arizona State, becoming the seventh-highest player in the draft who chose not to sign. He decided not to sign with the Padres because he felt he hadn't fully matured and accomplished everything in college. Regarding Kipnis' success, Arizona State coach Pat Murphy observed: [...] "I love <b>that</b> <b>kid.</b> He's tough as nails, and really hard on himself." [...] Moreover, Paul DePodesta, San Diego Padres front office assistant and former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager, described him as [...] "a pesky player who is a very tough out, hitting the ball to all fields and running the bases aggressively ... plays very hard and is surprisingly strong." [...] In the summer of 2008, Kipnis played for the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape Cod League, [...] a collegiate summer baseball league located on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|After Serge {{returned}} home, FATE sent Lynx to kill Serge, {{hoping that}} it would release the Arbiter lock. Ten years after Serge drowned, the thief Kid—presumably on Belthasar's orders—went {{back in time to}} save Serge and split the dimensions. FATE, locked out of the Frozen Flame again, knew that Serge would one day cross to Another world and prepared to apprehend him. Lynx switched bodies with Serge to dupe the biological check of Chronopolis on the Frozen Flame. Belthasar then reveals that these events were part of a plan he had orchestrated named Project Kid. Serge continues to the top of Terra Tower and defeats the Dragon God. Continuing to the beach where the split in dimensions had occurred, Serge finds apparitions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca once more. They reveal that Belthasar's plan was to empower Serge to free Schala from melding with Lavos, lest they evolve into the [...] "Time Devourer", a creature capable of destroying spacetime. Lucca explains <b>that</b> <b>Kid</b> is Schala's clone, sent to the modern age to take part in Project Kid. Serge uses a Time Egg—given to him by Belthasar—to enter the Darkness Beyond Time and vanquish the Time Devourer, separating Schala from Lavos and restores the dimensions to one. Thankful, Schala muses on evolution and the struggle of life and returns Serge to his home, noting that he will forget the entire adventure. She then seemingly records the experience in her diary, noting she will always be searching for Serge in this life and beyond, signing the entry as Schala [...] "Kid" [...] Zeal, implying that she and Kid have merged and became whole again. A wedding photo of Kid and an obscured male sits on the diary's desk. Scenes then depict a real-life Kid searching for someone in a modern city, intending to make players entertain the possibility that their own Kid is searching for them. The ambiguous ending leaves the events of the characters' lives following the game up to interpretation.|$|E
