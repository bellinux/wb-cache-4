5|$|After {{sharing a}} romantic {{dance with the}} Beast ("Beauty and the Beast"), Belle discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror. The Beast {{releases}} her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to kill the Beast ("The Mob Song"). With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

25|$|Tanner's {{early and}} {{untimely}} death {{meant that he}} {{would never be able to}} mend the ill feelings that resulted from his disputes within his own party, particularly those that arose from his challenge to Shelby Cullom immediately preceding his death. His relationship with Chicago politicians had been consistently antagonistic over the years, and they felt no inclination <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> kindly.|$|E
25|$|Evans escorts Wade {{out of the}} hotel, and the two {{make their}} way across town, evading {{continuous}} gunfire from the combined gang and townsmen. Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train {{is not only to}} provide for his family, but to restore his own sense of honor, and give his sons something good <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a good reason for Canadians <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> To those of us who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E

By nature and by political preference he was a Democrat, but he was voted for simply as 'Paddy,' he was obeyed as 'Paddy,' and the people whom he had once autocratically governed, and a respectable portion of whom had been hostile <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as 'Paddy' <b>to</b> the day of his death." ...|$|R

25|$|The Superman of pre-Crisis Earth-17 was the {{original}} Overman, created by the government as were the other heroes of this Earth. Likewise, all other heroes that were created were modified clones of Overman's cell scrapings, such as versions of Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Some time later, Overman went on a homicidal rampage (due to an STD which had affected his mind) and murdered everyone on the planet before he decided to commit suicide and destroy the planet {{at the same time}} with a doomsday bomb. This world was destroyed, and Overman was wiped out by the Crisis, until the Psycho-Pirate began bringing back characters which the Crisis had killed in Animal Man #23, Overman and bomb included, despite trying not <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> Overman fought against Ultraman and Animal Man, before Overman was dragged out of the comic book panels and wiped out by a closing panel, ranting that it wasn't his fault he was like that before Animal Man disarmed the bomb. In The New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-17 is the world of the Atomic Knights and lacks a known Superman analogue.|$|E
500|$|On {{the sixth}} {{anniversary of the}} death of Ojeda Ríos, the EPB held a vigil <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> Making a call to the masses to stop {{listening}} to a small group of leaders and advocating against political eclecticism and inter-ideological alliances, the organization urged the public {{to take control of the}} class war and employ armed resistance to accomplish independence. The group criticized those that oppose armed conflict as lacking the theoretic knowledge and being unaware of the basic structure, methodology, politic-military concepts and a scientific analysis to understand the conditions precipitated by the political status of Puerto Rico. Citing [...] "500 years of colonial experience" [...] and [...] "the waste of time that colonial elections have been", the EPB stated that [...] "it is time to jump from the defensive to the offensive" [...] in order to provide stimuli to the masses. By arguing that elections [...] "divide the left [...] towards immovilism", the group expressed that there was a need for an"ideological capacitation", remembering that Ojeda Ríos was influenced by Betances, Corretjer, Albizu Campos, CAL, ARP, MIRA, los Voluntarios, FALN and COR. When discussing their perception of a class war, the EPB listed the police, FBI, Homeland Security and the National Guard as [...] "repressive forces" [...] that they directly oppose.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{suffered}} a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001, {{resulting in a}} broken hip. The fracture was repaired the following day and the 89-year-old Reagan returned home later that week, although he faced difficult physical therapy at home. On February 6, 2001, Reagan {{reached the age of}} 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover, with Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter later reaching 90). Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that [...] "Ronnie would want people <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> as he was." [...] After her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy Reagan became a stem-cell research advocate, urging Congress and President George W. Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, something Bush opposed. In 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for lifting restrictions on such research. Nancy Reagan said that she believed it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.|$|E

500|$|Gray's {{life was}} {{surrounded}} by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded {{a few days later}} by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh {{in the minds of the}} Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he [...] began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter into a sort of rebirth cycle or, should he die, if there would be anyone <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 32 {{is highly}} {{dependent}} upon {{the relationship between the}} subject and speaker of the sonnet. [...] The speaker of the sonnet reflects upon [...] "his own mortality" [...] in comparing himself to the young man whom he loves, whether romantically or in friendship it is unclear. [...] The speaker refers to himself as the [...] "deceased lover" [...] which is significant as it highlights the age difference between the two men, a perpetual theme throughout Sonnet 32 as well {{as the rest of the}} handsome youth sonnets. [...] After accepting, his eventual death, the speaker takes on a [...] "self-deprecating" [...] tone referring to his poetry as [...] "poor rude lines" [...] (4) and beseeching the youth <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> after his death. [...] This emphasis on his failure in poetry is imperative as it frames the rest of the sonnet and the speaker's request for the young man <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> [...] "for his love" [...] (14).|$|E
50|$|The sacrament {{is viewed}} by adherents as a renewal of a member's {{covenant}} made at baptism.

Tacitus described Vonones II as “he knew neither success nor failure which have deserved <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It was a short and inglorious reign”.|$|R
