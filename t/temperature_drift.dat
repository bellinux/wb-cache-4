The device comprises an array of 32 Mach-Zehnder interferometers implemented with microphotonic spirals of linearly increasing length.

50|$|Stripers are migratory, {{and will}} {{move up and}} down the coasts and into river systems to spawn, and back out to sea {{throughout}} the year. But close in to the shoreline, the bite begins when the water reaches 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the spring, tapers off as the hot summer approaches, and returns in force in the fall.

An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, {{is a combination of}} initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>drifts</b> of zero and sensitivity—electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from ±0.01-2° depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.|$|R

A pronounced phase-transition-like narrowing of the emission profiles occurs immediately after the sample is cooled down to 77 K. The room temperature profiles reappear again abruptly and almost reversibly as the <b>temperature</b> <b>drifts</b> freely back to approximately the ice point after the filling of liquid nitrogen is stopped.

40|$|Synaptic {{homeostasis}} is {{a mechanism}} present in biological neural systems that acts {{to maintain an}} homogeneous and stable computational substrate, in face of intrinsic inhomogeneities among neurons, and of their continuous changes due to learning processes and variations in the statistics of the input signals. In hardware spike-based neural networks homeostasis could be useful for solving issues such as mismatch and <b>temperature</b> <b>drifts.</b> Here we present a synaptic circuit that supports both spike-based learning and homeostatic mechanisms, and show {{how it can be}} used in conjunction with a software control algorithm to model global synaptic scaling homeostatic mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Naval gun {{fire control}} {{potentially}} involves {{three levels of}} complexity. Local control originated with primitive gun installations aimed by the individual gun crews. Director control aims all guns on the ship at a single target. Coordinated gunfire from a formation of ships at a single target was a focus of battleship fleet operations. Corrections are made for surface wind velocity, firing ship roll and pitch, powder magazine <b>temperature,</b> <b>drift</b> of rifled projectiles, individual gun bore diameter adjusted for shot-to-shot enlargement, and rate of change of range with additional modifications to the firing solution based upon the observation of preceding shots.|$|E
50|$|The oven is a thermally-insulated {{enclosure}} {{containing the}} crystal {{and one or}} more electrical heating elements. Since other electronic components in the circuit are also vulnerable to <b>temperature</b> <b>drift,</b> usually the entire oscillator circuit is enclosed in the oven. A thermistor temperature sensor in a closed-loop control circuit is used to control the power to the heater and ensure that the oven is maintained at the precise temperature desired. Because the oven operates above ambient temperature, the oscillator usually requires a warm-up period after power has been applied. During this warm-up period, the frequency {{will not have the}} full rated stability.|$|E

The end of one core is selectively coated with a reflective surface and is used as the reference arm; the other core serves as the sensing arm. The detection of surface acoustic waves, microdisplacements, and magnetic fields is reported. The sensor is shown to be highly stable in comparison to a classic homodyne, uncompensated Michelson interferometer, and signal-to-noise ratios of 65 dB have been obtained...|$|R

Algorithms for calibration of components like the vector modulator for the phase reference and the gradient detector are described. The calibration will be performed in a dedicated test stand which will be completely automated. The microprocessor in the control modules allows running of complex algorithms to achieve phase lock and optimize system gains for minimum residual errors for different gradients and beam loading...|$|R

More sophisticated fire control systems consider more of these factors rather than relying on simple correction of observed fall of shot. Differently colored dye markers were sometimes included with large shells so individual guns, or individual ships in formation, could distinguish their shell splashes during daylight. Early [...] "computers" [...] were people using numerical tables.|$|E
5000|$|When summing a PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) and a CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) current, {{only the}} linear terms of current are compensated, while the higher-order terms are {{limiting}} the TD (<b>Temperature</b> <b>Drift)</b> of the BGR at around 20ppm/oC, over a temperature range of 100 oC. For this reason, in 2001, Malcovati [...] designed a circuit topology that can compensate high-order non-linearities, thus achieving an improved TD. This design used an improved version of Banba [...] topology and {{an analysis of}} base-emitter temperature effects that was performed by Tsividis in 1980. In 2012, Andreou [...] has further improved the high-order non-linear compensation by using a second opamp along with an additional resistor leg {{at the point where}} the two currents are summed up. This method enhanced further the curvature correction and achieved superior TD performance over a wider temperature range. In addition it achieved improved line regulation and lower noise.|$|E
50|$|Some sensors {{now offer}} an {{integrated}} signal processor {{that attempts to}} correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the speed sensor. On a module m = 1 target wheel these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional speed sensors on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 target wheel the new speed sensors can tolerate gap {{of as much as}} 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the phase displacement between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and <b>temperature</b> <b>drift.</b> In addition, in spite of the complex electronics it has also been possible to increase the mean time between failures for the new speed sensors by a factor of three to four. So they not only provide more precise signals, their signal availability is also significantly better.|$|E
