5|$|Between 70K {{and room}} temperature, {{berkelium}} behaves as a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E

25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black–Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> of this model.|$|E

500|$|Boyd {{was born}} to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border {{of the state of}} Georgia. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are [...] "rather imperfect", that annealing caused [...] "no appreciable change" [...] in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the mass absorption coefficient of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> calculated using Compton's empirical formula.|$|E

2500|$|Irwin I. Shapiro {{proposed}} another test, {{beyond the}} classical tests, {{which could be}} performed within the Solar System. It is sometimes called the fourth [...] "classical" [...] test of general relativity. He predicted a relativistic time delay (Shapiro delay) in the round-trip travel time for radar signals reflecting off other planets. The mere curvature of {{the path of a}} photon passing near the Sun is too small to have an observable delaying effect (when the round-trip time is compared to the time taken if the photon had followed a straight path), but general relativity predicts a time delay that becomes progressively larger when the photon passes nearer to the Sun due to the time dilation in the gravitational potential of the Sun. Observing radar reflections from Mercury and Venus just before and after it is eclipsed by the Sun agrees with general relativity theory at the 5% level. More recently, the Cassini probe has undertaken a similar experiment which gave agreement with general relativity at the 0.002% level [...] However, the following detailed studies [...] revealed that the measured value of the PPN parameter gamma is affected by gravitomagnetic effect caused by the orbital motion of Sun around the barycenter of the solar system. The gravitomagnetic effect in the Cassini radioscience experiment was implicitly postulated by B. Berottti as having a pure general relativistic origin but its <b>theoretical</b> <b>value</b> has been never tested in the experiment which effectively makes the experimental uncertainty in the measured value of gamma actually larger (by a factor of 10) than 0.002% claimed by B.
