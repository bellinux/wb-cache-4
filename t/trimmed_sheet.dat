40|$|The {{processes}} {{significantly affect}} {{the productivity of}} printing and packaging machines. The process of transporting the sheet material begins with its separation from the stack, move into the treatment zone and outputting to the receiving table. The aim of this work {{is to determine the}} possibility of pre-analytical method without the element to be contacted cutting sheet material, its transport and fixation in the cutting zone due to the vacuum chamber. The advantage is that the vacuum transport, that the sheet material does not operate mechanical strength. Also semi-products are not deformed or damaged actuators conveyors. Using the method without the element to be contacted <b>trimming</b> <b>sheet</b> material cutting tool eliminates contact with the contacting element. Since the blade is in contact directly with only semi-finished product that it can be assumed that its bluntness is minimized, and the streamlined design of the transport system greatly simplifies the implementation of the technological process of pruning. ??????????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ??????????? ?????. ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??? ????????? ?? ?????, ??????????? ? ???? ????????? ? ?????? ?? ???????? ????. ????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?????????, ??? ??????????????? ? ???????? ? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ????????? ??????. ????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????? ??, ??? ?? ???????? ???????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ????, ??? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????. ????? ???? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ? ?? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????. ????????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ??????????????, ?? ????? ????????????, ??? ??? ?????????? ???????? ? ????????, ? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} are stripped of interior fixtures, trim, plastic, lights, and glass. They are repainted, often in loud, garish designs and on low budgets (spray paint is frequently used to mark names, slogans and identification). Additional modifications include <b>trimming</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{from around the}} wheel wells, removing parts of bumpers, welding the doors shut, and relocating the battery and gas tank. The radiator is sometimes relocated to the back seat. To make the cars last longer, they are occasionally pre-bent, with frames notched, rear bumpers removed, trunk lids notched, and rear coil springs are (when rules allow) replaced with leaf springs. In many instances, roll bars, fire extinguishers, and other safety equipment is installed.

40|$|International audienceCrack {{propagation}} and deviation during <b>trimming</b> {{of aluminium}} <b>sheet</b> metal have been analysed experimentally and modelled by a {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). The experimental results may be summarized as follows. Two crack propagation mechanisms operate in aluminium sheet metal, i. e. either between adjacent voids or by multiple coalescence of micro-cracks. A fracture process-zone may be identified for both mechanisms. Outside this fracture process-zone, no damage is observed. The particular crack propagation mechanism does not influence the crack path. A mechanical model based on a two steps analysis is presented. In the first step, the overall stress strain field prior to cracking is determined by an explicit Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation based FEA. In the second step, dedicated to crack propagation, no remeshing is used. A cumulative damage model based on the equivalent plastic strain increment is shown to be very efficient. The damage variable is interpreted as bifurcation {{in the direction of}} the maximum plastic strain rate. Finally, the applications show the possibility of <b>trimming</b> aluminium <b>sheet</b> metal without sliver generation...|$|R

In several minutes one called down that everything was ready, and all went on deck. Hoisting mainsail and jigger was a matter of minutes. Then the cook and cabin-boy broke out anchor, and, while one hove it up, the other hoisted the jib. Hastings, at the wheel, <b>trimmed</b> the <b>sheet.</b> The Roamer paid off, filled her sails, slightly heeling, and slid across the smooth water and out the mouth of New York Slough. The Japanese coiled the halyards and went below for their own dinner.|$|R

50|$|Winch-a geared {{mechanical}} device used on yachts for <b>trimming</b> (adjusting)sail <b>sheets,</b> for hoisting large sails with halyards, for hauling in an anchor or {{on a boat}} trailer for hauling a boat out of the water. The normal turret winch is set on the aft side deck for trimming headsails and or a spinnaker. Manual trimming winches are operated by grinding the handle in a circle initially, then pulling back and forwards on a short lever while a second person tails (pulls to keep tension on the sheet)to obtain optimum force. Some winches are self-tailing or the sheet can be cleated to prevent slippage. On larger yachts winches can be operated by electric motors. Typically on America's cup yachts large pedestal winches are used which can be operated by two people at the same time. Because of the force needed, especially in tacking duels, winch grinders are usually very large and strong men.|$|R

60|$|There {{are times}} at sea when human nature revolts from the strain that the overtaxed body must bear, the leaden weariness of {{worn-out}} limbs, and the subconscious effort to retain warmth and vitality {{in spite of}} the ceaseless lashing of the icy gale. Then, as aching muscles grow lax, the nervous tension becomes more insupportable, unless, indeed, utter weariness breeds indifference to the personal peril each time the decks are swept by a frothing flood, or a slippery spar must be clung to with frost-numbed and often bleeding hands.

40|$|Within {{industry}} {{there is}} an established need for enhanced virtual tools and methods to improve product tolerance setting and conditions for successful manufacturing of non-rigid assemblies.

This paper reports experiences and findings made during recently performed virtual matching and <b>trimming</b> of <b>sheet</b> metals in a real automotive industrial setting. A case is presented, demonstrating the possible use of the Computer Aided Tolerance(CAT) tool RD&T, (Robust Design & Tolerancing), in order to predict the geometric behavior of non-rigid parts when assembled. Scanned parts are used as input and the analysis is performed using the described virtual platform instead of physical type-bound rigging equipment traditionally used for conflict, gap and final springback analysis. The proposed working procedure, and the reasons behind it, are presented. The need of additional radical and incremental innovations is brought into light, in order to make earlier predictions in the product realization process. Furthermore, it is discussed whether the necessary changes in working procedures can impose innovation barriers in the future...|$|R

50|$|Reefing a junk rigged sail is very easy. When sailing {{close to}} the wind, {{all that is needed}} is to ease the halyard. As the sail lowers by its own weight, the other running lines will also relax. The sail is lowered until the desired batten is along the boom.
