5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>and</b> {{medicine}} for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that {{a brain tumor}} has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E

25|$|July 19: Joseph Bradehoft, 25. Dahmer's last victim. Bradehoft was {{a father}} of three {{children}} from Minnesota who was looking for work in Milwaukee {{at the time of}} his murder. He was left on Dahmer's bed for two days following his murder before, on July 21, being decapitated. His head was placed in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>and</b> his torso in the 57-gallon drum.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, Dahmer {{encountered}} 24-year-old Oliver Lacy at {{the corner}} of 27th and Kilbourn. Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive; after unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform, he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>and</b> his skeleton in the freezer. Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired. Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator. He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.|$|E
500|$|The {{next few}} loops feature a {{refrigerator}} {{hanging from the}} ceiling, leaking blood, the muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>and</b> it violently shakes and moves, implying that the baby is trapped inside. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, and the character moves abnormally quickly, {{with a set of}} disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature addressing the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then landed a part-time cashier job in order to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering [...] "204863" [...] repeatedly and the player's perspective distorts, before the game displays a false crash message.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1910, dietary fats {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} butterfat, beef tallow, and lard. During Napoleon's reign in France {{in the early}} 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk; it did not gain acceptance in the United States. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the United States {{as a source of}} protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the [...] "need" [...] (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>and</b> immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat. Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry, sold in England, began to replace butter and lard in the baking of bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920.|$|E

5000|$|Refrigerator Portrait Series (2001) - In {{this series}} Kina {{comments}} on class, family, and identity, by creating trompe-l’oeil depictions of household <b>refrigerators.</b> <b>The</b> <b>refrigerators</b> are titled after their owners, {{all members of}} Kina's extended family. The paintings convey something about their owners' identities through magnets, drawings, and other items appearing on their doors. This series deals with the ever-blurring boundaries between race, religion, and national identity. One of the paintings, titled [...] "The Rosenfelds," [...] depicts a high end Sub-Zero refrigerator made of shining steel and surrounded by custom wood cabinetry. Unlike the other works in this series, this refrigerator’s surface is unadorned. In its stark simplicity, its formal presence invokes the work of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. “While the variety of adornments on the Kina-Aronson fridge indicates a multiplicity of identities, the interiors of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> <b>and,</b> by extension, <b>the</b> inner lives of their owners, remain closed to the viewer”.|$|R
