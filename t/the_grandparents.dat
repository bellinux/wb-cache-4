40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} delay of grandparenthood in East and West Germany, investigating how {{the timing and}} life-course context of this transition have changed across cohorts. The authors estimated the timing of passages into <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> role as well as demographic overlap with worker, parent, and filial roles. Data from the German Aging Survey (N = 3, 628) revealed a rise of 3 months per birth cohort (1929 - 1958) in the median age at grandparenthood. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> role decoupled almost entirely from active parenthood. Overlap with worker and filial roles was frequent and remained stable across cohorts. The findings direct attention to a neglected demographic trend that is striking in scope and precipitates change not only in <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> role but also in kinship structure...|$|R

25|$|Anioma social {{structure}} {{is dominated by}} the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of uno, eboh', and idumu, which are major blood lineages; while ogbe and obodo are open and much more political. Uno is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was Eboh, which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and <b>the</b> <b>grandparents</b> and the grandchildren. The Ogbe is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the Idumu and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks like a small town; this is the Obodo.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of given names follows trends, with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, few children born since 1970 would bear the name Germaine, {{which is generally}} associated {{with the idea of}} an elderly lady. However, as noted above, such old-fashioned names are frequently used as second or third given names, because in France the second or further given names are traditionally those of the godparents or <b>the</b> <b>grandparents.</b> Some older names, such as Suzanne, Violette, and Madeleine, have become fashionable again in the upper class and in the upper middle class. Others such as Jean, Pierre, Louis, and François never really went out of fashion. Alexandre (Alexander) was never very popular, but is not uncommon in middle and upper classes.|$|E

25|$|The {{mainstream}} Nazi anti-Semitism {{considered the}} Jewry being {{a group of}} people bound by close, so-called genetic (blood) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews was declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, to rectify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared from that, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the so-called Aryan race. Paradoxical was, that never genetic tests or outward allegedly racial features in one's physiognomy determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis palavered a lot about physiognomy, but only the records of religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided. However, while <b>the</b> <b>grandparents</b> were earlier still able to choose their religion, their grandchildren in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, if three or four grandparents were enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation. This Nazi categorisation as Jews of course included mostly Jews of Jewish descent, but also many Gentiles of Jewish descent, such as Catholics, irreligionists, and Protestants, who happened to have had grandparents belonging– according to the records– to a Jewish congregation. While Jewish congregations in Germany tried– little as they were allowed– to help their persecuted members, the Protestant church bodies ignored their parishioners who were classified as Jews (according to the Nuremberg Laws), and the somewhat less persecuted Mischlinge of partially Jewish descent.|$|E

40|$|Fertility {{postponement}} {{and mortality}} decline are shifting the demography of <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> population in Canada. The {{ways in which}} the aging of <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> population affects families depends in large part on <b>the</b> health of <b>grandparents.</b> In this article, we document the aging of Canadian grandparents between 1985 and 2011. However, despite being older, grandparents are healthier, signaling that the compression of morbidity is outpacing the postponement of grandparenthood. This shift is partly due to the higher educational attainment of this population and partly due to secular improvements in health over time. The improved health of grandparents in Canada has important implications for intergenerational transfers and relationships...|$|R

We use a dataset where we are able to link individual measures of life time earnings for three generation and data on educational attainments of four generations. We first do conventional regressions and transition matrices for life time earnings measures and educational attainments adding variables for <b>the</b> <b>grandparent</b> and great grandparent generations, respectively. We find that grandparents and even great grandparents significantly influence earnings and education. We then estimate the so called Becker-Tomes model using the educational attainment of <b>the</b> great <b>grandparent</b> generation as an instrumental variable. We fail to find support for the model’s predictions. Intergenerational income mobility; earnings distribution; income inequality...|$|R
