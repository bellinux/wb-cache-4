5|$|Match, non-friction: The {{earliest}} type {{of match}} for lighting fire {{was made in}} China by 577 AD, invented by Northern Qi (550–577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials <b>to</b> <b>light</b> fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of Northern Zhou (557–581) and the Chen Dynasty (557–589) besieged their city from outside. Early matches in China were designed to be lit by an existing flame and carried <b>to</b> <b>light</b> another fire. They were pinewood sticks impregnated with sulfur and needed only a slight touch from a flame <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> This {{was written in the}} Records of the Unworldly and Strange by Tao Gu in 950 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period).|$|E
5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe.

5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond <b>to</b> <b>light</b> even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} not yet been {{approved}} by 11 of the 14 states, the ratification of Article One (ratified by 10) and Article Two (ratified by 6) remained incomplete. The ratification plateau they needed to reach soon rose to 12 of 15 states when Kentucky joined the Union (June 1, 1792). On June 27, 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly ratified all 12 amendments, however this action did not come <b>to</b> <b>light</b> until 1996.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff <b>to</b> <b>light</b> brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White <b>to</b> <b>light</b> brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E

5|$|Closely related <b>to</b> <b>light</b> {{deflection}} is {{the gravitational}} time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E

5|$|Due to Paula's small size, {{impact in}} Mexico was minor, mainly limited <b>to</b> <b>light</b> {{rainfall}} and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward {{and fell to}} tropical storm intensity on October14. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. Early on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68mph (109km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited <b>to</b> <b>light</b> rainfall and increased tides.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescent {{lighting}} converts ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>to</b> visible <b>light.</b> In order <b>to</b> produce ultraviolet <b>light,</b> electrons {{flow through}} the fluorescent lamp and collide with mercury atoms. The collision with mercury causes photons of UV <b>light</b> <b>to</b> be released; the UV light is then converted <b>to</b> visible <b>light</b> as it passes through the phosphor coating in the glass tube.|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} after its discovery, the {{evolutionary}} origins of Triceratops remained largely obscure. In 1922, the newly discovered Protoceratops was seen as its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades passed before additional findings came <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} perceptual {{attributes}} {{that are relevant}} <b>to</b> <b>lighting</b> research. Of primary interest to us are those such as brightness and uniformity, which relate closely to physical quantities, and atmosphere metrics such as coziness and tenseness, which are affective evaluations of an environment that are strongly influenced by lighting changes. Atmosphere terms and assessments were originally outlined by Vogels [15], and their relationship <b>to</b> <b>lighting</b> characteristics were studied by Vogels, Seuntiens, and others [16, 17]. Other, secondary perceptual attributes relevant <b>to</b> <b>lighting</b> may include color rendition, glare, and appropriateness for a task or space, but these were considered out of scope for this stage of research.|$|R
