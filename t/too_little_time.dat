500|$|Frederick had {{benefited from}} an obliging enemy. First, Charles {{saw what he}} wanted to see {{regarding}} the principal attack instead of using his efficient light cavalry {{to figure out what the}} Prussians really intended. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered the truth. The cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a screen, a diversion, to hide his real movements. Second, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy's omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising failure for a man with his long years of experience against the Prussians; he should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was Frederick's modus operandi. [...] Third, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to mesmerize Charles.

500|$|The {{alcohol in}} beer comes {{primarily}} from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation.

2500|$|Urwin {{determined}} that Rockefeller's negatives created public perceptions of [...] "his personal flaws, {{rather than his}} accomplishments or lack of them, as governor." [...] Considered a weak administrator, he depended too heavily on staff, so improperly managed that the employees often failed to answer mail. He was habitually tardy to meetings. A special legislative session in May 1968 was particularly disastrous. An Oliver Quayle poll in 1968 declared that Rockefeller seemed “strange, alien, and foreign” to many voters. The poll maintained that many thought Rockefeller sought too much power, that he drank too much, and that he spent <b>too</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in his office.

This produced a storm of protest with a faction arising that supported for the leadership Colin Crawford (who had been on both the 1922 expedition and the 1933 expedition). Taken aback, Ruttledge resigned again. Unable to continue with Ruttledge but unwilling to appoint Crawford, who many on the committee saw {{as the cause of}} the trouble, as late as March 1935 the leadership was being offered to at least seven other people, all of whom declined. The committee was forced into a difficult meeting to interview Ruttledge and Crawford for the position and the subsequent vote was a tie, resolved by the chairman voting for Ruttledge. Further rancour led to Crawford being removed from the committee, Strutt resigning in protest, and a number of resignations from the Alpine Club for its refusal to support Crawford's protest.|$|E
25|$|Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts {{who pass}} through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the {{original}} film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they look for answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and <b>too</b> <b>little</b> screen <b>time</b> for the apes who made the series famous.

50|$|Prediction bias in case {{duration}} {{are expressed}} as estimates per 8 hr of OR time. Prediction error equals the actual {{duration of the}} new case minus the estimated duration of the new case. Bias indicates whether the estimate is consistently too high or consistently too low, and precision reflects the magnitudes of the errors of the estimates. Efficient OR suites should aim to have bias in case duration estimates per 8 hr of OR time that is less than 15 minutes. A reason for bias can be surgeons’ consistently shortening their case duration estimates because they have <b>too</b> <b>little</b> OR <b>time</b> allocated and need to “fit” their list of cases into the OR time they do have. In contrast, other OR suites may have surgeons that purposely overestimate case durations to keep control/access of their allocated OR time so that if a new case appears their OR time was not given away.|$|R
40|$|Stress-related {{disorder}} is increasing among children and adolescents, especially among girls. Aim: The {{purpose of this}} study was to describe young people's daily activities in relation tostress. Method: The result is based on twelve studies that described everyday activities and itsimpact on stress in adolescents 9 - 17 years old. Results: Sleep is a factor for stress-relatedillness and the results show that young people sleep much less than recommended. Manyyoung people feel that they have <b>too</b> <b>little</b> leisure <b>time</b> and difficult to keep up with everythingthat is expected of them. School-based stress is common and many adolescents experienceboth high demands on school assignments and lack of time. Girls generally put more time onstudies and household tasks than boys and sets higher demands on themselves. Leisure isimportant for mental well-being and choice of leisure activities vary depending on gender andage. Conclusion: When planning interventions for young people's health it’s important toreview all aspects of life and to target interventions to those that need it most. Anoccupational therapeutic focus on the activity balance and meaningful activities provide aunique opportunity to contribute to better health for young people.
