40|$|Abstract. Here {{we present}} stable isotope data from three {{sediment}} records from lakes that lie along the Macedonian- Albanian border (Lake Prespa: 1 core, and Lake Ohrid: 2 cores). The records only overlap {{for the last}} 40 kyr, although the longest record contains the MIS 5 / 6 <b>transition</b> (<b>Lake</b> Ohrid). The sedimentary characteristics of both lakes differ significantly between the glacial and interglacial phases. At the end of MIS 6 Lake Ohrid’s water level was low (high � 18 Ocalcite) and, although productivity was increasing (high calcite content), the carbon supply was mainly from inorganic catchment rock sources (high � 13 Ccarb). During the last interglacial, calcite and TOC production and preservation increased, progressively lower � 18 Ocalcite suggest increase in humidity and lake levels until around 115 ka. During ca. 80 ka to 11 ka the lake records suggest cold conditions as indicated by negligible calcite precipitation and low organic matter content. In Lake Ohrid, � 13 Corg are complacent; in contrast, Lake Prespa shows consistently higher � 13 Corg suggesting a low oxidation of 13 C-depleted organic matter in agreement with a general deterioration of climate conditions during the glacial. From 15 ka to {{the onset of the}} Holocene, calcite and TOC begin to increase, suggesting lake levels were probably low (high � 18 Ocalcite). In the Holocene (11 ka to present) enhanced productivity is manifested by high calcite and organic matter content. All three cores show an early Holocene characterised by low � 18 Ocalcite, apart from the very early Holocene phase in Prespa where the lowest � 18 Ocalcite occurs at ca. 7. 5 ka, suggesting a phase of higher lake level only in (the more sensitive) Lake Prespa. From 6 ka, � 18 Ocalcite suggest progressive aridification, in agreement with many other records in the Mediterranean, although the uppermost sediments in one core records low � 18 Ocalcite which we interpret as a result of human activity. Overall, the isotope data present here confirm that these two big lakes have captured the large scale, low frequency palaeoclimate variation that is seen in Mediterranean lakes, although in detail there is much palaeoclimate information that could be gained, especially small scale, high frequency differences between this region and the Mediterranean...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{solutions}} are obtained for several sedimentary problems featuring semi-infinite alluvial channels evolving under diffusional sediment transport. Moving boundaries are considered {{at one end}} of the channels, and represent transitions between alluvial reaches and either bedrock-floored channels or bodies of standing water. Three elementary cases are considered: bedrock-alluvial <b>transitions,</b> <b>lake</b> breaches, and prograding deltas. It is shown that idealized formulations of all three problems share the same mathematical structure and admit exact similarity solutions. Elementary solutions can further be assembled to describe composite profiles. This is illustrated by the case of a natural lake undergoing simultaneous breaching and backfill. For both elementary and composite cases, the explicit solutions clarify the link between alluvial profile evolution and the migration of channel boundaries. For the case of lake breaching, for instance, the outlet channel profile is controlled simultaneously by downwards incision and upstream migration of the channel head. The pace of the resulting water-level drawdown in turn affects the form of the backfill deposits upstream of the lake...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess how best to manage {{impacted}} lake systems, one needs to understand the trophic functioning of the lake system and the recent states through which the <b>lake</b> may have <b>transitioned.</b> <b>Lakes</b> {{in the middle and}} lower reaches of the Yangtze have been heavily impacted over recent decades. In order to understand recent changes in functional status, we examined sediment cores covering the last 120 years from two lakes in the same catchment with differing status: one algal-dominated (Taibai Lake) and the other macrophyte-dominated (Longgan Lake). Chironomid head capsules were identified from both sites and an expanded chironomid-total phosphorus (TP) transfer function (21 sites were added to the 30 -lake model previously developed by Zhang et al. 2006) was used to assess the lakes’ response to recent anthropogenic change. Quantitative chironomid-inferred TP (CI-TP) reconstructions showed that Taibai Lake experienced clear changes in trophic status since the 1860 s. Before the 1950 s, the CI-TP concentration was relatively stable around 50 – 80 lg L- 1, while it reached to 80 – 130 lg L- 1 in the latter period. CI-TP for Longgan Lake, however, showed a relative decline from the range of 50 – 75 lg L- 1 since the 1880 s to 30 – 40 lg L- 1 in recent years, accompanied by strong evidence from the chironomids for increased macrophyte biomass as TP levels declined. Both reconstructions agreed with diatom inferences of TP from the same lakes. The stark difference between these two sites is thought to reflect a function of macrophyte development, with Taibai Lake losing its plants through increased nutrient levels and internal recycling, whereas Longgan Lake, which is much bigger in area and hence potentially more resilient to change, was able to develop macrophyte communities over the same time period. The positive feedbacks associated with abundant macrophytes retained the clear water state of Longgan Lake, but a further increase in nutrients might lead to decrease in resilience of the relatively stable macrophyte state and loss of benthic pathways of primary production, which would push the lake towards eutrophication. Unless nutrient inputs to Longgan are controlled, Longgan Lake might lose macrophyte communities and follow a developmental pathway similar to that observed in Taibai Lake...|$|R

40|$|Paleolimnological {{techniques}} can reveal long-term perturbations and associated stable state <b>transitions</b> of <b>lake</b> ecosystems. However, such transitions {{are difficult to}} predict since changes to lake ecosystems can be abrupt or gradual. This study examined whether there were past transitions in the ecological regime of Kings Billabong, a shallow River Murray wetland in southeast Australia. A 94 -cm-long core, covering c. 90 years of age, was analysed at 1 cm resolution for subfossil cladocerans, diatoms and other proxies. Prior to river regulation (c. 1930), the littoral to planktonic ratios of cladocerans and diatoms, and bulk sediment δ 13 C values were high, while the period from c. 1930 to c. 1970 experienced considerable changes to the wetland ecosystem. The abrupt nature of changes of planktonic cladocerans and diatoms, particularly after the onset of river regulation (1930 s), was triggered by inundation, high rates of sedimentation and shifts in bulk sediment δ 15 N values. However, the transition of a once littoral-dominated community, to one favouring an increasingly turbid, plankton-dominated trophic condition following river regulation was relatively slow and lasted for decades. The progression to a new regime was likely delayed by the partial recovery of submerged plant communities and related internal dynamics. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|R

Combined sediment microfacies analyses and high-resolution micro-X-ray fluorescence element scanning allow us to identify 157 detrital event layers deposited in spring-summer and to discriminate between regional flood and local debris flow deposits. Higher spring-summer flood activity with a mean event recurrence of 3 - 5 yr occurred in several well-confined multidecadal episodes during the Dark Ages Cold Period and Medieval time (A.

Palynological and plant macrofossil studies of a Late-Wurm deposit in the littoral are presented. The stratigra-phy of the sediments is from bottom to top: sand, sandy clay, clay, lake marl, peat. The Oldest Dryas consists of three local pollen assemblage zones recording the gradual establishment of a treeless vegetation rich in heliophilous and pioneer species and also containing dwarf shrubs in its third phase. At the transition from clay to lake marl a sharp Juniperus peak initiates the Balling which is mainly dominated by tree-bir'ches.

Fishes with similarly enriched δ 13 C were used to identify bentho-pelagic and littoral trophic pathways. River and Lake Superior organic matter (OM) sources contributed to both pathways. Differences between the δ 13 C in fishes and invertebrate prey revealed that fish production was supported at multiple spatial scales.

A {{better understanding of}} past periods indicative of permafrost degradation and aggradation is important for predicting the future response of Arctic landscapes to climate change. Here, we used a multi-proxy approach to analyse a ~ 4 m long sediment core from a drained thermokarst lake basin on the northern Seward Peninsula in western Arctic Alaska (USA). Sedimentological, biogeochemical, geochronological, micropalaeontological (ostracoda, testate amoebae) and tephra analyses {{were used to determine}} the long-term environmental Early-Wisconsin to Holocene history preserved in our core for central Beringia. Yedoma accumulation dominated throughout the Early to Late-Wisconsin but was interrupted by wetland formation from 44. 5 to 41. 5 ka BP. The latter was terminated by the deposition of 1 m of volcanic tephra, most likely originating from the South Killeak Maar eruption at about 42 ka BP. Yedoma deposition continued until 22. 5 ka BP and was followed by a depositional hiatus in the sediment core between 22. 5 and 0. 23 ka BP. We interpret this hiatus as due to intense thermokarst activity in the areas surrounding the site, which served as a sediment source during the Late-Wisconsin to Holocene climate <b>transition.</b> The <b>lake</b> forming the modern basin on the upland initiated around 0. 23 ka BP and drained catastrophically in spring 2005. The present study emphasises that Arctic lake systems and periglacial landscapes are highly dynamic and that permafrost formation as well as degradation in central Beringia was controlled by regional to global climate patterns as well as by local disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim: A {{series of}} dams along {{the course of}} a river forms a complex {{cascading}} reservoir system. The interconnectivity of the dams is perceived with the reduction of turbidity and phosphorus and the increase of specific richness throughout the system. Designing a management system that promotes the integration of biotic and abiotic data is essential to these resources of recognized importance for the population, the country's power generation and watersheds management. The Jacuí River is an important water resource in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, along its upper course, five water reservoirs comprise a cascade system tapped for energy generation and agriculture, but the effects on the phytoplankton community of cascading dams are still unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton associated with climatological and limnological characteristics of the Ernestina and Itaúba water reservoirs, located in the upper Jacuí River, RS, Brazil. Methods Sampling campaigns were carried out seasonally from January 2012 to February 2013, with four sampling stations within each dam and at three different depths. The sampling units were determined according to the three zones of the reservoir: river areas, <b>transition</b> and <b>lake.</b> Results: A total of 91 phytoplankton species were identified in Ernestina and 130 in Itaúba. There {{was no significant difference between}} vertical and horizontal patterns, since the community responded to seasonal changes and the specific characteristics of each dam. Conclusions The specific richness and water transparency increased downstream of the system and changes in water retention time were important for cell density and composition...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the panarchy and interactions since the last interglacial period in the oldest, most diverse and hydrologically connected European lake system, we assess changes in the diatom record and selected geochemistry data from Lake Ohrid's "DEEP site" core and compare it with the diatom and multi-proxy data from Lake Prespa core Co 1215. Driven by climate forcing, tephra impact and/or human influence, the lakes experienced two adaptive cycles during the last 92 ka: "interglacial and interstadial-regime" and "glacial-regime". The patterns of regime shifts appear synchronous in both lakes, while differences occur in the inferred amplitudes of the variations. The deeper Lake Ohrid shifted between ultraoligo- and oligotrophic regimes in contrast to the more shallow Lake Prespa, which shifts from (oligo-) mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions. In response to external forcing, Lake Ohrid exhibits a high capacity to buffer disturbances, whereas Lake Prespa is much more resilient and "recovers" in relatively short time. This decoupling of the response is evident during the MIS 5 / 4 and 2 / 1 <b>transitions,</b> when <b>Lake</b> Ohrid displays prolonged and gradual changes. The lakes' specific differences in the response and feedback mechanisms and their different physical and chemical properties, probably confine a direct influence of Lake Prespa's shallow/eutrophic regimes over the productivity regimes of Lake Ohrid. Regime shifts of Lake Ohrid due to the hydrological connectivity with Lake Prespa are not evident in the data presented here. Moreover, complete ecological collapse did not happened in both lakes for the period presented in the study...|$|R
40|$|The <b>transition</b> of shallow <b>lake</b> {{ecosystems}} {{between the}} clear-water, macrophyte-dominated {{state and the}} turbid state dominated by phytoplankton depends on both physico-chemical and biological factors. In this study, the impact {{of some of these}} interactions on the stability of the macrophyte-dominated state of a lake are studied by means of the integrated eutrophication model PCLake. The model describes phytoplankton, macrophytes and a simplified food web, within the framework of closed nutrient cycles. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of herbivory by birds and fish on the transition from clear to turbid state, including the influence of variability in other biological parameters. The model was applied to the data of a small, biomanipulated lake, dominated by macrophytes, showing signs of a transition back to the turbid state. Simulations were carried out for the lake as well as for an experimental situation where herbivory was impeded. A parameter variation study was performed for 10 parameters, affecting the zooplankton, fish and macrophytes behaviour, to determine the sensitivities and the model uncertainty. The model reproduced adequately the <b>transition</b> of the <b>lake</b> from phytoplankton dominance before the biomanipulation, via dominance of rooted perennial plants in the first years after it, to a state characterized by turion-forming plants in early summer and phytoplankton in autumn. It is shown that the probability of the transition back to phytoplankton dominance is mainly enhanced by herbivory by birds. This caused a shift towards inedible plant species with a shorter natural growing season, allowing the return of a phytoplankton bloom in autumn. If herbivory was impeded, this shift did not occur and phytoplankton remained low due to nitrogen limitation. The model results were quite sensitive to the zooplankton filtering rate and, in the presence of herbivory only, to the macrophytes growth parameters. The impact of the fish parameters showed to be less important. The model may be used to evaluate the relative importance of different assumptions or factors in the success of biomanipulation measures in lakes.

40|$|AbstractThis note {{describes}} extended {{monitoring of}} two small headwater lakes in the Lockhart River in the Northwest Territories (Canada) during consecutive late {{winter and spring}} transitions. During these <b>transitions,</b> the <b>lakes</b> changed from isolated ice-bound water bodies to interconnected lakes, throughout which they exhibited similar modifications to their physico-chemical characteristics. Lake temperature changes were linked to ambient conditions, with warming after May 1 initiating snow- and ice melt inflows. Lake temperatures of 3 °C to 4 °C were measured in both lakes {{at the start of}} monitoring, which were maintained until a steady increase commenced in early June 1 as ice cover started to recede. This period was also associated with peak water levels and lake discharges. Conductivity decreases (~ 26 to ~ 12 μS/cm in the larger, shallower lake, Area 8, to 16 to 11 μS/cm in the smaller, deeper lake, Lake I 1) commenced around mid-May, in advance of lake temperatures increases, and stabilized after approximately 3 weeks once lake ice had melted. The extent of lake dilution based on conductivity decreases (54 – 56 % in Area 8, and 31 % in Lake I 1) was attributed primarily to the ice cover melt volume on each lake at the start of monitoring. DO concentrations were mostly undersaturated {{at the start of the}} monitoring period, with values below aquatic life guidelines; Area 8 reached saturation once lake conductivity stabilized, but Lake I 1 was saturated once conductivity started to decrease. pH transitioned from slightly acidic (~ 5. 8; below aquatic life guidelines) to circumneutral, with the transition slightly different between lakes depending on the <b>lake</b> conductivity <b>transition...</b>|$|R
