60|$|When {{consciousness}} returned, and, as I soon learned, I {{was down}} but a moment, I sprang quickly {{to my feet}} searching for my sword, and there I found it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stone dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom. As I regained my full senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but only through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> chest and coming out below the shoulder. As I had lunged I had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles, inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.|$|E
60|$|Entirely {{outfitted}} I {{would not}} have known myself, so strange was my garb and my armament. Upon my back were slung my bow, arrows, shield, and short spear; from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girdle depended my knife; at my right hip was my stone hatchet; and at my left hung the coils of my long rope. By reaching my right hand over my left shoulder, I could seize the spear or arrows; my left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder, while a veritable contortionist-act was necessary to place my shield {{in front of me}} and upon my left arm. The shield, long and oval, is utilized more as back-armor than as a defense against frontal attack, for the close-set armlets of gold upon the left forearm are principally depended upon to ward off knife, spear, hatchet, or arrow from in front; but against the greater carnivora and the attacks of several human antagonists, the shield is utilized to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the left arm.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} {{territory of}} Champa roughly equals the South Central Coast region, {{although it has}} at times extended well into the North Central Coast and its influence also extended into the Central Highlands. Except for its first capital, all <b>of</b> Champa's political <b>centers</b> were located in the South Central Coast. Some of the earlier capitals, as well as <b>the</b> religious <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> Sơn and <b>the</b> port city of Hội An were located in the territory of present-day Quảng Nam Province. Probably due to defeats in wars against Đại Việt <b>the</b> political <b>center</b> shifted further south to Vijaya {{in what is now}} Bình Định Province. After the fall of Vijaya to Vietnam in 1471, Champa had to retreat to the southern principality of Panduranga (now at Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận Province), while much of occupied Champa continued to exist as a sort of protectorate within Vietnam for some time.|$|R

40|$|The main theme <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{thesis is}} {{institution}} of extraordinary punishment {{and the way}} how it is comprehended by Czech law. While imprisonment for life can be imposed in almost all European countries and this punishment isn't systematicaly excluded from criminal codes, the Czech conception is different. Czech law not only states which crimes are punishable by imprisonment for life but also that said crimes must fulfil legal conditions which characterize offender's motivations, means of execution and consequences of said criminal offence. These legal conditions, {{that are part of}} czech law since 1961, are in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> thesis {{in spite of the fact}} that in the past it was embodied by death penalty which is unallowable for today's standarts. Other possibilities of imposing imprisonment for longer period than legally determined are also mentioned together with the strictest ways of criminal law punishments of legal persons or persons that are less than 18 years old. Other aims of this thesis are exploring of extraordinary punishment history (in terms of both death penalty and imprisonment) and comparation with current legal order. Domestic legal adaptation is evaluated from international and constitutional point of view, since life imprisonment can be rated as inadmissible by European [...] ...|$|R
