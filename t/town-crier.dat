2500|$|After {{moving into}} the Gulf of Mexico, {{conditions}} became favorable for additional intensification, with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Dolly strengthened steadily beginning on July21, and by the afternoon of July22, it strengthened into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At this point, the storm was located about 165mi (265km) east-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. Steady strengthening continued that evening and into the morning of July23, at which point Dolly reached Category2 intensity while {{just east of the}} Rio Grande Valley at 10:00 that morning with winds of up to 100mph (160km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 963mbar. At 1:00pmCDT (1800UTC) that same day, Dolly made landfall on South Padre Island, Texas, slightly weaker as a Category 1 hurricane with 85mph (140km/h) sustained winds and a pressure of 967mbar. Hurricane Dolly then moved west-northwestward over the Laguna Madre crossing onto the mainland near the Cameron-Willacy County line. [...] South Padre Island, Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, Los Fresnos, Bayview, Brownsville, San Benito, Rio Hondo, Arroyo City and especially Harlingen suffered heavy wind and flooding. [...] Hurricane Dolly then thrashed the Delta Region along and north of Highway 107 with its most fierce winds and rain. Towns like Santa Rosa, La Villa, Edcouch, Elsa, Monte Alto and San Carlos were hit hard by the slow-moving, wet hurricane which dumped 10-20inch rains. [...] According to Mid Valley <b>Town-Crier</b> newspaper, the Weslaco Airport clocked gusts of 68knots (78mph). [...] Dolly weakened to a tropical storm after passing US 281 (west of San Manuel and Linn, Texas) late on the 23rd, and then a tropical depression, as it moved slowly inland into Mexico. The circulation weakened into a remnant low over northern Mexico on the afternoon of July25, then crossed back into the United States, passing through the Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua/El Paso, Texas metropolitan area on the morning of July26 and then north across New Mexico. The remnant low of Dolly finally began to dissipate late in the evening of July27 approximately [...] west-northwest of Dalhart, Texas.|$|E
60|$|Stop, stop, <b>town-crier!</b> The lost is found.--Oh, my pretty Annie, {{we forgot}} to tell your mother of our ramble, and she is in despair and has sent the <b>town-crier</b> to bellow {{up and down the}} streets, affrighting old and young, for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand? Well, let us hasten homeward; and as we go forget not to thank Heaven, my Annie, that after {{wandering}} a little way into the world you may return at the first summons with an untainted and unwearied heart, and be a happy child again. But I have gone too far astray for the <b>town-crier</b> to call me back.|$|E

60|$|The night {{watchman}} {{had replaced the}} <b>town-crier.</b> All was quiet within the city walls: the inhabitants could sleep in peace, a beneficent government was wakeful and guarding their rest.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} the voice of Auguste Moleux, the <b>town-crier</b> of Boulogne, who, bell in hand, was trudging his way along the Rue Daumont, closely {{followed}} by two fellows of the municipal guard.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{at a given}} hour--seven o'clock had Auguste Moleux, the <b>town-crier,</b> understood--the boom of the cannon would be heard, {{the gates of the}} town would be opened, the harbour would become a free port.|$|E
60|$|A woman--a stranger--had {{been arrested}} and imprisoned in the Fort Gayole and the <b>town-crier</b> {{publicly}} proclaimed that if she escaped from jail, one member of every family in the town--rich or poor, republican or royalist, Catholic or free-thinker--would be summarily guillotined.|$|E
60|$|Fame! Some very humble {{persons in}} a town {{may be said to}} possess it,--as, the penny-post, the <b>town-crier,</b> the constable,--and they are known to everybody; while many richer, more intellectual, worthier persons are unknown by the {{majority}} of their fellow-citizens. Something analogous in the world at large.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} a ship can come {{near enough to}} make herself heard," [...] {{returned}} the other, [...] "though the second lieutenant of that ship never uses a trumpet in the heaviest weather, they tell me, sir. Our gents say {{his father was a}} <b>town-crier,</b> and that he has inherited the family estate." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{very popular}} local {{excursion}} by steamboat to Lulstead Cove was announced {{through the streets}} of Budmouth one Thursday morning by the weak-voiced <b>town-crier,</b> to start at six o'clock the same day. The weather was lovely, and the opportunity being the first of the kind offered to them, Owen and Cytherea went with the rest.|$|E
60|$|The <b>town-crier</b> {{had evidently}} ceased {{to read the}} proclamation. One by one {{the windows in the}} public square were lighted up from within. The {{citizens}} of Boulogne wanted to think over the strange events which had occurred without their knowledge, yet which were apparently to have such direful or such joyous consequences for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I make {{no secret}} of it. I do not talk about my private affairs. I do not send a <b>town-crier</b> to Charing Cross to tell the passers-by that I am in trouble. But I care not whether men know or not that I am unfitted for joining in such festivities. My {{presence}} is not wanted for their marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin had {{undoubtedly}} for {{the moment}} lost his presence of mind. He did not even think of calling to his picked guard, so completely taken aback was he by this unforeseen move {{on the part of}} Sir Percy. Yet, obviously, he should have been ready for this eventuality. Had he not caused the <b>town-crier</b> to loudly proclaim throughout the city that if ONE female prisoner escaped from Fort Gayole the entire able-bodied population of Boulogne would suffer? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{he raises}} his clear loud voice above all {{the din of the}} town. It drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues and draws each man's mind from his own business; it rolls up and down the echoing street, and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick, and penetrates {{downward}} to the cellar kitchen where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen. Who of all that address the public ear, whether in church or court-house or hall of state, has such an attentive audience as the <b>town-crier!</b> What saith the people's orator? ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘How shall I tell Jack?’ said Edwin, ruminating. If he {{had been}} less {{occupied}} with the thought, he must have seen her singular emotion. ‘I never thought of Jack. It must be broken to him, before the <b>town-crier</b> knows it. I dine with the dear fellow to-morrow and next day—Christmas Eve and Christmas Day—but it would never do to spoil his feast-days. He always worries about me, and moddley-coddleys in the merest trifles. The news is sure to overset him. How on earth shall this be broken to Jack?’ ...|$|E
60|$|Lo! the <b>town-crier</b> again, {{with some}} new secret for the public ear. Will he tell us of an auction, or of a lost pocket-book or a show of {{beautiful}} wax figures, or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan? I guess the latter. See how he uplifts the bell {{in his right hand}} and shakes it slowly at first, then with a hurried motion, till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once, and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession far and near.|$|E
60|$|The Coppersmith is a bird {{who makes}} a noise exactly like the beating of a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it is {{because he is the}} <b>town-crier</b> to every Indian garden, and tells all the news to {{everybody}} who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the path, he heard his 'attention' notes like a tiny dinner-gong; and then the steady 'Ding-dong-lock! Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead! Ding-dong-tock!' That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the frogs croaking; for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little birds.|$|E
60|$|To this gloomy numbing of {{the senses}} had succeeded the {{inevitable}} morbid restlessness: the pacing {{up and down the}} narrow room, the furtive glances at the clock, the frequent orders to Frédérick to go out and see if M. Martin-Roget was not yet home. For Frédérick had come back after his first errand with the astounding news that M. Martin-Roget had left his lodgings the previous day at about four o'clock, and had not been seen or heard of since. In fact his landlady was very anxious about him and was sorely tempted to see the <b>town-crier</b> on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "No fear, no fear, Captain," [...] {{returned}} the stubborn {{conductor of the}} ship, who, as his authority was so brief, was only the more jealous of its unrestrained exercise, and who, like an usurper of the throne, felt a jealousy of the more legitimate power which he had temporarily dispossessed; [...] "no fear of me, Captain. I have trolled over this ground oftener than you have crossed the ocean, and I {{know the name of}} every rock on the bottom, as well as the <b>town-crier</b> knows the streets of Newport. Let her luff, boy; luff her into the very eye of the wind; luff, you can"---- ...|$|E
6000|$|As far as {{the boys}} knew, the civic affairs of the place were transacted entirely by two constables. Of mayors and magistrates, such as there must have been, they knew nothing, and they had not the least notion what the Whigs whom they were always trying to elect were {{to do when they}} got into office. They knew that the constables were both Democrats, but, if they thought at all about the fact, they thought their Democracy the natural outcome of their dark constabulary nature, and by no means {{imagined}} that they were constables because they were Democrats. The worse of the two, or the more merciless, was also the <b>town-crier,</b> whose office is now not anywhere known in America, I believe; though I heard a <b>town-crier</b> in a Swiss village not many years ago. In the Boy's Town the crier carried a good-sized bell; when he started out he rang it till he reached the street corner, and then he stopped, and began some such proclamation as, [...] "O, yes! O, yes! O, yes! There will be an auction this evening at early candle-light, at Brown & Robinson's store! Dry goods, boots and shoes, hats and caps, hardware, queen's ware, and so forth, and so forth. Richard Roe, Auctioneer! Come one, come all, come everybody!" [...] Then the crier rang his bell, and went on to the next corner, where he repeated his proclamation. After a while, the constable got a deputy to whom he made over his business of <b>town-crier.</b> This deputy was no other than that reckless boy who used to run out from the printing-office and shoot the turtle-doves; and he decorated his proclamation with quips and quirks of his own invention, and with personal allusions to his employer, who was auctioneer as well as constable. But though he was hail-fellow with every boy in town, and although every boy rejoiced in his impudence, he was so panoplied in the awfulness of his relation to the constabulary functions that, however remote it was, no boy would have thought of trifling with him when he was on duty. If ever a boy holloed something at him when he was out with his crier's bell, he turned and ran as hard as he could, and as if from the constable himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Committee of Public Safety," [...] he resumed, [...] "would {{look upon}} this {{city as a}} nest of traitors if {{on the day that}} the Scarlet Pimpernel becomes our {{prisoner}} Lady Blakeney herself, the wife of that notorious English spy, had already quitted Boulogne. The whole town knows by now that you are in our hands--you, the most precious hostage we can hold for the ultimate capture of the man whom we all fear and detest. Virtually the <b>town-crier</b> is at the present moment proclaiming to the inhabitants of this city: 'We want that man, but we already have his wife, see to it, citizens, that she does not escape! for if she do, we shall summarily shoot the breadwinner in every family in the town!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{think of}} my winning," [...] said Lady Julia, drawing {{together}} her wealth. [...] "Well, I'm sure I want it bad enough, for I don't at all know whether I've got any income of my own. It's all John Eames' fault, my dear, for he won't go and make those people settle it in Lincoln's Inn Fields." [...] Poor Lily, who {{was standing on the}} hearth-rug, touched her mother's arm. She knew that Johnny's name was lugged in with reference to Lady Julia's money altogether for her benefit. [...] "I wonder whether she ever had a Johnny of her own," [...] she said to her mother, [...] "and, if so, whether she liked it when her friends sent the <b>town-crier</b> round to talk about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There spoke all Fairport in one voice!" [...] exclaimed Oldbuck [...] "it is {{the very}} spirit of the borough has {{infected}} us all; I think I have smelled the smoke these two days, that the wind has stuck, like a remora, in the north-east--and its prejudices fly farther than its vapours. Believe me, my dear Hector, were I to walk up the High Street of Fairport, displaying this inestimable gem {{in the eyes of}} each one I met, no human creature, from the provost to the <b>town-crier,</b> would stop to ask me its history. But if I carried a bale of linen cloth under my arm, I could not penetrate to the Horsemarket ere I should be overwhelmed with queries about its precise texture and price. Oh, one might parody their brutal ignorance in the words of Gray: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A very {{sensible}} way, lad. You will understand, of course, that I {{know enough}} of Jeremiah {{to be quite}} sure {{that he would not}} relinquish a fine property if he had a leg to stand upon. However, that is no business of mine, and I have no doubt that {{the fact that he is}} going to be your father-in-law, has had no small influence in bringing about this very admirable arrangement. Of course the matter will make a good deal of talk, but these things soon die out, and the county will welcome you back too heartily to care how your return has been brought about. You can rely upon my action in the part of <b>town-crier,</b> and I am sure to some of my patients the flutter of excitement the news will occasion will do a great deal more good than any medicine I could give them. Of course you are going to stay here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell {{him when}} you come back from Plymouth, and hold your peace till that's done. No good can come of lawyers in such a matter as this. You might as well tell the <b>town-crier.</b> Why should he want to put bread out of his own mouth? And if there is a chance of hard words being said, why should he hear them? He'll work for his money, no doubt; but what odds is it to him whether your lady is to be called Mrs. Caldigate or Miss Bolton? He won't have to go to prison. His boy won't be!--you know what.' This was terrible, but yet it was all so true! 'I'll tell you what it is, squire. We can't make it lighter by talking about it all round. I used to do a bit of hunting once; and I never knew any good come of asking what there was {{the other side of the}} fence. You've got to have it, or you've got to leave it alone. That's just where you are. Of course it isn't nice.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{if she had}} {{not thought}} of it all before! As if there was {{anything}} new in this counsel which Mrs. Thorne had given her! She had received the same advice from her mother, from her sister, from her uncle, and from Lady Julia, till she was sick of it. How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle? Any other girl would receive advice on such a subject from her mother alone, and there the secret would rest. But her secret had been published, as it were, by the <b>town-crier</b> in the High Street! Everybody knew that she had been jilted by Adolphus Crosbie, and that it was intended that she should be consoled by John Eames. And people seemed to think that they had a right to rebuke her if she expressed an unwillingness to carry out this intention which the public had so kindly arranged for her.|$|E
60|$|Here we see {{something}} {{to remind us}} of the <b>town-crier</b> and his ding-dong-bell. Look! look at that great cloth spread out in the air, pictured all over with wild beasts, as if they had met together to choose a king, according to their custom in the days of Æsop. But they are choosing neither a king nor a President, else we should hear a most horrible snarling! They have come from the deep woods and the wild mountains and the desert sands and the polar snows only to do homage to my little Annie. As we enter among them the great elephant makes us a bow in the best style of elephantine courtesy, bending lowly down his mountain bulk, with trunk abased and leg thrust out behind. Annie returns the salute, much to the gratification of the elephant, who is certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan. The lion and the lioness are busy with two beef-bones. The royal tiger, the beautiful, the untamable, keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step, unmindful of the spectators or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life, when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals from the jungles of Bengal.|$|E
60|$|Both ends of {{the line}} are exposed; the lower end {{terminating}} in an eye-splice or loop {{coming up from the}} bottom {{against the side of the}} tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no <b>town-crier</b> would ever find her again.|$|E
60|$|The <b>town-crier</b> has rung his bell at {{a distant}} corner, and little Annie stands on her father's doorsteps trying {{to hear what}} the man with the loud voice is talking about. Let me listen too. Oh, he is telling the people that an {{elephant}} and a lion and a royal tiger and a horse with horns, and other strange beasts from foreign countries, have come to town and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them. Perhaps little Annie would like to go? Yes, and I can see that the pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street with the green trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine and the pavements and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them with her broom. She feels that impulse to go strolling away--that longing after the mystery of the great world--which many children feel, and which I felt in my childhood. Little Annie shall take a ramble with me. See! I do but hold out my hand, and like some bright bird in the sunny air, with her blue silk frock fluttering upward from her white pantalets, she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street.|$|E
60|$|We {{should like}} to go through {{every one of these}} prints. There is the jolly miller, who, {{returning}} home at night, calls upon his wife to get him a supper, and falls to upon rashers of bacon and ale. How he gormandizes, that jolly miller! rasher after rasher, how they pass away frizzling and, smoking from the gridiron down that immense grinning gulf of a mouth. Poor wife! how she pines and frets, at that untimely hour of midnight to be obliged to fry, fry, fry perpetually, and minister to the monster's appetite. And yonder in the clock: what agonized face is that we see? By heavens, it is the squire of the parish. What business has he there? Let us not ask. Suffice it to say, that he has, in the hurry of the moment, left up stairs his br----; his--psha! a part of his dress, in short, with a number of bank-notes in the pockets. Look in the next page, and you will see the ferocious, bacon-devouring ruffian of a miller is actually causing this garment to be carried through the village and cried by the <b>town-crier.</b> And we blush to be obliged to say that the demoralized miller never offered to return the banknotes, although he was so mighty scrupulous in endeavoring to find an owner for the corduroy portfolio in which he had found them.|$|E
6000|$|These worthies were, indeed, nearly {{concerned}} in the fracas {{which their}} laziness occasioned, being no {{other than the}} faithful Mr. Fairservice, with his friend Mr. Hammorgaw, and another person, whom I afterwards {{found to be the}} <b>town-crier,</b> who were sitting over a cog of ale, as they called it (at my expense, as my bill afterwards informed me), in order to devise the terms and style of a proclamation to be made through the streets the next day, in order that [...] "the unfortunate young gentleman," [...] as they had the impudence to qualify me, might be restored to his friends without farther delay. It may be supposed that I did not suppress my displeasure at this impertinent interference with my affairs; but Andrew set up such ejaculations of transport at my arrival, as fairly drowned my expressions of resentment. His raptures, perchance, were partly political; and the tears of joy which he shed had certainly their source in that noble fountain of emotion, the tankard. However, the tumultuous glee which he felt, or pretended to feel, at my return, saved Andrew the broken head which I had twice destined him;--first, on account of the colloquy he had held with the precentor on my affairs; and secondly, for the impertinent history he had thought proper to give of me to Mr. Jarvie. I however contented myself with slapping the door of my bedroom in his face as he followed me, praising Heaven for my safe return, and mixing his joy with admonitions to me to take care how I walked my own ways in future. I then went to bed, resolving my first business in the morning should be to discharge this troublesome, pedantic, self-conceited coxcomb, who seemed so much disposed to constitute himself rather a preceptor than a domestic.|$|E
