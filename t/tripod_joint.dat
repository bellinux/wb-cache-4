50|$|These joints {{are used}} at the inboard end of car driveshafts. The joints were {{developed}} by Michel Orain, of Glaenzer Spicer of Poissy, France. This joint has a three-pointed yoke attached to the shaft, which has barrel-shaped roller bearings on the ends. These fit into a cup with three matching grooves, attached to the differential. Since there is only significant movement in one axis, this simple arrangement works well. These also allow an axial 'plunge' movement of the shaft, so that engine rocking and other effects do not preload the bearings. A typical <b>Tripod</b> <b>joint</b> has up to 50 mm of plunge travel, and 26 degrees of angular articulation. The <b>tripod</b> <b>joint</b> does not have as much angular range {{as many of the}} other joint types, but tends to be lower in cost and more efficient. Due to this it is typically used in rear wheel drive vehicle configurations or on the inboard side of front wheel drive vehicles where the required range of motion is lower.|$|E
40|$|Article history: This study aims to {{understand}} the applied forces and related vibrational characteristics of a <b>tripod</b> <b>joint</b> (TJ), which is mostly used in front-drive-type middle-sized sedans in South Korea. The plunging force (PF) and generated axial force (GAF) are the most influential quantities related to the vibrational characteristics of a driveshaft. To obtain meaningful data, specially designed tests were performed usingMTS test sets. The results of direct measurements reveal that higher PF and GAF values appear to worsen the vibrational characteristics of the vehicle. On the other hand, the measured apparent mass is useful for calculating the applied forces for a short driveshaft that has no dynamic vibration absorber. Among diversely controlled samples, it shows thatthe viscosity and tight fit {{are very sensitive to}} shudder vibrations of the vehicle. Therefore, these are good design factors for quality control...|$|E
40|$|An {{automotive}} {{drive shaft}} {{is used in}} a front drive transmission vehicle for transmitting rotary movement from the gearbox output shaft to the wheels with a constant velocity. This paper presents the kinematic model of ball joint and <b>tripod</b> <b>joint</b> with consideration of clearance and proposes a simplified dynamics model of the drive shaft. The simulation of the dynamics model is given by the measured data. Also, the abrasive wear of the ball type joint is tested on the experimental setup with consideration of full loading. The {{results show that the}} dynamics of the motion will be affected by the clearance when the loading changes its direction. The motion will be stable due to the damping. It can be found that the abrasive wear of ball joint largely depends on the relative sliding velocity from the experiments. This will probably affectthe dynamics performance and the impact force, which will also cause the other type of failures...|$|E

Grind-hardening is an alternative process {{that can be used}} for the simultaneous surface hardening and grinding of metallic components. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment methods are used for the environmental analysis of the grind-hardening process. The environmental impact of the grindhardening process is compared with the respective impact caused by conventional {{heat treatment}} methods in two different pilot cases: the production of raceways and the production of <b>tripod</b> <b>joints.</b> The analysis indicates that the utilization of grind-hardening decreases significantly the environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|Constant {{velocity}} (CV) joints {{have been}} widely used for modern vehicles. The sealed grease of CV joints must pro-vide low friction and wear protection for the lifetime use of the vehicle. Grease performance affects the vibration and noise level in the vehicle. Vehicles that have traveled long distances may suffer mechanical and thermal overloads, thus causing the grease to degrade due to changes in its physical and chemical properties. In this article, the grease degradation phenomenon in CV joints is investigated by collecting grease samples from both <b>tripod</b> <b>joints</b> and Birfield joints in actual vehicles that traveled various ranges of distance. In order to analyze the property changes of grease, grease penetration and oxidation induced time are measured using a penetration meter and infrared (IR) spectrometer, respectively. Where oxygen in-duced time (OIT) is the point that the oxidation occurs in grease. The performance variations of grease are investigated by measuring the friction and wear using linear-oscillation (SRV, Schwingung (oscillation) Reibung (friction) Verschleiss (wear)) test machine as well as the four-ball wear tester. Degra-dation of properties as well as performance in CV joint grease due to physical and/or chemical changes is identified...|$|R

50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or <b>tripod</b> type <b>joint.</b> The <b>tripod</b> is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on needle roller bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} the {{lubricant}} properties on the lubricating performance of the <b>tripod</b> sliding universal <b>joint</b> were studied under thermal condition by numerical method. The obtained results show that increasing lubricant viscosity increases the film thickness whereas increasing viscosity-pressure coefficient or viscosity-temperature coefficient is just the reverse. The pressure hardly depends on the viscosity-pressure coefficient or viscosity-temperature coefficient, and a larger lubricant viscosity induces only a remarkable second pressure peak. Increasing lubricant viscosity or viscosity-pressure coefficient increases the temperature whereas the increasing viscosity-temperature coefficient reduces it...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{proposes a}} multi-body dynamic {{simulation}} to numerically evaluate the generated axial force(G. A. F) and plunging resistant force(P. R. F) practically {{related to the}} shudder and idling vibration of an automobile. A numerical analysis of two plunging types of CV <b>joints,</b> <b>tripod</b> joint(TJ) and very low axial tripod joint(VTJ), is conducted using the commercial program DAFUL. User-defined subroutines of a friction model illustrating the contacted parts of the outboard and inboard joint are subsequently developed to overcome the numerical instability and improve the solution performance. The Coulomb friction effect is applied to describe the contact models of the lubricated parts in the rolling and sliding mechanisms. The numerical results, {{in accordance with the}} joint articulation angle variation, are validated with experimentation. The offset between spider and tulip housing is demonstrated to be the critical role in producing the 3 rd order component of the axial force that potentially causes the noise and vibration in vehicle. The VTJ shows an excellent behavior for the shudder when compared with TJ. In addition, a flexible nonlinear contact analysis coupled with rigid multi-body dynamics is also performed to show the dynamic strength characteristics of the rollers, housing, and spider...|$|R
