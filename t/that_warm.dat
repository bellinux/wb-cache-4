5|$|Yagnavalkya {{explains}} <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> air inhaled {{passes to}} the Brahmarandhra via the navel which helps in curing diseases. When hot air is {{retained in the}} heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand petaled lotus, that then emerges in an inverted form. When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman (Atman), which is the heart, according to verses 12.15–22, the fire located {{in the region of}} Susumna, which is between the eyebrows glows. These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead to the perception of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire-like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta (mind).|$|E
25|$|In April 1898 Valette went to Arcachon, to {{the south}} of Bordeaux, in the hope <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> weather and mineral water would cure her tuberculosis. She died at Arcachon on 21 March 1899, aged forty-eight.|$|E

25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for engine oil so <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass defogging.|$|E
25|$|His basic {{assumptions}} {{were very}} similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).|$|E
25|$|Modern mammals have {{respiratory}} turbinates, convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. These {{are lined with}} mucous membranes <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air. An animal with respiratory turbinates can maintain {{a high rate of}} breathing without the danger of drying its lungs out, and therefore may have a fast metabolism. Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{a general}} lack of {{suitably}} detailed maps, Michaels found a map published by Ernst Hofer, a photographer who did aerial surveys of the area in the early 1950s, which showed the Warming Island landmass unconnected to Greenland. Michaels concluded therefore <b>that</b> <b>Warming</b> Island was also a separate island when observed by Hofer in the 1950s, and more broadly <b>that</b> <b>Warming</b> Island is an example of unjustified concern about the future outcomes of global warming.|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} common {{ostriches}} also employ a ‘selective brain warming’ mechanism {{in response to}} cooler surrounding temperatures in the evenings. The brain was found to maintain a warmer temperature when compared to carotid arterial blood supply. Researchers hypothesize three mechanisms for this finding. They first suggest a possible increase in metabolic heat production within the brain tissue itself {{to compensate for the}} colder arterial blood arriving from the core. They also speculate that there is an overall decrease in cerebral blood flow to the brain. Finally, they suggest <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> venous blood perfusion at the ophthalmic rete facilitates warming of cerebral blood that supplies the hypothalamus. Further research will need to be done to find how this occurs.|$|E
25|$|The pit organ will {{adapt to}} a {{repeated}} stimulus; if an adapted stimulus is removed, {{there will be a}} fluctuation in the opposite direction. For example, if a warm object is placed in front of the snake, the organ will increase in firing rate at first, but after a while will adapt to the warm object and the firing rate of the nerves in the pit organ will return to normal. If <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> object is then removed, the pit organ will now register the space that it used to occupy as being colder, and as such the firing rate will be depressed until it adapts to the removal of the object. The latency period of adaptation is approximately 50-150ms.|$|E
25|$|The {{watershed}} includes School Section Lakes, Goggins Lake, Long Lake and Benz Lake. Brown's Creek {{flows through}} the Brown's Creek Park and Nature Preserve northwest of Stillwater, then proceeds east to it confluence with the St. Croix River. At one time in its history, Brown’s Creek was diverted into McKusick Lake, which supplied water to Stillwater residents. By 1955 fisheries managers recognized <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> lake water was putting a strain on the trout population in Brown’s Creek. In {{an effort to reduce}} water temperatures for the benefit of trout, a dike was constructed to separate the stream from the lake and return the flow back to Brown’s Creek. The dike still exists today. In 1999, Browns Creek underwent a re-route in the fall of 1999 that shortened this section of the stream from 5,130 feet to 2,000 feet in order to lower water temperatures by avoiding water warming in previous meander through a wetland just north of Lake McKusick, increasing stream velocity and decreasing organic matter in the stream. This project by the city of Stillwater and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources also restored natural riparian vegetation as the creek traverses the Oak Glen Golf Course.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{temperature}} and the moisture content of the mound are critical to the survival {{and development of the}} eggs, so both are carefully regulated for {{the entire length of the}} breeding season (which may last for as long as eight months), principally by the male. Ornithologists believe that megapodes may use sensitive areas in their mouths to assess mound temperatures; each day during the breeding season, the male digs a pit into his mound and sticks his head in. If the mound's core temperature is a bit low, he adds fresh moist material to the mound, and stirs it in; if it is too high, he opens the top of the mound to allow some of the excess heat to escape. This regular monitoring also keeps the mound's material from becoming compacted, which would inhibit oxygen diffusion to the eggs and make it more difficult for the chicks to emerge after hatching. The malleefowl, which lives in more open forest than do other megapodes, uses the sun to help warm its nest as well—opening the mound at midday during the cool spring and autumn months to expose the plentiful sand incorporated into the nest to the sun's warming rays, then using <b>that</b> <b>warm</b> sand to insulate the eggs during the cold nights. During hot summer months, the malleefowl opens its nest mound only in the cool early morning hours, allowing excess heat to escape before recovering the mound completely. One recent study showed that the sex ratio of Australian brushturkey hatchlings correlated strongly with mound temperatures; females hatched from eggs incubated at higher mean temperatures.|$|E
