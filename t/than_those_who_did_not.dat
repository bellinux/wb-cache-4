5|$|A 2013 {{survey of}} {{executive}} directors of non-profit organizations in Boston {{found that the}} organizations were 6.3 {{times more likely to}} engage in policy advocacy if they had taken a 501(h) election <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature. A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli pupae prey {{upon their}} broodmates, while {{producing}} sugar-rich secretions which worker ants imbibe. In one experiment, P. rebeli specimens which consumed ant larvae developed more quickly <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> However, despite their nourishing offering to the community, they invariably imposed {{a net loss}} in the survival rates of workers and broodmates, demonstrating that the species is parasitic (rather than mutualistic) at all stages in its host colony.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools were more likely <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> to {{have been diagnosed with}} at least one chronic medical condition. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21% have been diagnosed with major depression; 7% have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7% have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

50|$|Young {{mothers who}} are given {{high-quality}} maternity care have significantly healthier babies <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not. Many of the health-issues associated with teenage mothers appear to result from {{lack of access to}} adequate medical care.|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} effects of surgery (e.g., pain/fatigue) {{were the main}} barriers to RTW in our study. All patients {{in a study by}} Maillette et al. [15] <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not RTW after TKA reported more pain <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> RTW.|$|R

Farmers who adopted GM crops made 69% higher profits <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> The review found that GM crops help farmers in developing countries, increasing yields by 14 percentage points.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be {{cross-cultural}} similarities in brain responses to first impression formations. In a mock election both American and Japanese individuals voted for the candidate that elicited a stronger response in their bilateral amygdala <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> regardless of the candidate's culture. Individuals also showed a stronger response to cultural outgroup faces than cultural ingroup faces because the amygdala is presumably more sensitive to novel stimuli. However, this finding was unrelated to actual voting decisions.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{in adolescent}} mothers can be predicted prenatally. Mothers who talked lively and positively {{about their future}} relationship with the child were found to display higher maternal sensitivity <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> (classified as autonomous mothers). Autonomous mothers were also found to have infants with a more secure attachment. Adolescent mothers who were not classified as autonomous {{were found to have}} anxiously attached infants. Furthermore, adolescent mothers were found to have children four–eight years old with lower IQs and a below-average reading level, than did adult mothers.|$|E

50|$|Overconfidence can be {{beneficial}} to individual self-esteem as well as giving an individual the will to succeed in their desired goal. Just believing in oneself may give one the will to take one's endeavours further <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{conducted}} by the APPA show substantial evidence that young adults who {{feel a sense of}} belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have the feeling of love and belonging.|$|R
25|$|When {{children}} {{listen to}} stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing attention {{and accept the}} extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events {{and the importance of}} oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the Tohono O'odham American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> engage in cultural practices. Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations. Elders, parents and grandparents are typically involved in teaching the children the cultural ways, along with history, community values and teachings of the land.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{involving}} women facing cancer-related difficulties such as fear, pain, altered social relationships, etc., it {{was found}} that: Engaging in different types of visual art (textiles, card making, collage, pottery, watercolor, acrylics) helped these women in 4 major ways. First, it helped them focus on positive life experiences, relieving their ongoing preoccupation with cancer. Second, it enhanced their self-worth and identity by providing them with opportunities to demonstrate continuity, challenge, and achievement. Third, it enabled them to maintain a social identity that resisted being defined by cancer. Finally, it allowed them to express their feelings in a symbolic manner, especially during chemotherapy. Another study showed {{those who participated in}} these types of activities were discharged earlier <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> participate.|$|E
25|$|The mere-exposure effect {{exists in}} most areas of human {{decision}} making. For example, many stock traders tend to invest in securities of domestic companies merely {{because they are more}} familiar with them despite the fact that international markets offer similar or even better alternatives. The mere-exposure effect also distorts the results of journal ranking surveys; those academics who previously published or completed reviews for a particular academic journal rate it dramatically higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> There are mixed results {{on the question of whether}} mere exposure can promote good relations between different social groups. When groups already have negative attitudes to each other, further exposure can increase hostility. A statistical analysis of voting patterns found that a candidate's exposure has a strong effect on the number of votes they receive, distinct from the popularity of the policies.|$|E
30|$|Exposure to mass media: Women who {{reported}} {{listening to the}} radio are less likely to support wife-beating <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not listen to the radio. However, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> watch television are more likely to justify wife-beating as compared to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not watch television.|$|R
50|$|The {{patient may}} be {{prescribed}} a liquid-only diet, followed by mushy foods and then solids. This is prescribed for a varied {{length of time}} and each surgeon and manufacturer varies. Some may find that before their first fill, they are still able to eat fairly large portions. This is not surprising since before the fill {{there is little or}} no restriction in the band. This is why a proper post-op diet and a good after-care plan are essential to success. A recent study found that patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not change their eating habits were 2.2 times more likely to be unsuccessful <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did,</b> and that patients who had not increased their physical activity were 2.3 times more likely to be unsuccessful <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{older persons}} {{admitted}} to hospital, individuals experiencing delirium {{are twice as}} likely to die <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not (meta-analysis of 12 studies). In the only prospective study conducted in the general population, older persons reporting delirium also showed higher mortality (60% increase).|$|R
25|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder: Spanish researchers analysed the diets of 12,059 {{people over}} six years and found those who ate the most trans fats had a 48 per cent higher risk of depression <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> eat trans fats. One mechanism may be trans-fats' substitution for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Very high intake of trans-fatty acids (43% of total fat) in mice from 2 to 16 months of age was associated with lowered DHA levels in the brain (p=0.001). When the brains of 15 major depressive subjects who had committed suicide were examined post-mortem and compared against 27 age-matched controls, the suicidal brains {{were found to have}} 16% less (male average) to 32% less (female average) DHA in the OFC. The OFC controls reward, reward expectation, and empathy (all of which are reduced in depressive mood disorders) and regulates the limbic system.|$|E
25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to have a heart attack, <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have these cancers.|$|E
25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not asked to rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> receive repeated exposure.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} has also {{on several occasions}} offered statistics suggesting the correlation between community service and academic performance.

40|$|Health {{benefits}} of dog walking are established in adults: dog owners are on average more physically active and those walking their dogs regularly have lower weight status <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not. However, {{there has been}} little research on children. A survey of pet ownership and involvement in dog walking was combined with fitness and weight status measurements of 1021 9 - 10 yrs old children, in the Liverpool SportsLinx study. We found little evidence to support that children who live with, or walk with, dogs, are any fitter or less likely to be obese <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not. This is an important finding as it suggests that the activity that children currently do with dogs is not sufficient enough to impact weight status or fitness...|$|R

25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind {{study of the}} Mayo Clinic found {{no significant difference in}} the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E
500|$|Some historians view {{cases of}} {{cross-dressing}} {{women to be}} manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire, or their way of making sense out of their desire for women. Lillian Faderman argues that Western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles. Catharine Linck and other women who were accused of using dildos, such as two nuns in 16th century Spain executed for using [...] "material instruments", were punished more severely <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Two marriages between women were recorded in Cheshire, England, in 1707 (between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill) and 1708 (between Ane Norton and Alice Pickford) with no comment about both parties being female. Reports of clergymen with lax standards who performed weddings—and wrote their suspicions about {{one member of the}} wedding party—continued to appear for the next century.|$|E
500|$|Subjective {{frequency}} is {{how frequently}} subjects [...] a stimulus appears. Name {{letters may be}} noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the [...] frequency was identical. Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be {{an explanation for the}} name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect. The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.|$|E
