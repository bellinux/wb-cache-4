5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a royalty rate of $1 per unit. The royalty only applies to final products {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI product <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> subject to the royalty. For example, an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV.|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E

25|$|Gadamer {{writes that}} human {{tradition}} and reason {{can serve as}} a standard of measure for testing uncovered truths and avoiding relativism. Heidegger states that we can avoid relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, or something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> given in existence that informs our theorizing. Additionally, hermeneutic psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E

Thanks to Steve Cole being the guiding influence from start to finish, the SFU has far fewer inconsistencies than the canon Star Trek universe.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{formation}} mechanisms for the different types of nebulae.

In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|Thermohaline {{circulation}} is {{the principal}} driving force of deepwater bottom-currents. The term refers to the movement of water over large distances {{as a consequence of}} global oceanic density gradients. This circulation commonly travels at velocities between 2 – 20cm/s. Note that at this velocity range, considering the general shape of the Shields diagram still holds in these conditions, a flow will only be able to continue transporting finer sediment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> in suspension but {{will not be able to}} erode the same sized sediment once it is deposited. However, flow velocity may be intensified as a consequence of the Coriolis force driving currents west against continental margins or as current squeezes between two ridges.|$|E
