50|$|The Spanish layer, {{entering}} last, also terminates earliest. The Chinese layer, entering second, yet outlives the Spanish.

But five minutes {{before the end of}} the last tabuh, the instruments from the Chinese and Spanish ensembles re-enter by gradual degrees to be reintegrated as a symphony orchestra. Ching then inserts a dissonant, polytonal version of the opening of Wagner's Das Rheingold, the intervals inverted into the opening of The Star-spangled Banner. Explaining the work's unexpected conclusion, the composer writes:While Tabuh VIII carries on to its own close, it is engulfed by portents of post-1898 events—in particular, the sinking of the USS Maine—in the unmistakable guise of the Wagnerian Rhinegold of free-market capitalism and election-year demagoguery. The bar-lines, once disparate, now line up, as if by way of metaphor for the cultural levelling of the global village. This is at once apotheosis and lampoon, as the quotation and metamorphoses of the world’s best-known national anthem make clear. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> intended in my Third Symphony is not too obscure: The best, the richest, the most glorious part of a country’s heritage is also her past—in the case of a country like the Philippines, first and foremost her Asian past, shared to a large extent with her East and Southeast Asian neighbours, but also, since the Spanish Conquest, the high civilisation of Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, which touched off many a sympathetic vibration in her native spirit. 1898 may have brought about the end of Spanish rule, but it was also the logical culmination of over three hundred years of it. What followed, on the other hand, was a fundamental psychical disruption. The sense of the hierarchical, the numinous, the ceremonious, and the patrician—common to Asia and Europe alike—has no place in the Republic of Mob Rule and Pursuit of Profit. Yet we let it vanish at our peril. Human rites, as much as rights, are worth dying for.|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{of the available}} judgment and memory data on the sleeper effect in persuasion is presented. According to this effect, when people receive a communication associated with a discounting cue, such as a noncredible source, they are less persuaded immediately after exposure than they are later in time. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that recipients of discounting cues were more persuaded over time when <b>the</b> <b>message</b> arguments and <b>the</b> cue had a strong initial impact.

50|$|In his own words, Morgan said: I was {{a student}} back in 2002 at (then) BIFHE on the Performing Arts Acting Course in Tower Street. I have now {{recently}} been contacted by many of my past colleagues informing me of the plans to cancel the performing arts course and I am completely appalled {{that this is the}} case. At the age of sixteen, a boy from Armagh, BIFHE was {{one of the very few}} options I had of being able to pursue my passion and ambition to act. Without that course I would have been lost and forced to choose subjects in a local technical college that I had no interest in doing and things could have taken a very different turn for my future.As it happens, BIFHE was there for me and offered me the opportunity to hone and develop my desire to act, study the craft that acting has the potential to be, learn from my peers and have the opportunity to perform in a safe environment, to gain a qualification and enabled me to then progress on the study at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and I have been working consistently in the profession now for nearly eight years and I credit BIFHE as being a vital step in where I am now.The impact of cancelling this course will have a detrimental effect to all those young people, like me, who are trying to make a future and a career out of performance. What message is being sent here by cancelling the course? To me it's a clear message of dismissal to the talent that exists in our country, it's a denial of development, it's an ignorance to the possibility of aspiration in the business and it's a failure to support a vital and thriving industry which Northern Ireland is now benefitting from.It's hard enough to try and make it as an actor from Northern Ireland as it is. I was forced to leave the country after studying at BIFHE because the opportunity to study at drama school wasn't available at home. The knowledge that the opportunity to enable young people to even apply (and have the ability and confidence to apply) to drama school is now being cut off just seems ludicrous. Are we saying that it's ok for major filming projects to come and film in Northern Ireland but our young people here aren't worthy to be trained to be a part of it?What are our options? How can we prevent this from happening? And if our message and our voice isn't being heard on this, then I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> becomes even clearer: acting and performance is not being treated as a serious career option for people in Northern Ireland. And I, and many other Northern Irish actors working professionally today, are here to say that it is achievable but we need all the help we can get.I hope in some way that we can turn things around and not let this disappointing blow happen to the future of our country's aspiring performers.|$|E

50|$|A major {{criticism}} of HSM {{is that the}} model closely relates to ELM, {{which is also a}} dual-processing model discussing paths to persuasion. The main similarity between the two models is that they both discuss two routes of persuasion, which either examines central or systematic processing in particular. The differences between HSM and ELM are that ELM discusses two main routes of persuasion processing: central route processing and peripheral route processing unlike HSM. These two routes of processing define related theories behind attitude change. The central route is reflective and requires a willingness to process and <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> peripheral route occurs when attitudes are formed without extensive thought, but more from mental shortcuts, credibility, and appearance cues. The route of persuasion processing depends on the level of involvement in the topic or issue. High involvement or elaboration increases central route processing especially when motivation and ability in <b>the</b> <b>message</b> exists. Therefore, low involvement increases peripheral route processing when motivation and ability conditions of persuasion do not exist. However, if the topic or idea is irrelevant to the individual, then <b>the</b> <b>message</b> takes <b>the</b> peripheral route.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{transformation}} {{of a normal}} cell into a cancer cell takes place through a sequence of {{a small number of}} discrete genetic events, somatic mutations: thus, cancer can be regarded properly as a genetic disease of somatic cells. The analogy between evolution of organisms and evolution of cell populations is compelling: in both cases what drives change is mutation, but it is Darwinian selection that enables clones that have a growth advantage to expand, thus providing a larger target size for the next mutation to hit. The search for molecular lesions in tumors has taken on a new dimension thanks to two powerful technologies: the micro-arrays for quantitative analysis of global gene expresssion (the transcriptome); and ‘deep’ sequencing for the global analysis of the entire genome (or at least the exome). The former offers the most complete phenotypic characterization of a tumor we could ever hope for – we could call this the ultimate phenotype; the latter can identify all the somatic mutations in an individual tumor – we could call this the somatic genotype. However, there is definitely the risk that while we are ‘drowned by data, we remain thirsty for knowledge’. If we want to heed the teachings of Lorenzo Tomatis, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is clear: we ought {{to take advantage of the}} new powerful technologies – not by becoming their slaves, but remaining their masters. Identifying somatic mutations in a tumor is important not because it qualifies for ‘oncogenomics’, but because through a deeper understanding of the nature of that particular tumor it can help us to optimize therapy or to design new therapeutic approaches. </p...|$|E

"Matsuranomiya Monogatari" is consumed with the love a main character doesn't bear and the fl ow which wanders to a foreign land is also parallel with "Tales of Ise". "Matsuranomiya Monogatari" but Ujitada's mind was drawn, making "Tales of Ise" a pre text, and argued that a story is being advanced.

40|$|Abstract Since {{publication}} of Environmental Health 2011, 10 (Suppl 1) :S 12 1 {{it has been}} noticed that titles and captions for the figures and tables were incorrectly applied. In this full-length correction article, figures and tables have been renumbered with legends and captions applied appropriately. Some minor typographical errors have also been corrected. The inconvenience caused to readers by premature {{publication of}} the original paper is regretted. The transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell takes place through a sequence of {{a small number of}} discrete genetic events, somatic mutations: thus, cancer can be regarded properly as a genetic disease of somatic cells. The analogy between evolution of organisms and evolution of cell populations is compelling: in both cases what drives change is mutation, but it is Darwinian selection that enables clones that have a growth advantage to expand, thus providing a larger target size for the next mutation to hit. The search for molecular lesions in tumors has taken on a new dimension thanks to two powerful technologies: the micro-arrays for quantitative analysis of global gene expresssion (the transcriptome); and ‘deep’ sequencing for the global analysis of the entire genome (or at least the exome). The former offers the most complete phenotypic characterization of a tumor we could ever hope for – we could call this the ultimate phenotype; the latter can identify all the somatic mutations in an individual tumor – we could call this the somatic genotype. However, there is definitely the risk that while we are ‘drowned by data, we remain thirsty for knowledge’. If we want to heed the teachings of Lorenzo Tomatis, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is clear: we ought {{to take advantage of the}} new powerful technologies – not by becoming their slaves, but remaining their masters. Identifying somatic mutations in a tumor is important because through a deeper understanding of the nature of that particular tumor it can help us to optimize therapy or to design new therapeutic approaches. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mental {{illness is}} a {{widespread}} public health concern. Stigma is a known barrier to recovery, and individuals often avoid seeking treatment because of it. The purpose of my research was to understand how individuals process peer-created, mental illness messages on social media, {{and to what extent}} these messages reduce stigma. I conducted two experiments based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to examine attitudes related to negative beliefs about mental illness and preferred social distance from mentally ill individuals. Argument quality and amount of elaboration influenced empathetic responses to a message. Empathy was directly associated with a decrease in stigmatized beliefs about mental illness. Individuals who perceived that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> sharer was a close, trusted friend were more likely to indicate that <b>the</b> original <b>message</b> creator was more credible. Original message creators who disclosed having a mental illness were also perceived as more credible than creators who did not disclose having a mental illness. In addition, participants who perceived that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> sharer positively endorsed <b>the</b> <b>message</b> had less stigmatized beliefs about mental illness than participants who perceived negative endorsements. Results of this project suggest that traditional ELM variables, such as elaboration and argument quality, influence the processing and outcomes of viewing social media messages about mental illness. Several new media characteristics, such as who shares <b>the</b> <b>message</b> online and comments they attach to <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> also influence how users <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and influence processing outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|Inspired, Rimmer {{decides to}} play <b>the</b> <b>message</b> on <b>the</b> holo-lamp {{so that he}} can prove to himself he doesn't care what his father <b>thinks.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>message</b> gives him a {{shocking}} revelation - Rimmer's father isn't his biological father. His real father is the family gardener, [...] "Dungo". Although shaken by this news, Rimmer manages to turn it around in his favour. He reckons his real father, a humble gardener, would have been proud of his accomplishments (i.e.: second technician in the JMC, senior officer of a mining ship, and he [...] "doesn't smell of manure"). With his new-found confidence, he comes up with a plan of action. At first, the others dismiss his plan as being [...] "crap" [...] and put it to a vote. With all three voting against it, Rimmer almost votes with them, but remembering how his father humiliated him in school, he stands by his decision, and in a rare show of bravery, he tells his crew-mates that they can do this. Rousing them together, they all agree and fly Blue Midget out of the asteroid belt.|$|R
50|$|The central {{route is}} used when <b>the</b> <b>message</b> {{recipient}} has <b>the</b> motivation {{as well as}} <b>the</b> ability to <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and its topic. When people process information centrally, the cognitive responses, or elaborations, {{will be much more}} relevant to the information, whereas when processing peripherally, the individual may rely on heuristics and other rules of thumb when elaborating on a <b>message.</b> Being at <b>the</b> high end of the elaboration continuum, people assess object-relevant information in relation to schemas that they already possess, and arrive at a reasoned attitude that is supported by information. It is important to consider two types of factors that influence how and how much one will elaborate on a persuasive <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> first are the factors that influence our motivation to elaborate, and the second being the factors that influence our ability to elaborate. Motivation to process <b>the</b> <b>message</b> may be determined by a personal interest in the subject of <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> or individual factors like the need for cognition. However, if <b>the</b> <b>message</b> recipient has a strong, negative attitude toward the position proposed by <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> a boomerang effect (an opposite effect) is likely to occur. That is, they will resist <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> and may move away from the proposed position. Two advantages of the central route are that attitude changes tend to last longer and are more predictive of behavior than the changes from the peripheral route. Overall, as people’s motivation and ability to process <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and develop elaborations decreases, the peripheral cues present in the situation become more important in their processing of <b>the</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
