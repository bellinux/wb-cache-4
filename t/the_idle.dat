5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to <b>the</b> <b>Idle</b> Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
40|$|Recently, an idling {{mechanism}} {{has been}} introduced {{in the context of}} distributed first order methods for minimization of a sum of nodes' local convex costs over a generic, connected network. With <b>the</b> <b>idling</b> mechanism, each node i, at each iteration k, is active [...] updates its solution estimate and exchanges messages with its network neighborhood [...] with probability p_k, and it stays idle with probability 1 -p_k, while the activations are independent both across nodes and across iterations. In this paper, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>idling</b> mechanism can be successfully incorporated in distributed second order methods also. Specifically, we apply <b>the</b> <b>idling</b> mechanism to <b>the</b> recently proposed Distributed Quasi Newton method (DQN). We first show theoretically that, when p_k grows to one across iterations in a controlled manner, DQN with idling exhibits very similar theoretical convergence and convergence rates properties as the standard DQN method, thus achieving the same order of convergence rate (R-linear) as the standard DQN, but with significantly cheaper updates. Simulation examples confirm the benefits of incorporating <b>the</b> <b>idling</b> mechanism, demonstrate <b>the</b> method's flexibility with respect to the choice of the p_k's, and compare <b>the</b> proposed <b>idling</b> method with related algorithms from the literature.

Thirty Flights of Loving received generally favorable reviews from video game media outlets, scoring 88 out of 100 on aggregate website Metacritic.

5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is {{based on the number of}} houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short <b>The</b> <b>Idle</b> Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich.

They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> capacity of the economy.|$|E

5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s.

Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004.|$|E

5|$|All {{four of the}} Ganguts were {{assigned}} to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors. Their turrets and fire-control systems, however, were still being adjusted and fine-tuned through the next spring. Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic. Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916, often while providing cover for minelaying operations, but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, {{and other types}} of molecular dynamics. The project uses <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E
