5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable.

5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E

5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, <b>therefore</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not uncommon for bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known as the Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time}} with six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and <b>therefore</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E

The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures {{of only a few}} degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and <b>therefore</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
