This was following a 2009 inspection report which stated, “Much about this dam is not known due to poor documentation during initial construction and subsequent modifications.

25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on the mass <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b> The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side <b>of</b> the <b>dam).</b> The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream <b>of</b> the <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When the seepage {{velocity}} {{is great}} enough, erosion can occur {{because of the}} frictional drag exerted on the soil particles.

Erosion of the soil, known as [...] "soil piping", can lead to failure of the structure and to sinkhole formation. Seeping water removes soil, starting from the exit point of the seepage, and erosion advances upgradient.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Stepped spillways {{constructed}} of roller compacted concrete (RCC) is a hydraulic and cost effective measure to dissipate energy of large water flows over the spillway <b>of</b> a <b>dam.</b> Stepped spillways, like other spillway types, have its limitations and {{a measure to}} improve the energy dissipation effectiveness is proposed. Two hydraulic models were constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) in Pretoria, South Africa. The scales of the models were 1 : 20 and 1 : 30. The study proposes the use of triangular protrusions applied over the spillway surface. The protrusions have the same height as the steps, with {{the width of the}} protrusions varying. The triangular protrusions deflect the water sideways resulting in higher energy losses. The results indicate that the protrusions reduce scouring at the <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam,</b> thus increasing the roughness of the steps. It also indicate that aeration occur earlier than with normal stepped spillways. An optimal spacing, lateral and across the steps, are proposed. The construction of the protrusions is also discussed, as well as the cost implications. It is concluded that the protrusions are effective at a unit discharge up to 35 m 3 /s. m. This value is however dependent on the configuration of the apron downstream <b>of</b> the <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b> It is proposed that protrusions be added on the downstream face <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> on every second step, with one protrusion and then no protrusion alternating in the flow path. It is recommended that the protrusions be cast in situ...|$|R
