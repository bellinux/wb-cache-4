25|$|F/X (also {{known as}} or subtitled Murder by Illusion) is a 1986 American action-thriller film {{directed}} by Robert Mandel, written by Gregory Fleeman and Robert T. Megginson, and starring Bryan Brown, Brian Dennehy, Diane Venora, and Cliff De Young. The film follows an expert (Brown) {{in the art}} of special effects (F/X) with a reputation built by his work on many low-budget hack-and-slash films such as I Dismember Mama. The Department of Justice hires him to stage the murder of a gangster about to enter the Witness Protection Program. He agrees, but <b>then</b> <b>things</b> get complicated. Meanwhile, a New York City police detective (Dennehy) is investigating the faked murder and cannot understand why the Justice Department is even less helpful than usual.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Vikings {{entered a}} {{rebuilding}} year. After the heartbreak of previous seasons many veteran players retired from football leaving the Vikings {{with the task}} of re-inventing themselves. They competed in the newly formed SBC South and finished with a 6–2 record. For the second time in 3 years the Vikings season was hampered by forfeits and teams no fulfilling fixtures. As DCU left the league before the season the south was left with 4 teams. <b>Then</b> <b>things</b> got worse the Cork Admirals folded after just one game leaving the south with 3 teams and none of those teams getting the normal 8 games. The Vikings lost 2 of 3 fixtures with Trinity meaning they would qualify as the second seed in the south. The highlight of the regular season being a 13–12 victory over Trinity in Limerick.|$|E

25|$|<b>Then</b> <b>things</b> {{fell apart}} for Tennessee. Backed {{up at their}} own 11-yard line by a Shane Lechler punt and simply trying to run out the clock, running back Robert Holcombe fumbled the ball while being tackled by Raiders linebacker Eric Barton, and {{defensive}} back Anthony Dorsett, Holcombe's old teammate {{who was a member}} of the Titans when they reached Super Bowl XXXIV, recovered the ball at the Tennessee 16-yard line. On the next play, Rice caught a 15-yard reception at the 1-yard line, and then Gannon found Doug Jolley in the back of the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown pass, giving the Raiders a 21–17 lead. Then on the ensuing kickoff, rookie returner John Simon was stripped of the ball by Tim Johnson and Alvis Whitted recovered the fumble for Oakland on the Titans 39-yard line, setting up a 43-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski on the last play of the first half, making the score 24-17.|$|E
25|$|But by <b>then</b> <b>things</b> were changing. King Henry IV died in 1413 {{and his son}} King Henry V {{began to}} adopt a more conciliatory {{attitude}} to the Welsh. Royal Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. In a symbolic and pious gesture, the body of deposed King Richard II was interred in Westminster Abbey. In 1415 Henry V offered a Pardon to Owain, as he prepared for war with France. There {{is evidence that the}} new King Henry V was in negotiations with Owain's son, Maredudd ab Owain Glyndŵr, but nothing was to come of it. In 1416 Maredudd was himself offered a Pardon but refused. Perhaps his father Owain was still alive and he was unwilling to accept it while he lived. He finally accepted a Royal Pardon in 1421, suggesting that Owain Glyndŵr was finally dead. There is some evidence to suggest, in the poetry of the Welsh Bard Llawdden for example, that a few diehards continued to fight on even after 1421 under the leadership of Owain's son-in-law Phylib ap Rhys.|$|E
25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, <b>then</b> <b>things</b> on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only {{one or two of the}} subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E

500|$|The lack {{of record}} sales was {{largely due to}} the fellow punk band Sex Pistols turning people off the genre [...] "with their antisocial behavior," [...] as put by author Brian J. Bowe. Rock music {{historian}} Legs McNeil relates: [...] "Safety pins, razor blades, chopped haircuts, snarling, vomiting—everything {{that had nothing to do}} with the Ramones was suddenly in vogue, and it killed any chance Rocket to Russia had of getting any airplay." [...] Joey also insisted that the Sex Pistols were partially responsible for the low sale numbers, concluding that before 60 Minutess focused on the Sex Pistols, Rocket to Russia had decent airplay. After this, Joey asserted that [...] "everyone flipped out and <b>then</b> <b>things</b> changed radically. It really kind of screwed things up for ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn't think would ever float, they float. [...] Or <b>then</b> <b>things</b> that you hope would float actually sink and you can't find them anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|While Dylan was {{dismissive of}} the Beatles' {{landmark}} album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), Harrison remained an avowed fan of Dylan's work – Blonde on Blonde {{being the only}} Western music that Harrison took with him to India in February 1968. Following the sessions for the Beatles' White Album, Harrison worked in Los Angeles for much of October and November 1968, producing the debut solo album by Jackie Lomax, {{one of the first}} signings to the Beatles' Apple record label. Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, then spent Thanksgiving with the Dylans while staying in the Catskills as guests of manager Albert Grossman. Despite Dylan's excitement at their arrival, Harrison found him withdrawn and seemingly lacking in confidence. Music journalist John Harris notes that, unlike in their previous meetings, [...] "there were no hangers-on , Dylan's head was clear, and the protective barriers of cool could come down – which, eventually, they did." [...] On the third day, Harrison recalls in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, [...] "we got the guitars out and <b>then</b> <b>things</b> loosened up".|$|E

500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and <b>then</b> <b>things</b> are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Big Big Beat" [...] {{is a house}} song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-four seconds, and contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice. Before {{the release of the}} song, Banks described the single as giving [...] "Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense that both contain [...] "fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor-ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track [...] "fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed-up digi-hi-hat beat", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as [...] "maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing [...] "'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing the swing of programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party really gets started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, <b>then</b> <b>things</b> smooth out just a bit as AB flexes her vocals on the chorus". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as [...] "glittery synthesizers", alluding that Banks had returned [...] "swinging and vogueing" [...] on the song.|$|E
