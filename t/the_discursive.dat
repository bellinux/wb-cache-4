25|$|In stylistic {{terms the}} motets of the Gradualia form a sharp {{contrast}} {{to those of the}} Cantiones sacrae publications. The vast majority are shorter, with <b>the</b> <b>discursive</b> imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 Gradualia are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). For obvious reasons, the Gradualia never achieved the popularity of Byrd's earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication {{in the light of the}} renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610.|$|E

In {{a study of}} the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were [...] "often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic mistiness and 'atmosphere'. In fact they have considerable strength and frequent astringence; and formally the thematic material is presented with consistency and purpose." [...] In Herbage's view, the cycle can be seen to fall into two groups – the first three and the last three – with the Fourth Symphony as [...] "an extrovert interlude between these largely introspective works". Handley agreed that the first three could be grouped together; Foreman sees a Celtic influence in all three, with Bax's emotions about the Easter rising and its aftermath discernible. The Fourth is generally regarded as a more optimistic work than its predecessors and successors. Handley calls it [...] "festive", but comments that its ideas developed into darker mood in the Fifth and Sixth. The Fifth is, for Herbage, [...] "the greatest tour-de-force"; the Sixth stands out for its [...] "magnificent final movement", which the critic Peter Pirie said [...] "tears the earth up by its roots"; and the Seventh, {{in the view of the}} Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, has an elegiac tone, its simplicity far removed from <b>the</b> <b>discursive</b> and complex music of Bax's earlier years.|$|E

In keeping with the baroque style, Stephenson's books have become longer as he has gained recognition.

2500|$|The Rasta message {{resonates with}} {{many people who}} feel marginalised and alienated by the values and {{institutions}} of their society.

2500|$|Whilst {{the above}} {{conception}} of aid {{has been the}} most pervasive within development geography work, {{it is important to remember}} that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of [...] "LEDCs", as well as <b>the</b> <b>discursive</b> symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states. Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011 and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{emergence}} of the public sphere in the 18th century, Jürgen Habermas noted that the public realm, or sphere, originally was [...] "coextensive with public authority", while [...] "the private sphere comprised civil society in the narrower sense, that is to say, the realm of commodity exchange and of social labor". Whereas the [...] "sphere of public authority" [...] dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class,or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the [...] "authentic 'public sphere, in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and [...] "through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society". [...] "This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [...] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state." [...] The public sphere [...] "is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of <b>the</b> <b>discursive</b> relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling". These distinctions between [...] "state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations...are essential to democratic theory". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action.|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I aim {{to establish}} that the contemporary theory of incorporation rests on incoherent assumptions. Using a historical approach, I distinguish three different historical <b>discursive</b> formations underlying <b>the</b> contemporary concept of incorporation. On {{the basis of a}} comparison of these three historical discursive formations I argue that the contemporary representation of incorporation {{is a result of the}} simultaneous use of these three formations, while <b>the</b> last <b>discursive</b> formation has become dominant. This leads to a description of two problems of justification. The first problem is that in the contemporary theory of incorporation <b>the</b> three historical <b>discursive</b> formations, with their mutually exclusive assumptions, are all maintained in order to retain their practical effects. The second problem is that the assumptions underlying <b>the</b> third <b>discursive</b> formation are dominant, although this discursive formation employs a theory of representation that rejects the fundamental assumptions of <b>the</b> previous <b>discursive</b> formations. Together, these two problems lead to a contemporary theory of incorporation that relates to three historical discursive formations for their effects, but relates incoherently and inconsistently to the historical justifications for these effects. I will argue that, as a result of this incoherence and inconsistency, the contemporary theory of incorporation introduces a singular reified representation, which leads to a reconceptualization of the basic concept of representation in the legal, economic, social and political systems of representations. Then, I will argue that this reconceptualization strongly favours incorporated reified singular legal representations over the legal, economic and political representation of natural persons. On this basis, I will conclude that the contemporary theory of incorporation leads to legal, economic, social and political theory that is based on fundamentally unequal types of representation with structural unequal attributions of agency, ownership and rights.
