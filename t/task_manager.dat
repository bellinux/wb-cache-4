5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has {{no support}} for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various {{features}} were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing {{an emphasis on}} cloud computing), such as {{an updated version of}} Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new version of Windows <b>Task</b> <b>Manager,</b> and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.|$|E
25|$|Control-Alt-Delete, often {{abbreviated}} as Ctrl-Alt-Del, is {{a computer}} keyboard command on PC compatible systems {{that can be used}} to reboot a computer, and summon the <b>task</b> <b>manager</b> or operating system. It is invoked by pressing the Delete key while holding the Control and Alt keys: Ctrl+Alt+Delete. Thus, it forces a soft reboot, brings up the <b>task</b> <b>manager</b> (on Windows and BeOS) or a jump to ROM monitor. Control-Alt-Delete was invented in 1981 by David Bradley while working at IBM.|$|E

25|$|Chrome {{includes}} a process management utility called <b>Task</b> <b>Manager</b> which lets users see what sites and plugins {{are using the}} most memory, downloading the most bytes and overusing the CPU and provides the ability to terminate them. Chrome Version 23 ensures its users an improved battery life for the systems supporting Chrome's GPU accelerated video decoding.|$|E
25|$|Group Policy, in part, {{controls}} what {{users can}} and cannot do {{on a computer}} system: for example, to enforce a password complexity policy that prevents users from choosing an overly simple password, to allow or prevent unidentified users from remote computers to connect to a network share, to block access to the Windows <b>Task</b> <b>Manager</b> or to restrict access to certain folders. A set of such configurations is called a Group Policy Object (GPO).|$|E

25|$|<b>Task</b> <b>Manager</b> {{has been}} redesigned, {{including}} a new processes tab with the option to display fewer or more details of running applications and background processes, a heat map using different colors indicating the level of resource usage, network and disk counters, grouping by process type (e.g. applications, background processes and Windows processes), friendly names for processes and a new option which allows users to search the web to find information about obscure processes. Additionally, the Blue Screen of Death has been updated with a simpler and modern design with less technical information displayed.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft added ASLR {{functionality}} in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. On this platform, DEP {{is implemented}} through the automatic use of PAE kernel in 32-bit Windows {{and the native}} support on 64-bit kernels. Windows Vista DEP works by marking certain parts of memory as being intended to hold only data, which the NX or XD bit enabled processor then understands as non-executable. In Windows, from version Vista, whether DEP is enabled or disabled for a particular process can be viewed on the Processes tab in the Windows <b>Task</b> <b>Manager.</b>|$|E
500|$|Windows Server 2012 {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Windows <b>Task</b> <b>Manager</b> together with the old version. In the new version the tabs are hidden by default, showing applications only. In the new Processes tab, the processes are displayed in varying shades of yellow, with darker shades representing heavier resource use. It lists application names and status, as well as CPU, memory, hard disk and network utilization. The process information found in the older versions are now moved to the new Details tab. The Performance tab shows [...] "CPU", [...] "Memory", [...] "Disk", [...] "Wi-Fi" [...] and [...] "Ethernet" [...] graphs. The CPU tab no longer displays individual graphs for every logical processor on the system by default, although that remains an option. Additionally, it can display data for each non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. When displaying data for each logical processor for machines with more than 64 logical processors, the CPU tab now displays simple utilization percentages on heat-mapping tiles. The color used for these heat maps is blue, with darker shades again indicating heavier utilization. Hovering the cursor over any logical processor's data now shows the NUMA node of that processor and its ID, if applicable. Additionally, a new Startup tab has been added that lists startup applications, however this tab does not exist in Windows Server 2012. The new <b>task</b> <b>manager</b> recognizes when a Windows Store app has the [...] "Suspended" [...] status.|$|E

One of the most required information during disaster response which helps to solve the situation awareness problem is geospatial data. This research analyses the media capabilities of OSM <b>Tasking</b> <b>Manager</b> when communicating Volunteered Geographic Information by applying case of Nepal Earthquake in 2015 April as the most recent natural disaster for the analysis. It was first attempted to define the crisis communication and its variables to clarify the scope of analysis. Second it was attempted to evaluate media capabilities in theory by considering {{the context in which the}} media is used and communication is taking place as Media Synchronicity Theory suggests. After conducting usability inspection and document analysis actual OSM <b>Tasking</b> <b>Manager</b> capabilities were evaluated regarding conveyance and convergence processes in production function. Results showed that OSM <b>Tasking</b> <b>Manager</b> is a very task oriented communication media that fulfils theoretically required media capabilities. Research also showed that Map Communication Model provided by Hoffman is highly applicable when analysing communication via interactive web mapping platforms...|$|R

Successive versions of Windows have introduced additional functionality into Winlogon, resulting in additional functionality {{that can be}} implemented by a replacement GINA. [...] Windows 2000, for example, introduced support for displaying status messages (including verbose messages that can be turned on through Group Policy) about the current state to the user (e.g. [...] "Applying computer settings..."), and starting applications in the user's context; this facilitates restarting Windows Explorer automatically if it crashes, as well as starting the <b>Task</b> <b>Manager.</b> Windows XP introduced support for Fast User Switching, Remote Desktop and a more interactive, simplified and user-friendly full-screen logon.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of {{the various}} editions of Windows 8 have been mixed. Tom Warren of The Verge said that {{although}} Windows 8's emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users, he felt that Windows 8 tablets [...] " [...] an iPad feel immediately out of date" [...] due to {{the capabilities of the}} operating system's hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services. David Pierce of The Verge described Windows 8 as [...] "the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012" [...] and praised Microsoft's [...] "no compromise" [...] approach and the operating system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services. Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a [...] "brilliant innovation for desktop computers" [...] when compared with [...] "folder-littered desktops on every other OS" [...] because it allows users to interact with dynamic information. In contrast, an ExtremeTech article said it was Microsoft [...] "flailing" [...] and a review in PC Magazine condemned the Metro-style user interface. Some of the included apps in Windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality, but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi-platform entertainment experience. Other improvements and features (such as File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated <b>Task</b> <b>Manager)</b> were also regarded as positive changes. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them, Windows 8's improved performance, updated file manager, new storage functionality, expanded security features, and updated <b>Task</b> <b>Manager</b> were still positive improvements for the operating system. Bright also said that Windows 8's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an [...] "extremely ambitious" [...] aspect of the platform as well, but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple's model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store.|$|E

2500|$|The {{line has}} entered popular {{culture as a}} general metaphor, with uses as diverse as {{descriptions}} of an unresponsive electronic circuit, {{an example of how}} to add an audio file to function as an alert sound in a computer system, and an illustrative quote regarding how to know if one's opponent has been destroyed in an action hero game. USC Literature Professor Henry Jenkins cited Dr. McCoy's [...] "He's dead, Jim" [...] line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities. Google Chrome previously used the phrase as an error message when a process was either terminated with the <b>task</b> <b>manager</b> or ran out of memory, a common error.|$|E
