5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists <b>that</b> <b>store</b> data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill <b>that</b> <b>store</b> solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} cavity forms: a {{mouth that}} {{can usually be}} closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center {{that acts as a}} stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells <b>that</b> <b>store</b> nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} <b>that</b> <b>store</b> lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E

Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils.
