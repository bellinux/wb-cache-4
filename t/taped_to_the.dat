In prior models, the Mac Mini included an AirPort Extreme card <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine board and a separate Bluetooth module. This new Wi-Fi card also no longer uses an MMCX-Female connector for the antenna (as the prior models did) but rather a proprietary Apple one.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Force Pararescue and Swedish {{armed forces}} combat medics utilize lollipops with fentanyl. Navy corpsmen {{working with the}} United States Marine Corps in Afghanistan use Fentanyl lollipops on combat {{casualties}} from IED blasts and other mechanisms of injury. The lollipop is <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> casualty's finger and inserted in between the teeth and cheek (buccal area) of the patient. When enough of the medication has been absorbed the finger will generally fall from the patient's mouth, thereby indicating that the medication has become effectively administered.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of celluloid, which he then <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled {{unanimously}} (8 to 0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who {{had recently been}} appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered <b>the</b> President <b>to</b> release <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special prosecutor.

25|$|It is {{typically}} constructed from a short piece or tuft of yarn {{placed in the}} free air stream where it is visible to the pilot. In closed cockpit aircraft, it is usually <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aircraft canopy. It may also be mounted on the aircraft's nose, either directly on the skin, or elevated on a mast, in which case {{it may also be}} fitted with a small paper cone at the trailing end. They are commonly used on gliders, but may also be found on jet aircraft (especially fighters), ultralight aircraft, light-sport aircraft, autogyros, airplanes and helicopters. Its usefulness on airplanes with a tractor configuration (single propeller at the nose) is limited because the propeller creates turbulence and the spiral slipstream displaces the string to one side.|$|E
500|$|The {{post-production}} {{tasks were}} as challenging as the production itself. Sound editors {{had to listen}} to the entire uncut tracks from the recorders <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actors' bodies in order to find the dialogue. Content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to [...] "It's a Small World" [...] and footage from Soarin', was removed from the film to avoid copyright infringement. Composer Abel Korzeniowski contributed a light, airy score similar to those used in Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

The {{blueprint for the}} group's major-label debut album, demo tape Rage Against the Machine, was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single match <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as B-sides, while three others never saw an official release. Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with Epic Records. Morello said, [...] "Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they've followed through... We never saw a [...] conflict {{as long as we}} maintained creative control." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, a judge {{agreed that}} the [...] "pink room scene', which shows Rihanna {{dominating}} a {{man in front of}} pink and white striped walls, was very similar to LaChapelle's [...] "Striped Face" [...] photograph; the judge pinpointed a scene where Rihanna is seen against a blue background, wearing pink latex and placing a sweet on her tongue." [...] Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum. After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was [...] "not personal, it's strictly business", and that [...] "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats and there should be no difference when sampling an artist's visuals." [...] In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall with a plastic sheet in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series Paperworld.|$|E
500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ...

500|$|In [...] "The Possum", Ron is {{revealed}} {{to have a}} very large woodshop. This element of Ron's character was inspired by actor Nick Offerman, who in addition to comedy runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop. This was also referenced in the previous second season episode [...] "Sweetums", in which Ron builds a harp from scratch to prove to Leslie he is not intoxicated. During one scene, Leslie shows a list of the Pawnee Parks Department's Most Wanted Pests, which includes several raccoons. This is a reference to a running gag, established from the series, that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem. Shortly after [...] "The Possum" [...] originally aired, a downloadable PDF file was made available on NBC's [...] "City of Pawnee" [...] website of the most wanted pests list, which included images of the 10 most animals including raccoons, the opossum, a bat, a feral cat and a crow. The site also included a PDF file of {{the front page of the}} fictional newspaper's The Pawnee Journal, which included the newspaper article referenced in the episode about Andy's capture of the opossum. A printed copy of the newspaper article can be seen <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall of Andy's shoeshine stand in the subsequent episode, [...] "Park Safety".|$|E
500|$|As {{the video}} opens, Rihanna is dragged into a press conference, {{where she is}} covered {{with plastic wrap and}} taped to a wall. Microphones and gagged reporters {{surround}} her. In an outdoor scene, she wears a cream-colored latex dress and leads a gagged Perez Hilton around by a dog leash. Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall of the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex bikini and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body and the wall behind her. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of the singer wearing a feather boa and a tube top with [...] "censored" [...] printed across it. The video then alternates between previous scenes and images in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and jewel-covered ice cream. In the final scene, she lies on a newsroom desk, with a smiley face emblem over one eye and a Rolling Stones tongue logo over her mouth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design was}} based on Zeppelin bomber L-49 (LZ-96), built in 1917. L-49 was a {{lightened}} Type U [...] "height climber", designed for altitude {{at the expense of}} other qualities. The design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer Zeppelins were used, as well as some structural improvements. The structure was built from a new alloy of aluminum and copper known as duralumin. Girders were fabricated at the Naval Aircraft Factory. Whether the changes introduced into the original design of L-49 played a part in Shenandoahs later breakup is a matter of debate. An outer cover of high-quality cotton cloth was sewn, laced or <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> duralumin frame and painted with aluminum dope.|$|E

2500|$|It {{consists}} of a brief electrical stimulation of the nerve in one point underneath the skin, {{and at the same}} time recording the electrical activity (compound action potentials) at another point of the nerve's trajectory in the body. [...] The response is displayed in a cathode ray tube (CRT) or through the video monitor of a computer. [...] The stimulation as well as the recording are carried out by disc electrodes <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin, and the technician may use electrically conducting gel or paste to bolster the signals being input and output. [...] Alternatively, the recording electrodes may also be used to pick up the electrical activity of a muscle innervated by that nerve. [...] In such instances electroneuronography is closely related to electromyography.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, the Scissor Girls {{became friends}} with a Copy Max {{employee}} named Kelly Kuvo—at the time also {{a student at the}} Art Institute of Chicago—who worked in the Wicker Park district of Chicago, a breeding ground for No Wave bands during the early 1990s. Kuvo offered the band a chance to make their first Scissor Girls fliers, demo tape inserts, and posters free of charge, giving the band a boost of publicity which they were able to exploit well enough to land their first gig: a local performance that took place on Halloween night 1992. Also in 1992, the band began to record their first 7-inch, Phy, Diablo!, issuing the release on Chicago indie label Monkeytech. The album sleeve of each release included a real dried cricket smashed and <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cover.

Straight to Hell also featured London-Irish folk/punk band the Pogues, both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist Philip Chevron, who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: [...] "When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon {{and he was on}} tour in the USA as deputy guitarist the next day.
