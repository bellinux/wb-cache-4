5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. The mural {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. <b>The</b> <b>Apple</b> Birds and The Return of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. <b>The</b> <b>Apple</b> Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> A7 processor and <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> A8X processor, <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, 1832, {{between two}} attacks that {{occurred}} at Fort Blue Mounds, {{a party of}} Native Americans crossed over from {{the west side of}} the Mississippi River near Galena.

One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 in the case of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
