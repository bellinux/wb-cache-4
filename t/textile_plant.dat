5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's <b>textile</b> <b>plant</b> in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, {{local investors}} founded the Opelika Cotton Mill {{as the first}} <b>textile</b> <b>plant</b> in the city, {{employing}} 125. The city was located on the Fall Line of the Piedmont, where factories were established {{to take advantage of}} water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925 city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now WestPoint Home) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits. From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Thompson was {{transferred}} to the National Girls Baseball League of Chicago, where she played through the 1950 season. Following her baseball career, she returned to South Carolina and married Claude Griffin in 1954. The couple had two daughters, Claudia and Carol. Thompson went to work as a supervisor in a <b>textile</b> <b>plant</b> and retired in 1984. She did not participate in or even discuss women's baseball publicly again until the Baseball Hall of Fame's AAGPBL tribute exhibit was unveiled at Cooperstown, New York in 1988. After that, she was interviewed by filmmaker Penny Marshall to get a personal account of her own experiences in the league for the 1992 film A League of Their Own, starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty, and Rosie O'Donnell, which brought the AAGPBL into the public eye. Thompson claims that she was disappointed by the way that Tom Hanks portrayed the manager. Originally she was intended to have a speaking part in the film. However this became impossible due to union rules. Instead she served as an adviser for the film and she appears as an unpaid extra. Clips from her playing days appear during the end credits of the movie.|$|E
500|$|When Colt {{returned}} to the United States in 1832, {{he went back to}} work for his father, who financed the production of two guns, a rifle and a pistol. The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired, but the rifle performed well. His father would not finance any further development, so Samuel needed {{to find a way to}} pay for the development of his ideas. He had learned about nitrous oxide (laughing gas) from the factory chemist in his father's <b>textile</b> <b>plant,</b> so he took a portable lab on the road and earned a living performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and Canada, billing himself as [...] "the Celebrated Dr. Coult of New-York, London and Calcutta". Colt conceived of himself as a man of science and thought if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide, he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver. He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums. As ticket sales declined, Colt realized that [...] "serious" [...] museum lectures were not what the people wanted to pay money to see and that it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved. While visiting his brother, John, in Cincinnati, he partnered with sculptor, Hiram Powers, for his demonstrations with a theme based on The Divine Comedy. Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons, centaurs and mummies from Dante. Colt constructed fireworks to complete the show, which was a success. According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson, the [...] "lectures launched Colt's celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue-style pitchman". His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic on board a riverboat by giving his patients a dose of nitrous oxide.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{recording}} and appearing {{on radio and}} in clubs, Thomas continued {{to work as a}} boiler operator in the <b>textile</b> <b>plant,</b> where he claimed the noises sometimes suggested musical rhythms and lyrics to him, before he finally gave up the job in 1963, to focus on his role as a singer and entertainer. [...] He recorded a series of novelty dance tracks, including [...] "Can Your Monkey Do the Dog'" [...] and '"Somebody Stole My Dog" [...] for Stax, where he was often backed by Booker T. & the MGs or the Bar-Kays. [...] He also became a mentor to younger Stax stars, giving advice on stage moves to performers like Otis Redding, who partnered daughter Carla on record.|$|E

Meanwhile, [...] "Rabbit" [...] had successfully escaped, only to shoot a police officer and be returned to San Quentin for execution. Chessman's predicament, along with the execution of [...] "Rabbit," [...] inspired Haggard to change his life. He soon earned a high school equivalency diploma and kept a steady job in the prison's <b>textile</b> <b>plant.</b> He also played for the prison's country music band, attributing a performance by Johnny Cash at the prison on New Year's Day 1959 as his main inspiration to join it.

In 1923, Pinhas Rutenberg was granted an exclusive concession for the production and distribution of electric power. He founded the Palestine Electric Company, later the Israel Electric Corporation.

The Ata <b>textile</b> <b>plant</b> in Kiryat Ata, which went on to become an icon of the Israeli textile industry, was established in 1934. The industry underwent rapid development during World War II, when supplies from Europe were cut off while local manufacturers were commissioned for army needs.
