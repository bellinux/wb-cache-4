5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> they will end up.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains were}} exhumed on October 16, 2013, {{for further study}} and transported to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the body had {{previously}} been examined in 1999. Authorities hoped that by studying the bones, {{they would be able}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the woman had lived prior to her death.|$|E
25|$|After {{the move}} to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often {{extremely}} loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies—such as extensive use of tape delay—to assemble spatial sound pieces that were far removed from earlier compositions such as Saturn. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective playing that incorporated free improvisation. It is often difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> compositions end and improvisations begin.|$|E

25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E
500|$|The Chronicle was put {{together}} about four hundred years after these events. It is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles, {{as well as from}} oral sources such as sagas, but there is no way <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> these lines came from. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} the terms 'British' and 'Welsh' were used interchangeably, as 'Welsh' is the Saxon word meaning 'foreigner', and was applied to all the native Romano-British of the era.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers and {{visitors}} {{agreed with the}} Boston Daily Advertiser that [...] "it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> reality ends and the painting begins." [...] One veteran, pointing at the painting, said to his friend: [...] "You see that puff of smoke? Just wait a moment till that clears away, and I'll show you just where I stood." [...] In New York, police responding to a report of a nighttime burglary and disoriented by the illusion twice seized dummies representing dead soldiers, convinced that they were live burglars.|$|E

You have been around enough to know that there is no secret so precious as the secret of a home. You happened to find mine, and I guess I can trust you not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> anybody <b>where</b> it is. If you can find the homes of Fidget and Weechi, all right, but I certainly don't intend <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>where</b> they are." ...|$|R

500|$|Western Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; {{exemplified}} best {{by that of}} Hindu goddess Sarasvati at the Sarasvati {{temple in}} Gadag city. Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. [...] Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo. From the waist down, the image is dressed in {{what seems to be}} the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the drapery begins and where it ends.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were generally}} praised by critics. GameSpot's Andrew Park stated that virtually {{everything in the}} PC version [...] "looks bright, colorful and clean" [...] when playing in 3D-accelerated mode, but called its texturing minimal. GameSpot's Ben Stahl also called the N64 version's track design [...] "innovative and cute", as well as saying the tracks and backgrounds have a [...] "somewhat real look" [...] {{that makes it easier}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> the player should be driving. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the game's background animations, stating that they not only [...] "add to the atmosphere of the game, but also affect the way it plays". However, some reviewers criticised the game's performance, with IGN's Sam Bishop stating that the PlayStation version's load times between levels are horrendous and Next Generation Chris Charla calling the N64 version's framerate [...] "nauseatingly slow". Conversely, IGN's Winnie Imperio called the N64 version's framerate [...] "consistent, if not entirely smooth".|$|E
500|$|The ported {{version of}} the game {{available}} in Sonic Gems Collection was more negatively reviewed. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell called the game [...] "too awkward to play {{for any length of}} time", 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated [...] "The grainy visuals make it hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> you're going, and the frustrating controls make it difficult to get there," [...] GameSpot's Ryan Davis described [...] "its laughably bad soundtrack" [...] as [...] "the game's only redeeming quality", and GameSpy's Phil Theobald called Sonic R [...] "a concept that works better in theory than in practice"—despite its [...] "fantastic (if not bizarre) soundtrack". In a 2003 retrospective, Game Informer described the game as [...] "decent, but unmemorable", while GamesRadar included Sonic R in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it [...] "a technical tour de force". GameTrailers ranked it as the second worst Sonic game, behind 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller's Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that [...] "the final version of Sonic R is actually quite good... However, I do admit that the base concept of Sonic R, in which a player 'drives' running characters, is not great".|$|E

500|$|Michael Cragg of The Guardian gave a {{positive}} review for {{the video and}} wrote: [...] "Superstars are at their best when they're simultaneously aware and unaware of their own ridiculousness and that's what Marry the Night delivers for Lady Gaga." [...] Daily News Kathryn Kattalia compared Gaga with Madonna in several scenes in the video. Kattalia further praised the dancing during the video, describing it as [...] "her best". However, she criticized the scenes of nudity noting: [...] "The rest of the video is pretty tame by Gaga standards." [...] Spins Marc Hogan wrote that [...] "it's hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> Gaga is winking at us and where she's simply fallen into a foxhole of unrestrained ego." [...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries." [...] Leah Collins of Dose compared Gaga's outfits with Christian Louboutin's designs. She further compared the set in the video to the cover artwork of Born This Way and called it a [...] "very fashionable recreation of Girl, Interrupted." [...] A writer of CNN commented, [...] "Lady Gaga is known for creating evocative mini-movies to provide the visuals for her singles, and 'Marry the Night' is no different." [...] Describing the video as [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "enigmatic", Liz Raftery of People further commened that it [...] "will certainly leave fans talking, if not scratching their heads." [...] An editor of ABC News praised Gaga's [...] "interesting perspective in the video." [...] NMEs Priya Elan wrote that Gaga sounds like [...] "a lobotomized Carrie Bradshaw" [...] during the introduction. He also commented, [...] "It's definitely an improvement on 'Judas', but could it maybe have been snipped a bit to make it shorter?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Koine style (from Greek koinos = [...] "common") is {{the style}} of pottery popular {{in the first three}} {{quarters}} of this era. This form of pottery is thus named for its intense technical and stylistic uniformity, over a large area of the eastern and central Mediterranean. During LH IIIA it is virtually impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> in Mycenaean Greece a specific vase was made. Pottery found on the islands north of Sicily is almost identical to that found in Cyprus and the Levant.|$|E
2500|$|Williamson was subpoenaed by Pennsylvania US District Court judge John K. Kane, whom Wheeler had appealed to, under a writ of {{habeas corpus}} to produce Johnson and her sons. Kane had {{rejected}} as [...] "immaterial and irrelevant" [...] an affidavit from Johnson saying {{she had not been}} forcibly abducted. When Williamson refused <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> Johnson was being hidden (as he did not know since Still had taken her away), Kane charged him with contempt of court and sentenced him to 90 days in jail. They had a history of confrontation over slavery issues.|$|E
2500|$|A Chinook’s birthplace {{and later}} {{evolution}} can be tracked {{by looking at}} its otolith (ear) bone. The bone can record the chemical composition of the water the fish had lived in just like a tree’s growth rings provide hints on dry and wet years. [...] The bone is built with the chemical signature of the environment that hosted the fish. Researchers were able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>where</b> different individuals of Chinook were born and lived {{in the first year}} of their lives. [...] Testing was done by measuring the strontium in the bones. [...] Strontium can accurately show researchers the exact location and time of a fish swimming in a river.|$|E

2500|$|Rosenberg {{talked about}} the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go [...] "even further in all our storytelling" [...] than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the Alias comic: [...] "That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [...] There's no pilot and then getting feedback, {{reaction}} and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's the story you want <b>to</b> <b>tell?</b> <b>Where</b> {{do you want to}} go with ?" [...] Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that [...] "we start off with [...] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn’t as well known in the universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it’s free pass". Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different to the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.|$|E
