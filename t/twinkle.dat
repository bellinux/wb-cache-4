40|$|BackgroundThe color Doppler <b>twinkling</b> {{artifact}} {{is manifested}} as {{a rapidly changing}} mixture of red and blue colors behind a strongly reflecting structure. The effects of the roughness of the reflecting surface and the Doppler angle on {{the intensity of the}} <b>twinkling</b> artifact have never been quantitatively reported before. In this study, a simple in vitro system with reproducible results was established to observe the effects of these two factors on the strength of the <b>twinkling</b> artifact. Materials and MethodsSix different grits of water sandpapers were simultaneously scanned in a water bath with a fixed probe. In part 1, the computer calculated the pixels of color Doppler <b>twinkling</b> artifact behind each water sandpaper. In part 2, the signals of <b>twinkling</b> artifacts with different sandpaper sizes and different Doppler angles were recorded and analyzed. ResultsIn part 1, the <b>twinkling</b> artifact was identified persistently and more intensely behind water sandpapers that had greater surface roughness. In part 2, different Doppler angles revealed less obvious effects on the strength of the <b>twinkling</b> artifacts in a certain range of angles, but would drastically decrease the intensity in the steeper angles. ConclusionsWe have established a simple model system with water sandpapers for the evaluation of the <b>twinkling</b> artifact. Our data confirmed the assumption that the roughness of the reflecting surface {{is directly related to the}} strength of the <b>twinkling</b> artifact. In addition, the Doppler angle affects the intensity of the artifact, but only in the steeper angles...|$|R

5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that <b>twinkle</b> because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhysiological {{alterations}} in cortical neurons are induced during adaptation to an artificial scotoma, a small homogeneous patch within a dynamic random noise or patterned background. When the dynamic noise {{is replaced by}} an equiluminant gray background, a <b>twinkling</b> aftereffect {{can be seen in}} the location of the artificial scotoma. Following binocular adaptation, we discovered that the perceived size of the <b>twinkling</b> aftereffect was dramatically smaller than the inducing artificial scotoma. Dichoptic adaptation induced shrinkage in the <b>twinkling</b> aftereffect that was similar to that found after binocular adaptation, suggesting that the <b>twinkling</b> aftereffect and its shrinkage both have cortical origins. We speculate that this perceptual shrinkage may reflect the interaction between two cortical mechanisms: a <b>twinkling</b> aftereffect mechanism that spreads throughout the artificial scotoma, and a filling-in mechanism that has a greater influence at the edges of the artificial scotoma and spreads inwards...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} literature, the <b>twinkling</b> sign {{can also be}} {{associated}} with vascular and/or parenchymal calcifications [17, 18]. It is possible to differentiate between these entities: when the <b>twinkling</b> sign is produced by vascular calcifications, it appears near a structure {{that at the same}} time produces a pulsing color signal due to the blood flow [19 – 22]. When the <b>twinkling</b> sign is produced by intraparenchymal calcifications, it differs from lithiasis due to its parenchymal location [23 – 25].|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the color-Doppler must be {{accurate}} and rigorous {{in order to}} identify the <b>twinkling</b> sign, aiming at finding a scanning plan in which the ultrasound beam is exactly perpendicular to the lithiasis. Only in this specific case does the lithiasis produce the <b>twinkling</b> sign. Identifying the <b>twinkling</b> sign is therefore much more difficult in color-Doppler because for these lithiasis, there are no grey-scale parameters that might raise some doubts and lead the physician to focus on a certain area of the kidney on color-Doppler. False negatives (29 out of 206) on the <b>twinkling</b> signs could be produced by the interference of obesity, intestinal meteorism and lack of cooperation by the patient with the ultrasound technique.|$|R

30|$|Colour Doppler <b>twinkling</b> {{artefact}} [15, 26, 27]. This artefact is {{a mixture}} of red and blue pixels on colour Doppler secondary to the “noise” produced from rough interfaces composed of sparse reflectors such as urinary stones. It is very useful to confirm findings of grey-scale, especially in doubtful cases due to small size of the stone [22] or located in difficult-to-visualise ureteral portions [27]. In the study by Moore et al. [15], the sensitivity of US improved from 47.6 to 86  % when the <b>twinkling</b> sign was used. In the recent study by Ripolles et al., [27] which analysed the specific value of the <b>twinkling</b> artefact, the sensitivity of US using the <b>twinkling</b> artefact for detecting lithiasis was 90  % and the specificity 100  %. A total of 78  % of the lithiases showed the <b>twinkling</b> artefact, including three stones not identified by B-mode US, and in 68  % of these stones, the artefact was detected before the stone itself with B-mode.|$|R
40|$|The color Doppler <b>twinkling</b> {{artifact}} manifests as {{a rapidly}} changing mixture of red and blue colors behind strongly reflective structures. The <b>twinkling</b> artifact occurs behind diseased cardiac valves, although the phenomenon is not well described. This study sought to determine {{the presence of the}} color Doppler <b>twinkling</b> artifact in calcified cardiac valves in vitro using soft tissue radiography for reference. Seventeen specimens of diseased cardiac valves from patients undergoing valve replacement surgery were studied. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the detection of calcifications using the presence of the <b>twinkling</b> artifact were 66. 7 % and 81. 8 %, respectively. If valves with only microcalcifications or smooth calcifications were eliminated from the analysis, all (100 %) of the three valves with irregular macrocalcifications exhibited the <b>twinkling</b> artifact. It is important to recognize this artifact because it may lead to misdiagnosis of vascular flow in echocardiography.

30|$|In conclusion, the <b>twinkling</b> sign {{showed the}} highest {{sensitivity}} {{in the case}} of certain or doubtful diagnosis of renal lithiasis on grey-scale.

40|$|Purpose: Greater visual {{contrast}} between calculi and tissue would improve ultrasound (US) imaging of urolithiasis and potentially expand clinical use. The color Doppler <b>twinkling</b> artifact {{has been suggested}} to provide enhanced contrast of stones compared with brightness mode (B-mode) imaging, but results are variable. This work provides the first quantitative measure of stone contrast in humans for B-mode and color Doppler mode, forming the basis to improve US {{for the detection of}} stones. Materials and Methods: Using a research ultrasound system, B-mode imaging was tuned for detecting stones by applying a single transmit angle and reduced signal compression. Stone <b>twinkling</b> with color Doppler was tuned by using low-frequency transmit pulses, longer pulse durations, and a high-pulse repetition frequency. Data were captured from 32 subjects, with 297 B-mode and Doppler images analyzed from 21 subjects exhibiting <b>twinkling</b> signals. The signal to clutter ratio (i. e., stone to background tissue) (SCR) was used to compare the contrast of a stone on B-mode with color Doppler, and the {{contrast between}} stone <b>twinkling</b> and blood-flow signals within the kidney. Results: The stone was the brightest object in only 54 % of B-mode images and 100 % of Doppler images containing stone <b>twinkling.</b> On average, stones were isoechoic with the tissue clutter on B-mode (SCR[*]=[*] 0 [*]dB). Stone <b>twinkling</b> averaged 37 times greater contrast than B-mode (16 [*]dB, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and 3. 5 times greater contrast than blood-flow signals (5. 5 [*]dB, p[*]=[*] 0. 088). Conclusions: This study provides the first quantitative measure of US stone to tissue contrast in humans. Stone <b>twinkling</b> contrast is significantly greater than the contrast of a stone on B-mode. There was also a trend of stone <b>twinkling</b> signals having greater contrast than blood-flow signals in the kidney. Dedicated optimization of B-mode and color Doppler stone imaging could improve US detection of stones...|$|R
