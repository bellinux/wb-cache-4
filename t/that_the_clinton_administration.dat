2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill Clinton {{did not have a}} {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since leaving Congress in 2003, Barr {{has become}} a vocal {{opponent}} of the Patriot Act and has stated that he voted for it reluctantly and regrets voting for it, only agreeing because the Bush administration promised not to attempt to expand the granted powers or use them for non-terrorism purposes, and the administration agreed to report to Congress on their usage. Barr says that the Bush administration promptly ignored these three promises given to Congress and has used the powers granted from the Patriot Act to further erode {{due process of law}} even in matters unrelated to terrorism. Barr claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> did much of the same thing. In 2005– the year the Patriot Act was due for renewal– Barr helped found an organization called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, a bipartisan group dedicated to eliminating aspects of the Patriot Act that could potentially affect law-abiding citizens rather than terrorists, and to [...] "restore traditional checks and balances on government power so the country can effectively fight terror without sacrificing the rights of innocent Americans, rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution."

2500|$|Roy E.

The article will then evaluate the extent to which Obama has attempted to &# 039;adjust&# 039; the nuclear option with the release of the Congressionally mandated Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). Indeed, while he has struck bold rhetorical notes and promises in relation to limiting the role of nuclear weapons, he has stopped short of changing the status quo.

50|$|The {{revelation of}} this program caused a {{widespread}} controversy, with legal experts and politicians concluding that it violates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other legal experts saying that the FISA law only applied to domestic calls and not to overseas calls and communications that involved a foreign intelligence threat.

40|$|Much {{discussion}} {{has been introduced}} about where the role of American foreign policy and ideological thinking will fit {{in the realm of}} the international domain in the 21 st century. Since the end of the Cold War, the concrete notion of an enemy is no longer there and <b>the</b> realist thought <b>that</b> dominated American foreign policy for some forty years is now seemingly giving way to liberalist ideology. Critics have therefore described the end of the Cold War as the triumph of democratic liberalist ideas. However, the end of the Cold War is not a viable reason to assume that realist thinking then is completely replaced by liberalist thinking. Subscribing to accept one sole theory to explain, “why states act they way they do” is not a conducive means for the current study of international relations. Thus, the thesis examines the argument of a blend of realist and liberalist elements in foreign policymaking by highlighting the key merits of realism and liberalism and examining the formulation of American foreign policy and foreign policy in general. To further support the blend of realist and liberalist elements is a brief investigation of U. S. foreign policy before the 1990 ’s and afterwards to demonstrate <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> initiated liberal programs, realist motives for liberalist ideals are prominent in Clinton’s policies directed towards the Baltic States. The Joint Baltic American National Committee and the Northern Europe Initiative policy further solidify this notion of realist motives for liberalist ideals. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|How {{often have}} statesmen been {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} improve the world, and ended up making it worse? And how often have they sought one goal, and ended up by achieving something they neither expected nor desired?” Hans J. Morgenthau (1993 : 6) With no peer competitor in sight, the United States is more powerful than any other nation state in modern history. The U. S. has substantial interests throughout the globe and its government seems to aim at remaining the sole superpower. The last five years have spurred a debate on the nature and purpose of this power and how best to make use of it. In the debates of the 2000 Presidential campaign, the then Governor Bush made a point of second-guessing former Vice President Al Gore’s agenda of active American involvement in a number of cases of conflict resolution abroad. To underline his point, Bush used the phrase “I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders” in a derogative manner. The Republican foreign policy agenda was significantly more isolationist than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> Democratic <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration.</b> Six years later, in George W. Bush’s second term as United States President, Republican foreign policy has taken on a large-scale war on terrorism and intervened in Afghanistan and Iraq, operations that would be seen as inconceivable a few years ago. Coercive democratization has since become the hallmark of the Bush Presidency. Which underlying mechanisms have caused this shift from the course of 2000 to new course of 2006 ? This thesis intends to examine how the theoretical bases of realism and idealism have guided the current Bush administration to choose the promotion of democracy over containment and deterrence. Most particularly, these shifts in policy lead the U. S. to attack Iraq, and to this date, express no intention of leaving in the near future...|$|R
