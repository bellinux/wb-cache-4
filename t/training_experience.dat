5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited <b>training,</b> <b>experience</b> and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique <b>training</b> <b>experience</b> as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E

5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited <b>training,</b> <b>experience</b> and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E

Collocated AAR presents novel challenges for MR, such as collocating time, interactions, and visualizations of previous and current experiences. We created a collocated AAR system for anesthesia education, the Augmented Anesthesia Machine Visualization and Interactive Debriefing system (AAMVID). The system was evaluated in two studies by students (n= 19) and educators (n= 3). The results demonstrate how collocated AAR systems such as AAMVID can: (1) effectively direct student attention and interaction during AAR and (2) provide novel visualizations of aggregate student performance and insight into student understanding for educators...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a survey conducted in an attempt to examine evaluators’ perceptions of the contributions that different educational experiences make to the development of their evaluation skill sets. Self-identified new and graduate student evaluators were asked to describe their evaluation <b>training</b> <b>experiences</b> and to indicate how important each experience was to the development of particular evaluation competencies. A paired-comparison analysis was conducted to determine the scaling of the contribution each educational experience made to the development of each competency.

25|$|Hidalgo was {{met with}} an outpouring of support. Intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people {{followed}} Hidalgo {{with a great deal}} of enthusiasm. Hidalgo permitted Indians and mestizos to join his war in such numbers that the original motives of the Querétaro group were obscured. Allende was Hidalgo's co-conspirator in Querétaro and remained more loyal to the Querétaro group's original, more creole objectives. However, Hidalgo's actions and the people's response, meant he would lead and not Allende. Allende had acquired military training when Mexico established a colonial militia; Hidalgo had no military training at all. The people who followed Hidalgo also had no military <b>training,</b> <b>experience</b> or equipment. Many of these people were poor who were angry after many years of hunger and oppression. Consequently, Hidalgo was the leader of undisciplined rebels.|$|E
25|$|A {{key issue}} {{that remains is}} the lack of female {{representation}} in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is {{due to the lack of}} commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children. While the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. However, uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labour market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of <b>training,</b> <b>experience,</b> and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.|$|E
