500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but I think I can do better." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{graduated}} in 1960 {{and became a}} research student in the university's Mond Laboratory on the old Cavendish site, where he was supervised by Brian Pippard. American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, {{spent a year in}} Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was [...] "a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I can assure you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> class." [...] It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non-linear conduction in superconductors.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the DFV {{was used in the}} BT49, it weighed roughly [...] and {{produced}} around [...] at about 11,000revolutions per minute (rpm). Peak torque was [...] at 9,000rpm. After his first test session with the car, Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet commented that he had always believed [...] "that the DFV was quite a rough, coarse engine, but it felt quite the opposite <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>After</b> those Alfa V12s it felt smooth and willing to rev." [...] In 1979, when the BT49 first raced, all but three teams - Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Renault - used the DFV, and the most powerful alternative (Alfa Romeo's V12) produced [...] By 1982, most teams still used the DFV, but BMW, Ferrari and Hart had joined Renault in employing turbocharged engines: Ferrari's 1982 turbocharged V6 engine produced around , while the DFV's output had remained at around 500bhp.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?" ...|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a blur <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1965 {{he moved}} for £7,000 to Carlisle United {{who had just}} been {{promoted}} to the second tier of English football {{for the first time in}} their history. As Balderstone later said, [...] "They gave me a bit of stick at first because I wasn't the quickest player or the hardest tackler. I used to think I made up for it with speed of thought and control of the ball. I always had confidence in my ability and I knew there'd be somebody in the crowd who appreciated a bit of skill. I won them over and they were very good <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went to the}} stable-gate {{and looked}} out. Then he gave a little whistle <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come <b>after</b> him. And we started out to find the city.|$|R

2500|$|I {{got a job}} on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a {{week for}} myself, my horse, {{and the man who}} looked after it. I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I {{must work}} my way myself. I know that very well; I only want a chance to. In consenting <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>after</b> {{what he told}} you, you almost seem <b>to</b> be giving <b>me</b> a chance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{is n't the}} reason, I know. You nodded <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>after</b> she 'd freed her mind, and {{you meant}} to go then. Come, now, what is it?" ...|$|E
