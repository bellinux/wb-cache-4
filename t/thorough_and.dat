5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not <b>thorough,</b> <b>and</b> that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual {{formations}}. These formations include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his preferred set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely <b>thorough</b> <b>and</b> meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a <b>thorough</b> <b>and</b> important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E

5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an in-depth study of the foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a <b>thorough</b> <b>and</b> complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E
