500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
