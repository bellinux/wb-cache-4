40|$|ABSTRACT: David Armstrong {{believes}} in universals. Once universals are accepted, {{it must also}} be accepted that they resemble one another to various degrees. Colors, for instance, fall into a complicated multidimensional resemblance-order. Armstrong claims that all universals are complex universals, and that they resemble one another insofar as they have common universal constituents. Armstrong’s reductive account of resemblance in terms of overlap (or “partial identity”) is attractive because it explains the formal features of resemblance as special cases of the formal properties of overlap. However, David Lewis has pointed out that <b>the</b> composition of <b>universals</b> does not obey the mereological principle of uniqueness. I use Lewis’s point to construct a proof that Armstrong’s analysis is mistaken. It is now generally recognized that <b>the</b> <b>Universals</b> theory and <b>the</b> Trope theory are the leading solutions to the Problem of Natural Classes (or as it is traditionally called, <b>the</b> Problem of <b>Universals).</b> A great advantage of <b>the</b> <b>Universals</b> theory over <b>the</b> Trope Theory is that it promises to analyze all resemblance in terms of partial identity whereas the Trope theory must take resemblance as primitive and leave its formal properties unexplained. By showing that <b>the</b> <b>Universals</b> theory cannot deliver on this promise, my argument weakens the case for rejecting the Trope theory in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Universals</b> theory...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{search for}} <b>universals</b> is a {{tendency}} {{which is based in}} the structure of human knowledge and which correlates with a complementary search for individual properties. <b>The</b> recurrence to <b>universals</b> is inherent in both classificatory and deductive knowledge. Admittingly, the attempt to classify <b>the</b> definitorial <b>universals</b> of human language hierarchically meets various difficulties. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>universals</b> of <b>the</b> formal systems of logic and mathematics, <b>the</b> <b>universals</b> of human language are of a heterogeneous character. Often the relation among <b>the</b> <b>universals</b> of language is not to be determined merely as a relation of logical compatibility or implication, but, additionally, as a relation of means and end. Not everything which is logically possible according to certain basic universals of language is also realized by the languages. Beyond the logical possibilities linguistics must recognize structural, perceptual and cognitive restrictions. – <b>Universal</b> properties have <b>the</b> merit that they are, presumably, more fundamental in the language system than the mere particular properties. – One of the important discoveries of the more recent investigation in language universals is that diversities, in particular certain types of interlingual inversions and gradual distinctions {{in the development of a}} dimension, are also subject to universal laws. – As a motive for research in language universals, which is also a motive for the opposed inquiry in linguistic relativity, one must ultimately consider a psycho-sociological factor. According to the level at which one seeks identification with a gruppe (ethnocentric or anthropocentric) one will be more likely to advocate a constrative linguistics (in the broadest sense of the term) or a universal linguistics...|$|R

5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} starts with <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to}} the solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
