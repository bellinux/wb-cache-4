5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> memory.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> defending against parasites and {{play a role in}} allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{initiating}} body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E

5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|Threatened by {{habitat loss}} and hunting, ruffed lemurs are facing {{extinction}} in the wild. However, they reproduce readily in captivity, {{and have been}} gradually re-introduced into the wild since 1997. Organizations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> ruffed lemur conservation include the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG), Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary in South Africa, Wildlife Trust, and the Duke Lemur Center (DLC).|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will {{be present in the}} same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

25|$|Findings {{have also}} shown monoamine oxidase A {{to affect the}} {{predictive}} ability of the PCL-R. Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and are, therefore, capable of influencing feelings, mood, and behavior in individuals.
