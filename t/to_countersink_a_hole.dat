50|$|These {{tools are}} best used as {{deburring}} tools, where the burr {{from a previous}} machining operation needs to be removed for cosmetic and safety reasons, however they {{may be used in}} softer materials (such as wood or plastic) <b>to</b> create <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole</b> for <b>a</b> screw.|$|R
50|$|Whether manual or automatic, the {{processing}} of tapping begins with forming (usually by drilling) and slightly <b>countersinking</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diameter somewhat smaller than the tap's major diameter. The correct hole diameter may be determined by consulting a drill and tap size chart, a standard reference item found in many machine shops. If the hole is to be drilled, the proper diameter is called the tap drill size.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>countersink</b> is <b>a</b> conical <b>hole</b> {{cut into}} <b>a</b> {{manufactured}} object; <b>a</b> <b>countersink</b> bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such <b>a</b> <b>hole.</b> <b>A</b> common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the <b>countersunk</b> hole, <b>to</b> sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes <b>a</b> flat-bottomed <b>hole</b> that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) <b>A</b> <b>countersink</b> may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|R
5000|$|The tool used {{to drive}} a slotted screw head is called a standard, common blade, flat-blade, slot-head, straight, flat, flat-tip, or [...] "{{flat-head}}" [...] screwdriver. This last usage can be confusing, because the term flat-head also describes a screw with a flat top, designed <b>to</b> install in <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole.</b> Furthermore, the term implies that a screwdriver has a [...] "head"; it does not. Such a flat-headed screw may have a slotted, cross, square recessed, or combination head. Prior {{to the development of}} the newer bit types the flat-blade was referred to as the [...] "Common-Blade". This was simply because it was the most common one.|$|R
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> <b>countersink.</b> The advantage <b>to</b> this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas a {{counterbore}} is a flat-bottomed enlargement of <b>a</b> smaller coaxial <b>hole,</b> <b>a</b> <b>countersink</b> is <b>a</b> conical enlargement of such. A spotface often {{takes the form}} of a very shallow counterbore.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>countersink</b> (symbol: ⌵) is <b>a</b> conical <b>hole</b> {{cut into}} <b>a</b> {{manufactured}} object, or the cutter used to cut such <b>a</b> <b>hole.</b> <b>A</b> common use {{is to allow}} the head of <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> bolt or screw, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of}} the surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes <b>a</b> flat-bottomed <b>hole</b> that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). <b>A</b> <b>countersink</b> may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.|$|R
40|$|Bolted joints {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} industry but often represent a critical area of initiation of damage, especially on composite parts. End-life inspections performed on several aircraft, found multiple instances of delamination damage initiation around the bolt holes of pin-loaded joints on carbon/epoxy composite structural panels. To investigate the severity of such damage and {{the conditions in which}} it can bring to dangerous failure, a research program will perform single and double-lap bolted joints tests using special composite specimen in which controlled and consistent delamination has been introduced around the hole location. At present time, however, there is no standard procedure to safely introduce such damage in a composite specimen. This thesis presents a research program with the aim of defining the best method to introduce a controlled and consistent delamination damage on a carbon/epoxy composite specimen with <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole.</b> Several methods have been proposed and analyzed in detail using Finite Element simulations and experimental activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole</b> and <b>a</b> shank portion which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular cone. A split collar member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to secure the collar halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the split collar by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the shank tapered portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|R

50|$|A {{flush rivet}} is used {{primarily}} on external metal surfaces where good appearance and {{the elimination of}} unnecessary aerodynamic drag are important. A flush rivet takes advantage of <b>a</b> <b>countersink</b> hole; they are also commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>countersunk</b> rivets. Countersunk or flush rivets are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons as it not allow to raise the drag while installed. Additional post-installation machining may be performed to perfect the airflow.|$|R
50|$|The non-conducting spigot of the {{original}} 605 plug was provided with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> for <b>a</b> <b>countersunk</b> screw, allowing the plug to be fixed in a wall-mounted socket. Removal then required first removing the socket cover, to allow this retaining screw to be removed. In this way a semi-permanent connection, requiring tools for disconnection, could be achieved.|$|R
5000|$|A Dan Martin Style [...] "zero flute" [...] <b>countersink</b> is <b>a</b> {{cone-shaped}} tool with {{a cutting}} edge provided by <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> that goes through {{the side of the}} cone. The intersection of the hole and cone form the cutting edge on the tool. The cone is not truly symmetrical as it is essential that the cone retreats away from the cutting edge as the tool rotates providing clearance. If this does not occur the cutting edge will lack clearance and rub rather than bite into the material. This clearance is referred to as cutting relief.|$|R
50|$|Center drill is A two-fluted tool {{consisting}} of a twist drill with a 60° countersink; used <b>to</b> drill <b>countersink</b> center <b>holes</b> in <b>a</b> work piece to be mounted between centers for turning or grinding.|$|R

25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with <b>a</b> <b>countersink</b> cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|R

5000|$|Another similar skim coating {{is always}} {{done in a}} process called veneer plastering, {{although}} it is done slightly thicker (about 2 mm or 1/8 inch). Veneering uses a slightly different specialized setting compound ("finish plaster") that contains gypsum and lime putty. This application uses blueboard, which has special treated paper to accelerate {{the setting of the}} gypsum plaster component. This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used <b>to</b> <b>countersink</b> the tape in taped jointing whereas the tape in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface. One coat veneer plaster over dry board is an intermediate style step between full multi-coat [...] "wet" [...] plaster and the limited joint-treatment-only given [...] "dry" [...] wall.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> through <b>hole,</b> also {{thru-hole}} or clearance <b>hole,</b> {{refers to}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through {{the material of}} an object. In other words, <b>a</b> through <b>hole</b> is <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> that {{goes all the way}} through something.

It is used in <b>a</b> drill. <b>Hole</b> saws typically have a pilot drill bit at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> saw creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist drills or spade drills for relatively large holes (especially those larger than 25 mm). The same hole can be made faster and using less power.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Presentation date: 2001 - 06 - 01 Twenty-one {{countersunk}} culverts in Oregon were inventoried {{to establish}} baseline {{information for the}} stream crossings so that subsequent resurveys can assess the long-term stability and functionality of the culvert design. A subset of the inventoried culverts was selected for detailed hydraulic measurements. The detailed velocity measurements were used to help derive an empirical model, which will calculate the proportion of a cross-section that is {{less than or equal}} to a particular velocity. The model could be used in the design stages of <b>countersunk</b> culvert installations <b>to</b> determine what proportion of the culvert cross-section will be within a swimming velocity of a fish species and age class of interest at a specific fish passage design discharge. Natural channel roughness equations were examined for application <b>to</b> <b>countersunk</b> culverts, which is a stream simulation design. A weighting factor to account for corrugation roughness along the sides of the culvert is proposed. The roughness equations corresponded well with back-calculated roughness values...|$|R
