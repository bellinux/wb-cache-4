5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} apart by civilians {{who used the}} {{materials}} <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E
5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> confidence without worrying about the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E

German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{writes a}} new Age called Releeshahn for the D'ni {{survivors}} <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> civilization {{as he and}} Catherine settle back on Earth, raising a daughter named Yeesha. As Atrus prepares to take the Stranger to Releeshahn, a mysterious man named Saavedro appears and steals the Releeshahn Descriptive Book. The Stranger follows Saavedro through several Ages (which were used to train Sirrus and Achenar {{in the art of}} writing Ages), before finally recovering the book. Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger's help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; the Stranger saves Yeesha from Sirrus' machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed. D'ni is not fully restored until the creatures the D'ni enslaved, known as the Bahro, are freed.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired.

The scheme involved up to 2,500 refugees who would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> homes, funded by the Austrian government.

Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his own citizens, and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E

5|$|Sentinel {{uses the}} Pillars to {{transport}} hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Gould, who is {{revealed to be}} in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Megatron's second-in-command, Starscream, seemingly killing the Autobots.

Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, as most {{of their}} air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> air defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.|$|E

The Protoss attempt <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> lives on Shakuras, but are interrupted by a Zerg raid commanded by Sarah Kerrigan that kidnaps the dark templar leader Raszagal.

5|$|The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. To protect these gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports in an effort <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E
