5|$|In 1960, Weinberg was {{appointed}} to the President's Science Advisory Committee in the Eisenhower administration and later served on it in <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration.</b> After leaving the ORNL in 1973, he was named director of the Office of Energy Research and Development in Washington, D.C., in 1974. The following year he founded and became the first director of the Institute for Energy Analysis at Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU).|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E

5|$|The Krulak–Mendenhall {{mission was}} a fact-finding {{expedition}} dispatched by <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> to South Vietnam in early September 1963. The stated {{purpose of the}} expedition {{was to investigate the}} progress of the war by the South Vietnamese regime and its US military advisers against the Viet Cong insurgency. The mission was led by Victor Krulak and Joseph Mendenhall. Krulak was a major general in the United States Marine Corps, while Mendenhall was a senior Foreign Service Officer experienced in dealing with Vietnamese affairs.|$|E
5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale American support began during <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Administration</b> in {{the early}} 1960s, {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of {{helicopters}} changed the nature of the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the Viet Cong. These tactics, combined with the use of armored personnel carriers, took a heavy toll on various fledgling Viet Cong units. The lightly armed Viet Cong had no weaponry capable of stopping the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Administration</b> of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for {{alternative}} leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{determined that}} it did not need to go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra and preferred Hancock's original choice of the TFX as a long-term solution, leading to the Menzies government's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F-111s for US$125 million, enough for two squadrons. The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election. Calwell's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre-campaign promise that it would replace the Canberras as soon as it formed a government. The government's announcement, and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor, likely also benefited the United States; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX, and <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> preferred Menzies' defence policies to the opposition's. The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense. The British government's cancellation of the TSR-2 in April 1965 showed that Australia's decision to not order it was correct.|$|E

5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} he would run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time began thinking about running for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E
5|$|After the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, {{civil unrest}} {{broke out in}} South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm after defying a {{government}} ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice {{for the families of}} the victims. With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Diệm's policies. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu conducted the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumours of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>administration</b> sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.|$|E

25|$|By 1961, the United States {{government}} had become {{concerned about the}} Indonesian military's purchase of Soviet weapons and equipment for a planned invasion of West New Guinea. <b>The</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Administration</b> feared an Indonesian drift towards Communism and wanted to court Sukarno away from the Soviet Bloc and Communist China. The United States government also wanted to repair relations with Jakarta, which had deteriorated due to the Eisenhower Administration's covert support for the Permesta/PRRI regional uprisings in Sumatra and Sulawesi.
