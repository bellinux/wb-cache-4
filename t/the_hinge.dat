5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the day B Company was subjected to intense indirect fire on <b>the</b> <b>Hinge,</b> as was C Company on Hill 317. The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> to support B Company. At 20:00 both <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable Chinese counterattack. Heavy mist concealed the Chinese advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7/8 October <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the Chinese in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese swept forward, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire. During one such assault Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's Bren gunners wounded, manned the light machine-gun himself, breaking up a Chinese assault, while controlling the fire of the men around him. Meanwhile, Sergeant R.W. Strong arranged the resupply of ammunition to the forward Australian sections. Both were awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> of {{the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion {{of the shell}}, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. <b>The</b> <b>hinge</b> point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> by a ligament {{composed of two}} keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E

FCL refers to a left-handed window, where <b>the</b> <b>hinges</b> are located on the left and the locking mechanism is on the right. FCR is a right-handed window with <b>the</b> <b>hinges</b> on <b>the</b> right and the locking mechanism on the left. Remember, these definitions apply to a window when looking at it from the exterior. Diagrams of casement windows show a dashed triangle with <b>the</b> <b>hinged</b> side identified by the point of the triangle. FCL windows feature a triangle pointing to the left; FCR windows have a triangle pointing to the right.|$|R
5|$|With {{both sides}} {{exhausted}} from the fighting {{the night of}} 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used {{the opportunity to develop}} their position. To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position, the Sierra feature—a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge—the next day. Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217. The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as <b>the</b> <b>Hinge,</b> would be vital. Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> dominated it from the north. As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest <b>the</b> <b>hinge.</b> The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via <b>the</b> <b>Hinge,</b> and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on <b>the</b> <b>Hinge.</b> Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 <b>the</b> <b>Hinge</b> finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on <b>the</b> <b>Hinge.</b> B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that different types of fibula construction were used contemporaneously. Though the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> was later than the introduction of the spring, the spring remained in use long after <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> was introduced. Therefore, a given fibula with hinge is not necessarily more recent than one with a spring.|$|E

25|$|The {{conformational}} change most relevant for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal {{region of the}} reactive site loop (circled in Figure 4 model B). This region has been termed <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region. The {{conformational change}} within <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region in response to heparin binding results in the expulsion of P14 and P15 from {{the main body of}} the protein and it has been shown that by preventing this conformational change, increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition does not occur. It is thought that the increased flexibility given to the reactive site loop as a result of <b>the</b> <b>hinge</b> region conformational change is a key factor in influencing increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition. It has been calculated that in the absence of the pentasaccharide only one in every 400 Antithrombin molecules (0.25%) is in an active conformation with the P14 and P15 amino acids expelled.|$|E
