In this method, the pit settlement is decomposed into the trend settlement and the stochastic settlement by using Wavelet Analysis {{based on the}} characteristic of influencing factor. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>identifier</b> is established by using artificial neural network (ANN), and trained to approximate the trend settlement. Then, the prediction controller developed could be applied for estimating the actual settlement.

Our primary con-tribution is to describe a family of generative models for NSC that have three key properties: First, they incorporate both sequential and hierarchical structure. Sec-ond, we learn a distributed representation of source code elements. Finally, they integrate closely with a compiler, which allows leveraging compiler logic and ab-stractions when building structure into <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> We also develop an extension that includes more complex structure, refining how <b>the</b> <b>model</b> generates <b>identifier</b> tokens based on what variables are currently in scope.

When stochastic identification is not feasible (no assumptions upon random parameters, single run control, etc), the "worst case" design is required. To avoid this penalty, we propose to extend the Liapunov design technique of building adaptive (on-line) identifiers, so far developed for linear systems with constant parameters. The standard study of stability of an error-equation is replaced by investigating convergence to diagonal set in the Cartesian product of state-parameter spaces of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> and <b>the</b> <b>identifier.</b> We also attempt to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> Conditions for <b>the</b> above are introduced together with proposing suitable Liapunov functions.

Existing solutions applicable for the problem are often ad-hoc for specific query types, or they are inefficient when query results contain large volumes of data to be transferred over the networks. Maintaining model-based views of data streams has been recently highlighted because it permits the data communication over networks to be efficient by transmitting parameter values for <b>the</b> <b>models,</b> instead of sending original data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that employs the advantages of using model-based views for communication-efficient stream data processing over federated sensor networks, yet it significantly improves state-of-the-art approaches.

40|$|Speaker {{and speech}} {{variability}} are {{a challenge in}} speaker and speech recognition. In the context of Malaysian English speakers, the variability is highly complex due to sociolinguistic and cultural background. Past researches focused on vowel classification of Malaysian English on a small dataset with limited number of speakers and text corpus. Among speaker specific characteristics, gender is the most prominent features, which is followed by accents. This project approached the issues of speaker and speech variability in Malaysian English by proposing identifier that combined the gender and accent aspects. This method is fulfilled by training the classifier with gender-dependent data and accent-prone text corpus. The genderaccent database collected is comprised of 120 speakers categorized into four genderaccent groups namely Malay Female (CF), Malay Male (MM), Chinese Female (CF) and Chinese Male (CM). MFCC algorithm is used to extract the features, while GMM is the algorithm used to <b>model</b> <b>the</b> <b>identifier.</b> Findings from the test results show that female and Chinese speakers have higher degree of distinctiveness compared to other accent-gender groups. Chinese female is the best recognized accent-gender group, meanwhile Malay Male is the least recognized, due to codemixing of Malay language and English. Optimum configuration of GMM is also studied across 3 different numbers of Gaussians (12, 24, and 32). It is found that 24 is the most optimal configuration of MFCC-GMM. Meanwhile, it is also known that MFCC-GMM performs better than LPC-KNN on noisy dataset. Overall, the MFCCGMM identifier scored 99. 34 % gender identification rate, 67. 5 % accent identification and 65. 83 % for accent-gender identification task...|$|R

Neural network systems {{belong to}} the class of {{intelligent}} systems and are one of possible variants of adaptive and self-adjusting control systems for complex dynamic objects that can operate under structural, parametric and information uncertainty. These systems are able to control objects of any complexity but have problems with learning and adapting them in real time. Solving these problems is possible {{through the use of}} neural network structures of optimal complexity, implemented in hardware with a high speed, concurrent computing, and replacement of neural network learning procedures with their adjustment. Currently, there is a wide range of hardware implementation of neural network elements in control systems, particularly neurosignal, digital signal and systolic processors, ordered neurochips and PLA structures. Each of them have some advantages and disadvantages that are associated with the cost of implementation, availability of development and programming tools, compatibility with other elements of the system, energy consumption and others. At that point, the most promising tools are PLA structures, that in comparison with other are universal, relatively simple and cheap computing tools, allow organizing parallel computing structures, having great speed and well-designed programming tools. In this paper was developed the concept and methodology of implementation of neural network control system on a hardware platform PLAs, that implement structural elements of adaptive control systems: <b>the</b> object <b>models,</b> controllers, <b>identifiers</b> of states of the object, filters, etc., as well as concurrent computing procedures for these neural elements and the whole system adjustment by using evolutionary optimization technology.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study a graph problem called edge packing in a {{distributed}} setting. An edge packing p {{is a function}} that associates a packing weight p(e) with each edge e of a graph such that {{the sum of the}} weights of the edges incident to each node is at most one. The task is to maximise the total weight of p over all edges. We are interested in approximating a maximum edge packing and in finding maximal edge packings, that is, edge packings such that the weight of no edge can be increased. We use <b>the</b> <b>model</b> of distributed computing known as <b>the</b> LOCAL <b>model.</b> A communication network is modelled as a graph, where nodes correspond to computers and edges correspond to direct communication links. All nodes start {{at the same time and}} they run the same algorithm. Computation proceeds in synchronous communication rounds, during each of which each node can send a message through each of its communication links, receive a message from each of its communication links, and then do unbounded local computation. When a node terminates the algorithm, it must produce a local output – in this case a packing weight for each incident edge. The local outputs of the nodes must together form a feasible global solution. The running time of an algorithm is the number of steps it takes until all nodes have terminated and announced their outputs. In a typical distributed algorithm, the running time of an algorithm is a function of n, the size of the communication graph, and ∆, the maximum degree of the communication graph. In this work we are interested in deterministic algorithms that have a running time that is a function of ∆, but not of n. In this work we will review an O(log ∆) -time constant-approximation algorithm for maximum edge packing, and an O(∆) -time algorithm for maximal edge packing. Maximal edge packing is an example of a problem where the best known algorithm has a running time that is linear-in-∆. Other such problems include maximal matching and (∆ + 1) -colouring. However, few matching lower bounds exist for these problems: by prior work it is known that finding a maximal edge packing requires time Ω(log ∆), leaving an exponential gap between the best known lower and upper bounds. Recently Hirvonen and Suomela (PODC 2012) showed a linear-in-∆ lower bound for maximal matching. This lower bound, however, applies only in weaker, anonymous models of computation. In this work we show a linear-in-∆ lower bound for maximal edge packing. It applies also in the stronger port numbering model with orientation. Recently Göös et al. (PODC 2012) showed that for a large class of optimisation problems, the port numbering with orientation model is as powerful as a stronger, so called unique <b>identifier</b> <b>model.</b> An open question is if this result can applied to extend our lower bound to <b>the</b> unique <b>identifier</b> <b>model...</b>|$|R
