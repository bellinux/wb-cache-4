40|$|NORDSKOG and Crump (1948) com-pared the {{efficiency}} of estimating actual egg production from three methods of periodical trapnesting: (1) Interval day—each trapnest day was spaced at regular intervals throughout the month, (2) Consecutive-day—the trapnest days were taken consecutively, and (3) Ran-dom-day <b>trapnesting.</b> The differences in efficiency among the three methods were so small that the basis for choosing one could be decided entirely upon which was the most convenient to a particular breeder. Poultry breeders today {{recognize the importance of}} selecting for high egg pro-duction on the basis of family and sire-progeny averages. It is clear, therefore, that the accuracy of such group averages is determined not only by the precision of individual records, but also by the num-ber of individual birds on which the group average is based. The relative importance of these two factors as they contribute to the error of a group mean was also con-sidered in the same paper. The results showed that the accuracy lost by trap-nesting on a half-time basis could be re-covered by increasing group size by only 7 percent. The accuracy lost by <b>trapnesting</b> one day per week could be compensated by increasing group size by 25 percent. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show the extent to which progress in breeding fo...|$|E
40|$|THE great {{majority}} of hermaphrodites or sex reversals, hitherto described in domestic fowls, have been in old hens and have usually been associated with disease of the ovary and neoformation of testicular tissue. The present case differs essen-tially in several respects. It occurred in a Rhode Island Red pullet 1 hatched in December 1934. The group to which it belonged began to lay in June 1935, and evidence will be later submitted favouring the view that this fowl was no exception, although, as <b>trapnesting</b> was not employed, of this there is no conclusive proof. In August 1935, it was noticed {{for the first time}} that this pullet differed very markedly from its group members by the possession of a very large, upright, "cocky " comb and wattles. This appearance still persisted in the beginning of September, the "cocky " head furnishings being very much in evidence. The configuration of the body and the colour of the plumage were typically "henny " and spurs were absent. It had never been known to crow and it took no special interest in the other hens. Owing to its age, it was unlikely that it had moulted. No eggs were laid between September ist and October 7 th...|$|E

Romance {{develops}} between Hachi and <b>TRAPNEST's</b> bassist Takumi as well as with the Black Stones' guitarist Nobu. Meanwhile, Nana works hard for her band while trying to find happiness. Both girls struggle through life, and try to keep their friendship from falling apart. More information on the story at Nana.|$|R

40|$|T) REVIOUS {{studies on}} the daily pat-•* • tern of lay of turkeys in floor pens indi-cate a large {{percentage}} of eggs are laid during the afternoon hours (Stockton and Asmundson, 1950; Kosin and Abplanalp, 1951). The latter authors found that the time interval between successive oviposi-tions decreased with increase in size of egg sequence. They further reported that time of day when egg sequences are initi-ated is a good indicator of the laying pat-tern of the hen, since long-sequence layers usually begin their egg sequences early in the morning hours of the day. The usual method of timing oviposi-tions, as reported in the literature, con-sists of checking the <b>trapnests</b> hourly dur-ing the light hours of the work day. No reference is made to ovipositions that may have occurred prior to or after the light period. Since continuous-recording timing devices are now available (Wilson, 1962), time of lay over the entire 24 -hour period can be determined. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the daily time of lay over the 24 -hour period of the day for turkey hens kept in individual wire-floor cages, and 2) to measure with greater accuracy the time lapse between successive eggs in se-quences...|$|R
40|$|THE {{property}} of cottonseed meal when fed to laying hens to produce olive-colored yolks in cold stored eggs was re-ported in 1917, by Lamon and Lee and {{the property to}} produce pink whites by Sher-wood in 1931. The olive color was reported by Heywang, Bird and Altschul (1955) {{to be caused by}} free gossypol, and the pink color was reported by Masson, Vavich, Heywang and Kemmerer (1957), and by Shenstone and Vickery (1959), to be caused by propene ring fatty acids. The observa-tions by Kemmerer, Heywang and Vavich (1961), that sterculic acid enhanced gossy-pol discoloration in eggs indicate, but do not show definitely, that the propene ring fatty acids in cottonseed oil may have the same effect. The work reported in this paper shows definitely that cottonseed oil has an en-hancing effect on the {{property of}} gossypol to cause olive discoloration in cold stored eggs and itself to cause pink coloration. EXPERIMENTAL Nine lots, each containing six White Leghorn hens, were given the same practi-cal laying mash as was used in previously reported work on Sterculia foetida oil (Kemmerer et al., 1961) and water, ad libitum. Each hen was <b>trapnested</b> in order to identify the eggs. Eggs were collected daily from the 4 th day following adminis-tration of gossypol through the 12 th da...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{cholesterol}} {{content of}} infertile and fertile eggs from White Leghorn hens was compared. In Trials 1 and 2, infertile eggs were collected, a male was introduced, and fertile eggs then {{collected from the}} same hens. In Trial 3, two pens of hens were <b>trapnested.</b> The first pen contained hens only, and the second pen contained hens plus a male. After the desired number of eggs were collected from each hen, the male {{was moved to the}} other pen. Twenty-one days were allowed to elapse and eggs were again collected. In Trial 1, there were no statistically significant differences between fertile and infertile eggs in wet yolk weight, dry yolk weight, mg. cholesterol per g. dry yolk, or total yolk cholesterol. In Trial 2, fertile eggs were significantly higher than the infertile eggs in dry yolk weight (P< 0. 05), mg. cholesterol per g. dry yolk (P< 0. 05), and total yolk cholesterol (P< 0. 01). In Trial 3, there were no statistically significant differences between fertile and infertile egg values for any of the egg traits examined. When results were analyzed for differences due to age of hen, wet yolk wt., dry yolk wt. and total cholesterol were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) for eggs laid by the 12. 5 month old hens than for eggs laid by the same hens 11. 0 months old. Cholesterol concentration did not change with the age of the bird. The results from this study show that fertile eggs are not lower in cholesterol content than infertile eggs...|$|R
