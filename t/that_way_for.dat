Between 1960 and 1964 the rifle and mechanised divisions were converted to motor rifle divisions, and reductions in strength began; force size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions by 1970. From 1970 to 1976, three more motor rifle divisions were formed, but one was deactivated in 1977, and the eight motor rifle and three tank division figure remained <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> all subsequent events.|$|E

25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are on the screen, and software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty {{and so they were}} not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if they were not considered ideal, he understood that they had been conceived <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> a reason and so they were unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E

25|$|The Victoria Hotel {{was built}} by Ellen Ryan, one of the Territory’s wealthiest women, who owned land and several mining leases. In 1888 Ryan moved into the Territory hotel trade, lodging a {{successful}} application with the licensing board for a prestigious hotel to be built at 27 Smith Street in central Darwin, then known as Palmerston, during the northern Australia gold rushes of the 1870s onwards. Constructed by H.C. Debross, it was built for £4,000 {{and was the first}} stone building in Darwin. The two-storey hotel was made of local, multi-coloured porcellanite stone, with a facade dominated by a parapetted gable and verandahs. Upon completion, the building dominated Smith Street and remained <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> over half a century.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway.

25|$|On August 20, 1971, the Connie Mack statue was re-dedicated at Veterans Stadium. That same day, {{while an}} evangelical revival group {{was setting up}} its tent, two stepbrothers, aged 9 and 12, sneaked into the park and started a small fire that grew into a 5-alarmer, burning {{through much of the}} {{original}} upper deck, collapsing the roof and leaving twisted steel supports visible from the streets. Ironically, the collapse of the overbloated roof restored much of the balanced grandeur of the original design. The park remained <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> four years, slowly deteriorating and becoming increasingly hazardous. Squatters took up revolving residence, and trash and debris accumulated; small trees took root and flourished, while the once-manicured emerald turf became unruly knee-high stalks. In October 1975, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Ned Hirsh ordered what remained of the stadium razed. The corner tower and its domed cupola, Connie Mack's original office, was the last segment of the ballpark demolished, on July 13, 1976. The demolition on July 13, 1976 was the same day as the 47th MLB All-Star Game played at Veterans Stadium in South Philly.|$|E

After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Culloden, the Prince spent 2 days hiding from the British troops on Raasay {{and as a}} consequence of the island's support for the Jacobite cause the original Raasay House and many dwellings were burnt down by government troops. In conversation with Malcolm MacLeod of Raasay during his short stay on the island the Prince confided that although his life on the run was hard, he would rather live <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> ten years than be captured as he feared assassination. He seemed less aware of the risks his supporters ran. The atrocities perpetrated in the aftermath of Culloden were a shock to him.

500|$|Cosmopolitan {{journalist}} Alex Rees noted how it {{was normal}} for the singer to sound [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "breathless" [...] following four songs in a row on the album discussing sex.

A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C.

Both Christopher R.

Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel". Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how [...] "No Angel" [...] was included in the track listing of Beyoncé, before adding [...] "but it did and we're {{just going to have to}} deal with it".
