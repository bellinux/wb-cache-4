To improve the measurement accuracy of Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters,</b> a phase and frequency matching-based signal processing method for Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> is proposed.

For example, <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> provide a measurement {{of the mass of}} material being transferred through a conduit.

40|$|Coefficients of {{viscosity}} {{of various}} types of gas mixtures, including simulated natural-gas samples, have been measured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature using a modified capillary tube method. Pressure drops across the straight capillary tube section of a <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeter</b> were measured for small, well-defined, volume flow rates for the test gases and for standard air. In this configuration, the flowmeter provides the volumetric flow rates {{as well as a}} well-characterized capillary section for differential pressure measurements across it. The coefficients of viscosity of the test gases were calculated using the reported value of 185. 6 micro P for the viscosity of air. The coefficients of viscosity for the test mixtures were also calculated using Wilke's approximation of the Chapman-Enskog (C-E) theory. The experimental and calculated values for binary mixtures are in agreement within the reported accuracy of Wilke's approximation of the C-E theory.

40|$|Abstract: Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> (CMF) are {{claimed to}} be not {{affected}} by {{the properties of the}} liquid such as heat conductivity, heat capacity and viscosity. They are direct <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> and form a real mean along the flow profile. However, there is some evidence from field applications that the devices, in particular with single straight pipe, suffer under the null drift. Therefore, the zero shift must be adjusted to the properties of liquid, installation site and operating conditions. The zero shift is caused by asymmetry of the oscillating system. A change in the asymmetry leads to the zero shift. This paper presents two methods to determine the zero shift: a sensor and a model based approach. The first uses additional acceleration sensors to measure the vibration of the straight pipe’s mounting. The motion of the mounting represents asymmetries in dissipation. The second method utilizes a model which includes the asymmetries as parameters. These can be detected by auxiliary exitation of the oscillating system...|$|R

40|$|The {{coupling}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> {{and natural}} ventilation {{is important to}} passive building design. <b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> can be classified as external <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> and internal <b>thermal</b> <b>mass.</b> Due to great diurnal variation of ambient air temperature and solar radiation intensity, heat transfer through building envelopes, which is called external <b>thermal</b> <b>mass,</b> is a complex and unsteady process. Indoor furniture are internal <b>thermal</b> <b>mass,</b> affecting the indoor air temperature {{through the process of}} absorbing and releasing heat. In this paper, a heat balance model coupling the external and internal <b>thermal</b> <b>mass,</b> natural ventilation rate and indoor air temperature for naturally ventilated building is developed. In this model, the inner surface temperature of building envelopes is obtained based on the harmonic response method. The effect of external and internal <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> on indoor air temperature for six external walls is discussed of different configurations including lightweight and heavy structures with and without external/internal insulation.

40|$|Abstract. Thermal inertia and <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> are {{concepts}} that oer means to describe trans-port of heat in nonequilibrium uids. However there are options regarding how {{to separate the}} part of the total ow that caries entropy from the ", nonentropy-bearing part. Some hypotheses are examined and compared for constructing such a eld theory of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> in the energy representation. A global intrinsic symmetry and a nite thermal momentum imply that any formulation which hypothesizes a constant ratio of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> to the entropy must tie the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> to the so-called bare mass of particles, to preserve the global conservation of matter. However, in any formulation consistent with the Grad-Boltzmann theory, where must be variable, the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> behaves as a separate variable governed by the entropy and the second law. Nonetheless, in this case has a reasonably broad plateau of values within which entropy {{is a measure of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> associated with changes of state.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> {{can be used}} in {{buildings}} to reduce the need for and dependence on mechanical heating and cooling systems whilst maintaining environmental comfort. Active <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> strategies further enhance the performance of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> through integration with the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. For the design of new buildings to include active <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> strategies, experience from operational projects and design guidelines are normally used by engineers. However, dynamic thermal modelling is required in most cases to accurately determine the performance of its integration with the environmental systems of the building. Design decisions made in the preliminary stages of the design of a building often determine its final thermal characteristics.

40|$|Given {{the pervasiveness}} of energy {{efficiency}} concerns in the built environment, this research aims to answer key questions regarding the performance of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> construction. The work presents the Cube Model, a simplified model of the single-family home. The model combines simplified geometry and equivalent envelope parameters with accurate climate data and internal loading assumptions. The model first addresses the notion as to whether building simplification is a valid means of analysis through a calibration and validation study. Then, the model is used to address three research areas on passive thermal mass: (1) the quantification of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> performance with respect to material thermal properties; (2) the optimization of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> performance for given material parameters; and (3) the sensitivity of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> performance to infiltration and geometry effects. The experiments for wall and slab constructions, to address the first research area, demonstrate that the energy savings from <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> are both climate and season dependent. Results provide the magnitude of energy savings in fifty climates across the United States. Optimization experiments on the material thickness and conductivity, to address the second research area, show that constructions do not reach peak <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> performance at the same thermal properties in all climates. Sensitivity analyses, to address the third research area, indicate that passive <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> and tight construction practices can be mutually optimized without a trade-off of energy performance. Geometry effects demonstrate that modifications in building design can either benefit or hinder the performance of passive <b>thermal</b> <b>mass.</b> The combination of the results suggests that optimum design for <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> performance and the resulting energy consumption are climate-dependent and sensitive to many factors aside from material thermal properties. by Alison C.
