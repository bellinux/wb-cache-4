Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. <b>Transversal</b> division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the <b>transversal</b> of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transversal</b> {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is <b>transversal</b> to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E

Neurosci. 9 : 531. doi: 10. 3389 /fnhum. 2015. 00531 The Poggendorff illusion {{was approached}} {{with a novel}} perspective, that of applying Emmert’s Law to the situation. The extensities between the verticals and the <b>transversals</b> happen to be absolutely equal in retinal image size, whereas the registered distance for the verticals must be smaller {{than that of the}} <b>transversals</b> {{due to the fact that}} the former is assumed to occlude the latter. This combination of facts calls for the operation of Emmert’s Law, which results in the shrinkage of the occluding space between the verticals. Since the retinal image shows the <b>transversals</b> to be in contact with the verticals, the shrinkage must drag the <b>transversals</b> inwards in the cortical representation in order to eliminate the gaps. Such dragging of the <b>transversals</b> produces the illusory misalignment, which is a dictation of geometry.

This result is then applied to the problem of finding μ-way k-homogeneous Latin trades. We generalize this problem to the intersection of μ <b>transversals</b> of B_n such that the <b>transversals</b> intersect stably (that is, the intersection of any pair of <b>transversals</b> is independent of the choice of the pair) and show that these structures can be used to construct μ-way k-homogeneous circulant latin trades of odd order.
