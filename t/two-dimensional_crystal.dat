40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} arranged as <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals</b> in the lipid environment provide close-to-physiological structural information, {{which is}} essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein function. Previously, X-ray diffraction from individual <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals</b> did not represent a suitable investigational tool because of radiation damage. The recent availability of ultrashort pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has now provided a means to outrun the damage. Here, we report on measurements performed at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL on bacteriorhodopsin <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals</b> mounted on a solid support and kept at room temperature. By merging data from about a dozen single crystal diffraction images, we unambiguously identified the diffraction peaks to a resolution of 7 Å, thus improving the observable resolution with respect to that achievable from a single pattern alone. This indicates that a larger dataset will allow for reliable quantification of peak intensities, and in turn a corresponding increase in the resolution.

50|$|Healthy {{individual}} apoptotic {{cells are}} rapidly removed by phagocytes. However, in pathological processes, {{the removal of}} apoptotic cells may be delayed or even absent. Dying cells in tissue can be detected with annexin A5. Labeling of annexin A5 with fluorescent or radioactive molecules {{makes it possible to}} detect binding of labeled annexin A5 to the cell surface of apoptotic cells. After binding to the phospholipid surface, annexin A5 assembles into a trimeric cluster. This trimer consists of three annexin A5 molecules that are bound to each other via non-covalent protein-protein interactions. The formation of annexin A5 trimers results in the formation of a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystal</b> lattice on the phospholipid membrane. This clustering of annexin A5 on the membrane greatly increases the intensity of annexin A5 when labeled with a fluorescent or radioactive probe. <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>crystal</b> formation is believed to cause internalization of annexin A5 through a novel process of endocytosis if it occurs on cells that are in the early phase of executing cell death. Internalization amplifies additionally the intensity of the annexin A5 stained cell.|$|E
50|$|The first girih {{patterns}} {{were made by}} copying a pattern template along a regular grid; the pattern was drawn with compass and straightedge. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of dividers to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to become brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge. Girih patterns made this way are like a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystal,</b> tiling the plane with a unit cell. Because the tiling was done by translation or rotation operations, the unit cells had 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold rotational symmetry.|$|E
5000|$|A {{periodic}} tiling of {{the plane}} is the regular repetition of a [...] "unit cell" [...] (the shape, {{or a group of}} shapes that is repeated) without any gaps. Such tilings {{can be seen as a}} <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystal,</b> and because of the crystallographic restriction theorem, the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. For this reason, it is not possible to tile the plane periodically with figures having five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These shapes with five-fold symmetry repeat periodically, although the space between them contain other shapes that do not have a periodic pattern. Such tilings are called quasi-crystalline tilings.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{isolation}} of graphene in 2004, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals</b> have attracted {{a lot of attention}} in a variety of scientific fields. Thus, Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov were honoured with the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their findings. Ten years later, the interest in materials like graphene and single layer MoS 2 is still growing. In order to actually implement these new materials in the plentitude of applications that are envisaged, new tools are needed.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the structure of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals</b> from preparations of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from beef-heart mitochondria. The crystal structure of these crystals was previously determined to be equivalent with two native enzyme molecules per unit cell, i. e. a p 2 symmetry. However, the optical diffraction patterns of the crystals displayed a clear fourfold symmetry. A Fourier analysis carried out on the calculated diffraction pattern proved unambiguously that the crystal symmetry was p 4212. Following crystallographic rules the unit cell therefore contained eight identical molecules. As a consequence, only a subcomplex of the enzyme rather than the intact enzyme formed the crystal. Electron microscopy of isolated, single molecules of the iron-sulphur protein, a dissociation product of complex I, revealed the presence of square complexes with sides of approximately 15 nm. Since these complexes were indistinguishable from the building blocks (unit cells) of the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>crystals,</b> the crystals could be composed of Fe-S protein fragments only. The nature of the fragments in the unit cell was probed by immuno-labelling with monovalent antibodies (Fab's), raised against the 75 -kDa subunit from the Fe-S protein, followed by image analysis.
