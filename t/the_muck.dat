5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots {{in a few months}} in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> and were useless. When <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Frank Clair {{was brought}} in as coach in 1950 and left his mark on the revamped roster; he led the team to Grey Cup wins in 1950 and 1952. The first of these was a 13–0 victory over Winnipeg in the notorious Mud Bowl. A November snow storm {{followed}} by mild conditions turned Varsity Stadium into a bog and the play was a shambles; one Winnipeg player {{is reported to have}} almost drowned in <b>the</b> <b>muck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> and were useless. When <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E

5|$|Florida's {{involvement}} in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate states because it had {{a fraction of the}} populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the USS Columbine, a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS Columbine, making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the Maple Leaf, which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.|$|E

25|$|Pail closets, outhouses, and cesspits {{were used}} to collect human waste. The use of human waste as {{fertilizer}} was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities {{did not have a}} functioning sewer system before the Industrial era, relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional rain showers to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, waste water simply ran down the streets, which had stepping stones to keep pedestrians out of <b>the</b> <b>muck,</b> and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the largest}} marine {{scrapyard}}s on the East Coast, the Witte Marine Scrapyard, known as the Staten Island boat graveyard, is located at 2453 Arthur Kill Road. Now officially known as the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility, the scrapyard was opened in 1964 by J. Arnold Witte, Sr. The scrapyard {{is known for its}} large assortment of obsolete steam tugs, ferries, carfloats, and other craft. Witte acquired them faster than he could break them up; the end result is dozens of vessels slowly rotting in <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> of the Arthur Kill. A number of noteworthy vessels, including the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt, which was involved in the rescue of survivors of the 1904 General Slocum tragedy and was the last coal-burning fireboat in operation in the FDNY's fleet, can be found here. Scenes from the 2010 thriller Salt, starring Angelina Jolie, were filmed on location at the Witte Marine Scrapyard.|$|E

500|$|Bean {{starred in}} the first season of Game of Thrones, HBO's {{adaptation}} of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin, playing the part of Lord Eddard Stark. Bean and Peter Dinklage were the two actors whose inclusion show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss considered necessary for the show to become a success, and for whose roles no other actors were considered. His portrayal won him critical praise; as The A.V. Club reviewer put it, he [...] "portrayed Ned {{as a man who}} knew he lived in <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> but hoped for better and assumed everyone else would come along for the ride."

[...] Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock's performance was a [...] "needed pick-me-up, presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse." [...] He added, [...] "In sum, the broadcast felt brisk, though not rushed. It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance."

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Cruttwell enlisted in the Royal Berkshire Regiment and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He fought in France and Belgium, until a severe leg wound in 1916 ended his front line military service. Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's experience in the trenches seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the general good manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist Evelyn Waugh, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that [...] "It was as though he had never cleansed himself from <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> of the trenches". [...] In {{the latter part of the}} war, Cruttwell was employed in the military intelligence department at the War Office in London, before returning to Oxford in 1919. In 1922, he published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits.|$|E

She writes her number in <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> on his rear windscreen but it later washes off in the rain. Some time later, Rachel's friend Karen advises her to call Adam and go on a date with him.

Adam wins her back by serenading her while wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{weather was}} {{unremarkable}} for two years. In 1928, construction was completed on the Tamiami Trail, named {{because it was}} the only road spanning between Tampa and Miami. The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted <b>the</b> <b>muck</b> down to the limestone, filled it with rock and paved over it. Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered. However, on September 16, 1928 came a massive storm, now known as the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1,770 (according to the Red Cross) to 3,000 or more. Many were swept away and never recovered. The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade. The catastrophe made national news, and although the governor again refused aid, after he toured the area and counted 126bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm, he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup, and declared in a telegram: [...] "Without exaggeration, the situation in the storm area beggars description".|$|E
