60|$|It {{will have}} been {{observed}} that in the list given in the previous chapter the works commonly published as Cicero's Philosophy have been divided. Some are called his Philosophy and some his Moral Essays. It seems to be absurd to put forward to the world his Tusculan Inquiries, written with the declared object of showing that death and pain were not evils, together with a moral essay, such as that De Officiis, in which he tells us what it may become {{a man of the}} world to do. It is as though we bound up Lord Chesterfield's letters in a volume with Hume's essays, and called them the philosophy of the eighteenth century. It might be true, but it would certainly be absurd. There might be those who regard the letters as philosophical, and those who would so speak of the essays; but their meaning would be diametrically opposite. It is so with Cicero, whose treatises have been lumped together under this name with the view of bringing them under one appellation. It had been found necessary to divide his works and to describe them. The happy man who first thought to put the De Natura Deorum and the De Amicitia into boards together, and to present them to the world under the name of his philosophy, perhaps found the only title that could unite the two. But he has done very much to mislead the world, and to <b>teach</b> <b>readers</b> to believe that Cicero was in truth one who endeavored to live in accordance with the doctrine of any special school of philosophy.|$|E

50|$|The {{book has}} proven controversial, {{as it was}} meant for {{teenagers}} (recommended by the publisher for ages 14 and up), thus raising questions about its propriety.

50|$|The {{reading and}} memory dynamic was very different. Books were a rare commodity; simply {{having access to}} a book one day did not imply access to it the next. Also {{at this point in}} time, books were not bound with outward facing spines; they were quite heavy, and lacked indexes. Even if one did have access to a book, it was {{unlikely}} that he/she would be able to find what he/she was looking for without having read and even become familiar with the book from top to bottom. In this point in time, external memory and internal memory blended together. Manuscripts were copied in order for the copier to memorize them. Instruction manuals, external memory aids, by Romans like Cicero and Quintilian also existed in order to <b>teach</b> <b>readers</b> how to use internal memory aids. Although, {{it should be noted that}} Quintilian agreed with Socrates' views on writing in Plato's Phaedrus'.|$|E
50|$|Marie Elizabeth {{organized}} her book, Questions to be Resolved, in {{a unique}} fashion. Instead of writing a novel, she describes scenes between two daughters and their mother in which the daughters display a deep commitment to their mother. In these short stories, the mother also {{plays the role of}} educator, a common theme throughout European women’s history, as she discusses the meaning of virtue, pleasure, history, and other philosophical questions. This makes her book relate towards her intended audience, mothers with daughters, and allows for a style that resembles a textbook rather than a narrative. Marie Elizabeth poses a series of questions following each dialogue or short play in order to reinforce what she is trying to <b>teach</b> <b>readers</b> in the chapters. The “Divisions” focus directly on the information from the dialogues and serve as a means to enlighten her readers and contain the answers to her questions. Her book is designed to be a teaching tool for young girls, taking noble French ideas about morality and turning them into a reading comprehension workbook. Marie Elizabeth not only produced a book of dialogues for learning, it is also a reflection of the values and society in which she lived.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{theme that}} {{is present in}} this book is that those who desire to grow spiritually will receive the help of God if they {{honestly}} have that desire. When talking to her mother before the parting, Ellen is determined to live a perfect, Christian life and be an example for everyone around her. However, {{as soon as she}} gets on the boat, she discovers that her heart holds negative feelings towards the people around her. After meeting the Christian man on the boat, she realizes how hard her heart is, and her desire to live a good life is rekindled. She fails at this again, however, when she gets to Aunt Fortune's house, where she directly disobeys her aunt and throws fits when things aren't done to her liking. But she realizes her mistakes and wants to be good, and God sends her a young woman who acts as a spiritual guide for the girl. Through this, Warner was telling people not to give up when they made mistakes, and showing how God comes to those who seek him. Since The Wide, Wide World is a Christian book, it aimed to <b>teach</b> <b>readers</b> how seek God and encourage those who didn’t exactly know how to go about doing that, but had a true desire to be closer to Him.|$|E
