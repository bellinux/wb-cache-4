25|$|Tartikoff {{felt there}} had been strong {{elements}} to Good Morning, Miss Bliss and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach. The elements featuring <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens. NBC had been losing {{the high end of}} their animated audience, kids from ten to twelve, so the idea was to create a live action comedy to air on Saturday mornings, a new idea at the time.|$|E
500|$|Stead drew {{inspiration}} from many sources {{in order to create}} the novel.

An idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our guns behind {{felt for}} the German guns. It was the damnest racket. Like giant lunatics smashing about amidst colossal pots and pans. They fired {{different}} sorts of shells; stink shells as well as Jack Johnsons, and though we didn't get much of that at our corner there was a sting of chlorine in the air all through the afternoon. Most of the stink shells fell short. We hadn't masks, but we rigged up a sort of protection with our handkerchiefs. And it didn't amount to very much. It was rather like the chemistry room after Heinrich and <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> been mixing things. Most of the time I was busy helping with {{the men who had}} got hurt. Suddenly there came a lull. Then some one said the Germans were coming, and I had a glimpse of them.|$|E

Sandridge departs and shortly <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> appears, pretending he <b>has</b> just arrived. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> {{sends a message to}} Sandridge through Domingo Sales, who claims that Gregorio is [...] "too ill of a fever to ride". The message says that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>has</b> arrived and explains that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>has</b> exchanged clothes with Tonia to foil pursuers. Sandridge returns to Tonia's home and sees two figures in the moonlight: one in men's clothing and the other in women's. The one in men's clothing rides away. Assuming this to be Tonia, Sandridge ambushes and shoots the remaining figure. The victim is Tonia, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>having</b> tricked Sandridge into killing his girlfriend.|$|R

50|$|A unique {{feature to}} the show was the Mouseketeers {{performing}} concerts on certain days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing {{in front of the}} audience.|$|E
50|$|The {{first round}} {{was a test}} of knowledge.

5000|$|Although his {{given name}} is Oderah, his {{nickname}} [...] "O. D." [...] {{was given to}} him {{when he was a young}} child.

His latest role is in the television seriers K9.|$|E
60|$|But in {{this affair}} <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> not felt <b>the</b> grim thirst for {{encounter}} that usually urged him on to battle.

And now he wanted no more blood. He {{wanted to get away}} and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face. Even a Mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood.|$|R
