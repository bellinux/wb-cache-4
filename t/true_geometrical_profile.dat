The model is based on analysis of the material deformation of thin plates under the action of axial cutting forces using a specifically designed test bed to reproduce commonly used flexible setup in industry. The cutting process is simplified as a static analysis of the material deformation under {{the effect of the}} applied cutting forces. In the analysis, different positions of the cutting tool during the machining process are studied to determine the workpiece’s <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> during milling. Several analyses are carried out for different positions of the cutting tool. The cutting force is also modeled to predict the cutting force for specific cutting conditions.

The experimental system is also designed to conduct tests with different cutting conditions on the three-axis Huron K 2 X 10 CNC milling machine to verify the predicted results obtained from the analysis model. The geometrical errors of the machined plates after machining are determined by using the Mitutoyo Bright Strato Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) to measure their <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> before and after machining processes. Finally, the mirror technique is utilized to compensate cutting deviations based on the predicted results of the workpiece’s displacements.
