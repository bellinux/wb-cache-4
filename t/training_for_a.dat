5|$|Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), {{also known}} by his ring name The Rock, is an American actor, {{producer}} and professional wrestler. Johnson {{was a college}} football player for the University of Miami, where he won a national championship on the 1991 Miami Hurricanes team. After being cut from the Calgary Stampeders of CFL two months into the 1995 season, Johnson began <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> career in professional wrestling, {{following in the footsteps}} of various family members, including his grandfather and his father, Rocky Johnson, from whom he inherited Canadian citizenship in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of reasons. It {{was far from the}} hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS {{took a long time to}} get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines {{were part}} of the reserve forces for the Battle of Iwo Jima and were {{committed}} to the action five days after D-Day. Among the Marines who distinguished themselves on Iwo Jima was Private Wilson D. Watson who received the Medal of Honor. After the island was secured, the unit was sent back to Guam where they underwent <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. The invasion never occurred since hostilities between Japan and the United States came to an end. The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was sent to Camp Pendelton where, in December 1945, it was once again disbanded.|$|E

To make ends meet, she worked at an outdoor store, as a gym teacher, and occasionally appeared on daredevil television shows.|$|E
5|$|Those ransomed were valued on {{a sliding}} scale, ranging from around 1,875DM for a manual worker to around 11,250DM for a doctor.

The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|Back on Guam, 3rd Battalion began <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{landing on}} Miyako Jima, an island {{just south of}} Okinawa. Those orders were {{eventually}} cancelled, but the battalion still saw minor combat in 1945, participating in two operations on Guam designed to capture Japanese soldiers still holding out in the hills. These sweeps took place in April and December 1945. 3rd Battalion also began preparing for Operation Olympic, where as part of V Amphibious Corps, it would have landed at Kushikino, Kagoshima on Kyūshū. After the dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945, and Japan's surrender, 3rd Battalion was detached from the 3rd Marine Division in November 1945 and deactivated the following month on 12 December 1945. Shortly before it was deactivated, however, 3rd Battalion suffered the dubious honor of having the last American killed in World War II, when PFC W.C. Patrick Bates of Kilo Company was shot by a Japanese sniper on 14 December during a mopping up operation on Guam (three months after the formal end of hostilities).|$|E

5|$|McDowall fined Revie £27 {{for missing}} {{two weeks of}} <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won {{permission}} from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie {{for much of the}} 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's orders raised several issues, {{the first}} with the {{transport}} aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations. When they had arrived in North Africa, it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart, the 51st, with 82nd Airborne Division. A few weeks later this arrangement was switched, with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division; this seemed a logical decision, as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with. However, the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider-based one was problematic; the 51st had practically no glider experience, whilst the 52nd had much more but was already <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parachute-based mission. To switch both was impractical and would {{have led to a}} number of problems, which left 1st Airborne Division, and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade, with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing.|$|E
