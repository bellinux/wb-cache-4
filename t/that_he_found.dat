5|$|The series {{demonstrates}} his intense {{study of}} light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> wanting. However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.|$|E
5|$|A more {{contemporary}} prison artist was Dennis (NOZ) Nozworthy, who stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> art on death row, in 1982. Some {{of his work}} currently is held in the collections of Curtin University, Perth Central TAFE, and the WA Government, Department of Justice.|$|E

5|$|Darlington relates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> in the New York City library Carl Jacobi's {{original}} {{paper on}} elliptic functions, published in Latin in 1829. In this paper Darlington {{was surprised to}} find foldout tables of the exact elliptic function transformations needed for Chebyshev approximations of both Cauer's image parameter, and Darlington's insertion-loss filters.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, {{and no one}} is {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.|$|E

5|$|Juan Ponce de León charted Key Biscayne on {{his first}} mission to the New World in 1513. He christened the island Santa Marta and claimed it for the Spanish Crown. He {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a fresh water spring on the island. Ponce de León called the bay behind the island (Biscayne Bay) Chequescha, a variant form of Tequesta.|$|E
5|$|Manuel José Reyes stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> {{no reason}} to depose the Viceroy, {{and that it would}} be enough to appoint a junta headed by Cisneros. His {{proposal}} had nearly 30votes. Another 30votes supported Cisneros, with no change to the political system. A small group supported the proposal of Martín José de Choteco, who also supported Cisneros.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Rare's video game composer David Wise, his first NES composing job. In a December2010 interview, Wise said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the NES sound board work challenging. He had to first code the HEX values for each note by hand before converting them into subroutines with a computer. Wise recalled thinking {{that his first}} NES projects sounded like doorbells. He was humbled that others continue to remix his tracks.|$|E

5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over {{the choice of a}} subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1945, Smyth {{approached}} Datus C. Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|Keith, Veronica's {{father and}} owner of Mars Investigations, their detective firm, visits Veronica in jail. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris), a local public defender, also arrives, and tells Veronica {{that she has been}} all but cleared, but Sheriff Lamb will keep her in custody {{for as long as he}} can because he still {{believes}} she was involved in Josh's disappearance. Keith returns to Mars Investigations, where Hank Landry arrives and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a bugging device in his phone. Landry had been implicated in the ongoing investigation into the death of Cyrus O’Dell, dean of Hearst College where Veronica is a student. Keith denies that he or Veronica placed the device in his phone, but Hank becomes angry, telling him to stop investigating him.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E
