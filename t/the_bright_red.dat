5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first {{isolated from the}} species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve present bright star calibration, data were {{gathered}} for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> and blue stars and the Cepheids in the Im V dwarf galaxy, Sextans A. On {{the basis of a}} magnitude sequence measured to V and B values of about 22 and 23, respectively, the mean magnitudes of <b>the</b> three <b>brightest</b> blue stars are V= 17. 98 and B= 17. 88. <b>The</b> three <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> supergiants have V= 18. 09 and B= 20. 14. The periods and magnitudes measured for five Cepheids yield an apparent blue distance modulus of 25. 67 + or - 0. 2, via the P-L relation, and the mean absolute magnitudes of V=- 7. 56 and B=- 5. 53 for the red supergiants provide additional calibration of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> stars as distance indicators. If Sextans A were placed at the distance of the Virgo cluster, it would appear to have a surface brightness of 23. 5 mag/sq arcec.

5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, {{arranged in a}} corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> {{stars in}} galaxies {{have been used}} as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> stars and <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars, while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> stars and 0. 46 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars. <b>The</b> reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars are available (Figure 1).

25|$|In India, {{during the}} French colonial rule of Pondicherry, Yanam, Karaikal and Mahé, Kepis were worn by {{two kinds of}} policemen, the Armed and the Indigenous, {{differentiated}} by the colour of the kepis they wore.

25|$|In the {{universities}} of the UK {{there are days}} called scarlet days or red letter days. On such days, doctors of the university may wear their scarlet 'festal' or full dress gowns instead of their undress ('black') gown. This is more significant for the ancient universities such as Oxford and Cambridge where academic dress is worn almost daily, the black undress gown being worn on normal occasions as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> gowns. Since most universities have abandoned academic dress to the graduation ceremony (where doctors always wear scarlet), the significance of scarlet days has all but disappeared.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{measurements}} of the bolometric magnitudes of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> giants in 26 globular clusters are {{used to determine the}} brightness difference between the tip of the red giant branch (on average found to be 0. 1 mag <b>brighter</b> than <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> giant) and RR Lyrae stars. The metallicity variation of the result agrees perfectly with theoretical predictions. In conjunction with previous determinations of the number ratio of horizontal-branch versus red giant stars, with statistical parallax determinations of RR Lyrae absolute luminosities, and with theoretical predictions based on the Sweigart and Gross evolutionary sequences, this result yields an allowed range for a hypothetical core mass variation relative to the standard results of (0. 009 + or - 0. 012) solar mass. If neutrinos had anomalous electromagnetic dipole moments, the increased energy loss near the helium flash would lead to an increased core mass. Constraints on neutrino electromagnetic properties are determined from the color-magnitude diagrams of the globular clusters...|$|R

25|$|Another account {{involves}} a 9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder, Kaldi, who, noticing the energizing effects when his flock nibbled on <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> berries {{of a certain}} bush, chewed on the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks to come and investigate. The roasted beans were quickly raked from the embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee.

25|$|But {{with these}} {{potential}} hazards, Clayton and Bell consistently turned out windows {{in which the}} balance of colour is eminently satisfying to the eye. They had the happy knack of selecting exactly the right tonal values so that difficult colour combinations, (such as red and green laid side by side as the cloth and lining of a cloak) appear inevitable. Moreover, their colour choices are rarely timid. (A “safe” choice is to line every cloak with yellow {{in the form of}} an applied silver-stain.) Although most of the colours in their windows are primaries- basic red, yellow and blue with a mid-tone grassy green, they introduced judiciously placed tertiary colours such as russet, brownish purple and a sort of mustard colour. The mustard colour often appears in conjunction with a bright intense blue. They frequently clothed a central figure in a robe of this bright blue, in contrast to the dark blue of the background and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> of surrounding robes.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} {{interpretation}} of the Dieppe maps, Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University argued that the Dieppe school of cartographers {{should be seen as}} acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims. The decades from about 1535 to 1562 when the Dieppe school of cartographers flourished were also the period in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th-century height, in terms of the North Atlantic fish trade, the fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative brazilwood. <b>The</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> dye produced from brazilwood replaced woad as the primary dyestuff in the cloth industry in France and the Low Countries. The Dieppe cartographers used the skills and geographic knowledge of Portuguese mariners, pilots and geographers working in France to produce maps meant to emphasize French interests in and dominion over territory in the New World that the Portuguese also claimed, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil. Brunelle noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe maps represented a blending of the latest knowledge circulating in Europe with older visions of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new information often coexisting uneasily in the same map.|$|E
