5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> diameter. In addition, if <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily upon <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> {{being used}} and the desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.|$|E
50|$|The current that {{is output}} by the battery through a meter {{will depend on}} the size of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> how far <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> are {{inserted}} into the fruit, and how close to each other <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> are placed; <b>the</b> voltage is fairly independent of these details of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{triggering}} <b>electrode</b> is {{most often}} mounted {{through a hole in}} the center of <b>the</b> positive main <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> undrilled main <b>electrode</b> is <b>the</b> negative <b>electrode.</b> When switching high currents, <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> undergo considerable heat stress, as they are directly involved in the electric arc. This causes the surfaces to undergo gradual vaporization, so some designs incorporate methods to easily adjust the distance between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> or to actually replace <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>electrodes</b> are typically fabricated from brass, or alloys of copper and tungsten for longer electrode life.|$|R
30|$|The {{first is}} {{fluctuation}} and limited time-response of the electrostatic adhesion force. When voltage is applied between <b>the</b> pad <b>electrode</b> and <b>the</b> screen <b>electrode,</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> deform {{due to the}} electrostatic adhesion force. The resulting gap variation between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> can fluctuate <b>the</b> electrostatic force. Especially, when a soft conductive rubber is utilized as <b>the</b> pad <b>electrode,</b> <b>the</b> electrostatic adhesion force suddenly increases as the voltage is gradually increased, probably due to a sudden change of the gap between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> [12]. <b>The</b> deformation of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> also affects <b>the</b> time-response of the electrostatic force. As a result, on the actual device, the force does not simply follow the square-law.|$|R
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> tends to build up on the end of <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|Inductively coupled plasma (ICP): {{similar to}} a CCP and with similar {{applications}} but <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> consists of a coil wrapped around the chamber where plasma is formed.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> and the amount of current. While {{maintaining}} a constant separation between <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to {{the front end of the}} weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{and reference}} electrode work in unison to balance out the charge added or removed by <b>the</b> working <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> auxiliary <b>electrode</b> balances <b>the</b> working <b>electrode,</b> {{but in order}} to know how much potential it has to add or remove it relies on <b>the</b> reference <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> reference <b>electrode</b> has a known reduction potential. <b>The</b> auxiliary <b>electrode</b> tries to keep <b>the</b> reference <b>electrode</b> at a certain reduction potential and to do this it has to balance <b>the</b> working <b>electrode.</b>|$|R
50|$|The common {{laboratory}} conductivity meters {{employ a}} potentiometric method and four <b>electrodes.</b> Often, <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> are cylindrical and arranged concentrically. <b>The</b> <b>electrodes</b> are usually made of platinum metal. An alternating current {{is applied to}} the outer pair of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> <b>The</b> potential between the inner pair is measured. Conductivity could in principle be determined using the distance between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> and their surface area using Ohm's law but generally, for accuracy, a calibration is employed using electrolytes of well-known conductivity.|$|R
3000|$|... ctof <b>the</b> NEA/GOD <b>electrode</b> is 453 Ω, {{which is}} {{apparently}} {{smaller than that}} of <b>the</b> Au/GOD <b>electrode</b> (3, 362 Ω). The CPE of <b>the</b> NEA/GOD <b>electrode</b> is 3.1 μF, which is smaller than that of <b>the</b> Au/GOD <b>electrode</b> (4.9 μF). This can be ascribed to the structural difference of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> <b>The</b> surface of <b>the</b> bare Au <b>electrode</b> is flat, which {{can be described as}} two dimensions, while <b>the</b> nanowire array <b>electrode</b> fills three dimensions. The GOD spread as a compact film on <b>the</b> bare Au <b>electrode,</b> while it can fill in the space of nanowires on <b>the</b> NEA <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> gold nanowires effectively improved the conductivity of <b>the</b> NEA/GOD <b>electrode</b> and thus decreased the charge-transfer resistance. The special structure of <b>the</b> NEA/GOD <b>electrode</b> also led to a small CPE. The EIS analysis indicates that the three-dimensional structure of <b>the</b> NEA/GOD <b>electrode</b> is advantageous for the charge-transfer, which is an excellent characteristic for amperometric biosensors.|$|R
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> affects weld properties. If <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Due to its heat {{resistance}} and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium {{is a good}} scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps. Hafnium is also used as <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> in plasma cutting because {{of its ability to}} shed electrons into air.|$|E

5000|$|The Spark Erosion (EDM) process {{calls for}} copper {{tungsten}}. Usually, {{this process is}} used with graphite, but tungsten has a high melting point (3420 0C). This allows <b>the</b> CuW <b>electrodes</b> to have a longer service life than <b>the</b> graphite <b>electrodes.</b> This is crucial when <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> have been processed with complex machining. Since <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> are susceptible to wear <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> provide more geometrical accuracy than <b>the</b> other <b>electrodes.</b> These properties also let the rods and tubes manufactured for spark erosion be made smaller in diameter and have a longer length since the material {{is less likely to}} chip and warp. đ ...|$|R
30|$|The {{design of}} EEG {{acquisition}} mode, {{in the analysis}} of EEG signals, generally consider the following three aspects: First, how to design the experimental process to “inducate” the subject to “transmit” a reasonable signal; Second, the setting of various parameters; Third, the number and position of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> <b>the</b> more <b>electrodes,</b> <b>the</b> more complex the algorithm, the effect may be better; <b>the</b> fewer <b>the</b> <b>electrodes,</b> <b>the</b> simpler the algorithm, the worse the effect may be.|$|R
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|E

Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, −38.8344°C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).|$|E
5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
30|$|Electrophoretic {{deposition}} {{was performed}} in the cell composed of two electrodes; the first {{is at the bottom}} of an insulating (Teflon) bottle, and the second is on the top. On <b>the</b> bottom <b>electrode,</b> <b>the</b> InP wafer was mounted by a conductive silver colloid paint, and the colloid solution was placed between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> (<b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> was 2 mm). Both polarities of deposition were realized; the negative deposition (ND), where negative voltage was applied to <b>the</b> bottom <b>electrode,</b> and <b>the</b> positive deposition (PD) with the positive voltage to <b>the</b> bottom <b>electrode.</b> <b>The</b> applied voltage was from 30 to 100 V for various times.|$|R

40|$|Wedge-cut {{samples of}} {{fatigued}} ferroelectric {{lead zirconate titanate}} ceramics were investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy in conjunction with conventional electrical hysteresis measurements. The local clamping of domains is monitored at different depths in the sample. The coercive fields in grains near <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> differ for different materials and preparation methods of <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> For silver, fatigue consistently generates a space charge in {{the depth of the}} sample. For platinum <b>electrodes,</b> <b>the</b> fatigue behavior scatters strongly.

5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized depends on <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> {{the composition of}} the workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by <b>the</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> which can lead to porosity in the deposit if <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat <b>the</b> <b>electrode.</b> In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
