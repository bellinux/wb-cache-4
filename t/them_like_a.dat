5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

Some Judges openly view them as a nuisance to be removed, or like Judge Manners, as a sub-human race to be used and abused as the Judges see fit.|$|E

On The Virgin Tour, Madonna {{performed}} the song wearing an entirely black costume, consisting of a crop top worn beneath a vest, fringed elbow length gloves, a fringed miniskirt, leggings, and low heel leather boots. She also wore a crucifix earring in one ear and a silver cross pattée was pinned to the right shoulder of her vest. Madonna sang the original version of the song, and pranced around the stage while showing her stomach. The performance {{was included in the}} [...] VHS, released in 1985. At the Who's That Girl World Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was performed as the second song of the set list. Madonna wore a black bustier like the music video to her single [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] (1987). Her hair was platinum blond and in a big bushy shape.

500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

He stated that [...] "the album is at best another good step toward their once great state and not a full return to it. What's true, though, is that it's the group's best full album since Vitalogy." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club ranked the album B+, {{considering}} it the [...] "tightest Pearl Jam album in a decade", describing the album as a comeback [...] "filled with straight-up, riff-a-riffic rock songs." [...] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars. The review said, [...] "elf-titled with good reason: Pearl Jam sound reborn, vital." [...] Kyle Anderson of Spin gave the album three out of five stars. He said that [...] "rather than rage against the time machine, they seem to be having fun... Pearl Jam are taking themselves less seriously, and it fits <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> snug flannel shirt." [...] Mat Snow of The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars. In the review he stated that Vedder [...] "musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst." [...] Snow observed, [...] "And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the Who or Led Zeppelin, from whom the band draw much of their style, Pearl Jam play like men on a mission."

500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{gained an}} {{aggregate}} rating of 78.50% at GameRankings, {{which would be}} a mostly positive metascore. AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people will take to <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fish to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Tony Sawicki, a trans man {{and another}} clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett {{during the development}} of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be [...] "very tied to the themes of our show about identity" [...] and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created [...] "a minefield of sexual politics", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to [...] "just throw this character in there and treat <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal human being like we would anyone else on the show".|$|E
500|$|U2 Live at Red Rocks {{is often}} cited as a {{watershed}} moment in U2's history which established their reputation as an exceptional live act. In the liner notes of the remastered version of the film, music journalist Anthony DeCurtis wrote, [...] "this concert set goals for U2 that might have daunted any other young band. But {{in the shadow of}} their wild ambitions at Red Rocks, these four boys met, once again, the men of their future, and became who they would become." [...] Rolling Stone called the band's performance of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] from the film one of the [...] "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll". The magazine said, [...] "he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide." [...] Director Gavin Taylor said that the video [...] "kick-started their career" [...] and [...] "fired <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rocket into the sky". In 2009, Relix named U2's performance at Red Rocks the 24th-best concert of all time. The Denver Post said the concert affirmed Red Rocks Amphitheatre's status as a premier outdoor venue. Rocky Mountain News said that the concert was [...] "asily one of the most famous, acclaimed concerts of the 1980s (if not all time)", and that people who have visited the Amphitheatre ever since have been disappointed to learn that the pyres {{are not part of the}} venue and were only used for the U2 concert. Music biographer Dave Thompson said the concert [...] "transformed U2...into a very successful rock band", and that without U2, [...] "Red Rocks would be just another smartly lit amphitheater".|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E

It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows <b>them</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
