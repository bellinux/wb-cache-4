40|$|We {{present the}} {{three-dimensional}} structure of an actin filament bundle from the sperm of Limulus. The bundle is a motile structure which by changing its twist, converts from a coiled to an extended form. The bundle {{is composed of}} actin plus two auxiliary proteins of molecular masses 50 and 60 kD. Fraying the bundle with potassium thiocyanate created three classes of filaments: actin, actin plus the 60 -kD protein, and actin plus both the auxiliary proteins. We examined these filaments by transmission electron microscopy and {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM). Three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micrographs allowed us to visualize the actin subunit and the 60 - and 50 -kD subunits bound to it. The actin subunit appears to be bilobed with dimensions 70 X 40 X 35 A. The inner lobe of the actin subunit, located at 20 A radius, is a prolate ellipsoid, 50 X 25 A; the outer actin lobe, at 30 A radius, is a 35 -A-diam spheroid. Attached to the inner lobe of actin is the 60 -kD protein, an oblate spheroid, 55 X 40 A, at 50 A radius. The armlike 50 -kD protein, at 55 A radius, links the 60 -kD protein on one of actin's <b>twin</b> <b>strands</b> to the outer lobe of the actin subunit on the opposite strand. We speculate that the 60 -kD protein may be a bundling protein and that the 50 -kD protein may be responsible for the change in twist of the filaments which causes extension of the bundle...|$|R

40|$|Children who {{experience}} domestic violence between their parents, or other adults at home, {{are not just}} passive observers. They are profoundly impacted by violence and coercive behaviour at home, and they find complex, creative ways to manage and cope with these experiences. This is a key finding of the research project ‘Understanding Agency and Resistance Strategies – Children in Situations of Domestic Violence’. This two year project, funded by the European Commission and led by Dr Jane Callaghan at the University of Northampton, is the largest qualitative study of children’s experiences of domestic violence conducted to date. Researchers in Greece, Italy, Spain and the UK interviewed 110 {{children and young people}} who had experienced domestic violence, focused on how they experienced the violence, and how they found ways to manage their experiences. Using the insights gained from this research, the team developed a group-based therapeutic intervention to support children to build on their existing strengths and coping strategies. The intervention aims to help the young people develop resilience and a positive sense of self, as they recover from living with domestic violence. The UNARS researchers argue that we should challenge passive images of children {{who experience}} domestic violence has been skewed by media coverage and images, which portray them as passive, helpless victims, doomed to repeat cycles of violence in their own later relationships. The UNARS research is not suggesting that domestic violence is not an acutely painful experience for children – of course it is frightening, distressing, and children are hurt and wounded by the violence they live with, and the coercive and controlling behaviours that often pervade their homes. However, it is also clear, in children’s accounts, that there is an inextricable intertwining of their experiences of damage and of coping. Children’s experiences of domestic violence is a little like a double helix, with the <b>twin</b> <b>strands</b> of coping and damage very closely interlinked. Children’s capacity to be strong, to be agentic, to be resilient can only be read {{in the context of the}} actions that function to undermine their development of agency and resilience, forms of relating that characterise violence, abuse and coercive control...|$|R

40|$|Daughters of Death is {{a popular}} {{collection}} of true crime stories concerning women and murder, published in 1973 as a special issue of the Great Australian Crimes series. Sold at 50 c through newsagents, it contains a collection of 13 historical stories written by the veteran journalist Hugh Buggy, enclosed by a wraparound contemporary feature, ‘Babysitters Turn Killers!’, by a younger journalist, Ian Moffitt. Both titles appear on the cover: the main coverline Daughters of Death is placed above a grainy, enlarged black and white image of the faces of two girls, identified as the babysitter killers in a minor coverline slashed across the bottom right-hand corner of the image. The collection follows a tradition of mid-century true crime miscellanies that use women as an organising category, such as James Holledge’s 1963 Australia’s Wicked Women. However, in its idiosyncratic bundling of two types of true crime journalism, historical and contemporary, the magazine links this interest in women and criminality to shifts in technologies of the popular media and in the genre of true crime itself. The juxtapositions of the collection mark a shift in true crime writing in Australia, from a tradition centred on individual crimes, criminals and the authoritative narrator, {{to a form of}} journalism informed by contemporary developments in criminology which deflects criminal responsibility to society and its media representations. These <b>twin</b> <b>strands</b> of true crime writing still exist in the genre: historical accounts of significant Australian crimes continue to be published beside accounts of individual crimes, often unresolved, which bring a sociological focus to their amateur criminology. In this magazine, however, the sociological new journalism of ‘Babysitters Turn Killers’ is literally wrapped around the older collection of historical accounts of women and true crime contained within Daughters of Death, juxtaposing in stark contrast the old and new forms of the genre. This article examines how this apparently teleological shift towards an increased self-referentiality might be understood, in a genre which has been read as pointing to, in all its forms, the ‘media apriori [sic] in modern society’. Using media self-referentiality as the starting point of analysis, I use the juxtapositions of this text to open up new ways of thinking about how the forms through which the genre’s media a priori are expressed differ according to local historical contexts and their attendant media technologies. Beneath the opposing rhetorics of certainty and incoherence that characterise the two forms of the genre are surprising continuities, particularly in the troping of women as figures of blame. Yet at the same time, differing technologies of media alter the ways in which such tropes are made explicit or disguised, and their curious juxtaposition in this hybrid form denaturalises the genre’s functioning in its different modes. Despite the cover image identifying the faces of the babysitter killers as, simultaneously, daughters of death, this elision is never fully effected in the text of the magazine. It is in the space created by their imperfect identifications - where the babysitter killers and the daughters of death diverge - that specific generic histories and their constructions of gender might be examined...|$|R
5000|$|Kernmantle {{construction}} may be {{used for}} both static and dynamic ropes. Static ropes are designed to allow relatively little stretch, which is most useful for applications such as hauling and rappelling. Dynamic rope is used to belay climbers, and is designed to stretch under a heavy load to absorb the shock of a fallen climber. Dynamic ropes manufactured for climbing are tested by the UIAA. A test of [...] "single" [...] standard rope involves tying an 80 kg (176 pound) weight {{to the end of a}} length of rope. This weight is then dropped 5 meters (16½ feet) on 2.7 meters (9 feet) of rope, with the rope running over a rounded surface simulating that of a standard carabiner. This process is repeated until the rope breaks. For [...] "double" [...] ropes the weight is 55 kg, and for <b>twin</b> ropes two <b>strands</b> are used. In addition to the number of drops, the impact force is also measured. It is a common misunderstanding to think that the number of drop test falls (as conducted by the UIAA) is the number of real-life climbing falls a rope can sustain before it becomes unsafe. The drop test falls are of extreme severity and a real-life climbing fall will not often generate a comparable force. This adds a margin of safety for climbers who use such ropes.|$|R
