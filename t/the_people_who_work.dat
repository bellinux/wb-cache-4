Researchers have identified {{that one of}} the best ways to increase the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with Neopets and Whyville, or indirectly as with the Harry Potter series' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests). The solution to the problem of societal pigeonholing of female gamers is often identified as interventionist work such as the insertion of women into the industry. Groups like WomenGamers.com and Sony's G.I.R.L. have sought to increase female gamer demographics by giving scholarships to girls considering getting into game development, and game developers like Check Six Games, Her Interactive, Silicon Sisters and Purple Moon have openly courted female coders and developers.|$|E

In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls for a guy super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character has been in the past.

[...] Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song [...] "Enter Sandman"; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the [...] "Chair of Broken Dreams"; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization.

He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and work with us is bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{professional}} dominatrix {{or professional}} dominant, {{often referred to}} within the culture as a [...] "pro-dom(me)", offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. The term [...] "dominatrix" [...] is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a [...] "domme", [...] "dominant", or [...] "femdom". There are also services provided by professional female submissives ("pro-subs"). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional dungeon. Professional submissives, although far more rare, do exist. Most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities, especially when sadomasochism is involved.

In an 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Young expressed the mission of the Urban League not as ground-level activism in itself but as the supplement and complement of the activities of all other organizations; he states, [...] "we are the social engineers, we are the strategists, we are the planners, we are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> at the level of policy-making, policy implementation, the highest echelons of the corporate community, the highest echelons of the governmental community – both at the federal, state and local level – the highest echelons of the labor movement."

2500|$|There {{were three}} key {{elements}} in the writing process. First, Chibnall largely ignored traditional concepts about narrative structure when writing the teleplay. Instead, he focused on how the murder affected each character, and let each character's responses drive the story. His lone concession to narrative structure was driven {{by the need to}} insert a commercial break every 11 to 12 minutes. He chose to insert a surprising or shocking moment just before each break to encourage viewers to keep watching. This forced Chibnall to [...] "aggressively plot" [...] each episode, keeping the story as tight as possible so that he could focus on character development. Second, Chibnall emphasised the role of the local newspaper in the series. Having lived in the small Dorset town of Bridport, Chibnall saw how local newspapers had a major impact on their communities despite the prominence of new media such as the Internet. He created a fictional local newspaper, the Broadchurch Echo, and made it not only an element of the story (revealing information to which characters react) but also a character in the story itself, motivated by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> there. Third, Chibnall planned for a visual rather than dialogue-driven finale. Chibnall wanted the final episode of Broadchurch to be different than the typical murder-mystery series. He observed that most finales saved major revelations until the final minutes of the final episode. He felt this led to poor writing, with loose plot threads [...] "hastily" [...] tied up and no way for the audience to adjust emotionally to the new information. Chibnall decided his [...] "reveal" [...] would occur early in the final episode, and more time would be given to depicting the impact of the reveal on the characters. He also wanted to avoid a reveal which was primarily verbal, as occurred in many detective novels. Chibnall wanted his reveal to be visual and highly cinematic, and for time to slow down during the reveal to heighten the audience's tension. This, he felt, would help the audience feel as if they were actually part of the drama, as if they were really experiencing these events themselves.|$|E
