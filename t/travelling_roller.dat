The present layout and operation process of each section (i. e. material storage, cutting, welding, machining shop, fabrication shop, assembly and inspection section and finish product storage) have been investigated. The problem in the space utilization and material flow pattern was identified. The result showed that raw material section, cutting section and fabrication shops should be allocated to make the good material flow. The suitable of new plant layout can decrease the distance of material flow, which rises production...|$|E

5000|$|A tension meter is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} tension in wires, cables, textiles, belts and more. Meters {{commonly}} use a 3 roller system where the material <b>travels</b> through the <b>rollers</b> causing deflection in the center roller that is connected to an analog indicator or load cell on digital models. Single roll tension sensors and sonic tension meters are other types of tension meters. Tension may also be inferred from the frequency of vibration of the material under stress by solving the [...] "Vibrating String Equation". Tension meters are available as handheld devices or as equipment for fixed installations. These are basically necessary {{to build up a}} tension-controlled closed loop.|$|R

5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of <b>travel.</b> The <b>roller</b> brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|R
40|$|The out-of-plane {{instability}} of a moving plate, <b>travelling</b> between two <b>rollers</b> with constant velocity, is studied, {{taking into account}} the mutual interaction between the buckled plate and the surrounding, axially flowing ideal fluid. Transverse displacement of the buckled plate (assumed cylindrical) is described by an integro-differential equation that includes the centrifugal force, the aerodynamic reaction of the external medium, the vertical projection of membrane tension, and the bending force. The aerodynamic reaction is found analytically as a functional of the displacement. To find the critical divergence velocity of the moving plate and its corresponding buckling mode, an eigenvalue problem and variational principle are derived. Plate divergence, both within a vacuum and when submerged in an external medium, is investigated with the application of analytical and numerical techniques...|$|R

40|$|Problems of {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a moving web, modelled as an elastic rod or string, and axially <b>travelling</b> between <b>rollers</b> (supports) at a constant velocity, are studied using analytical approaches. Transverse, longitudinal and torsional vibrations of the moving web are described by a hyperbolic second-order partial differential equation, corresponding to the string and rod models. It is shown that {{in the framework of}} a quasi-static eigenvalue analysis, for these models, the critical point cannot be unstable. The critical velocities of one-dimensional webs, and the arising non-trivial solution of free vibrations, are studied analytically. The dynamical analysis is then extended into the case with damping. The critical points of both static and dynamic types are found analytically. It is shown in the paper that if external friction is present, then for mode numbers sufficiently high, dynamic critical points may exist. Graphical examples of eigenvalue spectra are given for both the undamped and damped systems. In the examples, it is seen that external friction leads to stabilization, whereas internal friction in the travelling material will destabilize the system in a dynamic mode at the static critical point. The theory and results summarize and extend theoretical knowledge of the class of models studied, and can be used in various applications of moving materials, such as paper making processes...|$|R

40|$|Problems of {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a moving web, <b>travelling</b> between two <b>rollers</b> at a constant velocity, are studied using analytical approaches. Transverse vibrations of the web are described by a partial differential equation that includes the centrifugal force, in-plane tension, elastic reaction and nonstationary inertial terms. The model of a thin elastic plate subjected to bending and non-homogeneous tension is {{used to describe the}} bending moment and the distribution of membrane forces. The stability of the plate is investigated with the help of studies of small out-of-plane vibrations. The influence of linearly distributed in-plane tension on the characteristics of the web vibrations is studied. The static forms of instability are investigated using numerical methods. It can be concluded that inhomogeneities in the applied tension may significantly decrease the critical web velocities and even small inhomogeneities in the tension may have a large effect on the divergence forms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the probability of}} fracture in {{a system in which}} a material <b>travels</b> supported by <b>rollers.</b> The moving material is subjected to longitudinal tension for which deterministic and stochastic models are studied. In the stochastic model, the tension is described by a multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The material is assumed to have initial cracks perpendicular to the travelling direction, and a stochastic counting process describes the occurrence of cracks in the longitudinal direction of the material. The material is modelled as isotropic and elastic, and LEFM is applied. For a general counting process, when there is no fluctuation in tension, the reliability of the system can be simulated by applying conditional sampling. With the stochastic tension model, considering fracture of the material leads to a first passage time problem, the solution of which is estimated by simulation. As an example, the probability of fracture is computed for periodically occurring cracks with parameters typical to printing presses and paper material. The numerical results suggest that small cracks are not likely to affect the pressroom runnability. The results also show that tension variations may significantly increase the probability of fracture...|$|R
40|$|A {{compact and}} {{lightweight}} mechanism has been developed to accurately move a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) scan mirror (a cube corner) in a near-linear fashion with near constant speed at cryogenic temperatures. This innovation includes a slide mechanism to restrict motion to one dimension, an actuator to drive the motion, and a linear velocity transducer (LVT) to measure the speed. The cube corner mirror is double-passed in one arm of the FTS; double-passing is required to compensate for optical beam shear resulting from tilting of the moving cube corner. The slide, actuator, and LVT are off-the-shelf components {{that are capable of}} cryogenic vacuum operation. The actuator drives the slide for the required travel of 2. 5 cm. The LVT measures translation speed. A proportional feedback loop compares the LVT voltage with the set voltage (speed) to derive an error signal to drive the actuator and achieve near constant speed. When the end of the scan is reached, a personal computer reverses the set voltage. The actuator and LVT have no moving parts in contact, and have magnetic properties consistent with cryogenic operation. The unlubricated slide restricts motion to linear <b>travel,</b> using crossed <b>roller</b> bearings consistent with 100 -million- stroke operation. The mechanism tilts several arc seconds during transport of the FTS mirror, which would compromise optical fringe efficiency when using a flat mirror. Consequently, a cube corner mirror is used, which converts a tilt into a shear. The sheared beam strikes (at normal incidence) a flat mirror {{at the end of the}} FTS arm with the moving mechanism, thereby returning upon itself and compensating for the shea...|$|R
40|$|Flow forming is an {{advanced}} version of metal spinning process {{which is used}} to manufacture sheet metal products having symmetrically axial geometry and also to produce long thin-wall tubes with precision dimensions and desired mechanical property. In flow forming of tubes, the workpiece is held onto the mandrel as the forming roller moves along the workpiece axially to reduce the diameter. Author has developed a few concepts of flow forming tool that built to accommodate the lathe tool post. One of the concept consists of two rollers set has been fabricated. This tool is rigid enough to perform flow forming at lathe machine and can flow-form tubes with a diameter up to 100 mm. This tooling assembly is attached at Pinacho SP/ 165 conventional lathe machine to perform flow forming process. The selected work material is aluminium alloy 6061 that widely applied at light-weighted industries. The main objectives of this research is to analyse the influences of major process parameters such as feed rate, spindle speed and depth of cut on wall thickness changes, internal diameter growth and roundness of the finished products. The dimensions of the finish products are measured using Carl Zeiss Coordinate Measuring Machine. It is found that wall thickness changes decreases and external diameter increases as the <b>roller</b> <b>travels</b> along the tube. It is also found that higher feed rate of rollers and lower thickness reductions have advantages for obtaining smaller internal diameter growth. The tube with good roundness also can be obtained by flow-form the tube using lower thickness reductions. Material structure test also has been conducted to confirm the direction of the flow of material during the process...|$|R
