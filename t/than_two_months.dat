40|$|Recently {{safe and}} {{repeatable}} techniques of in vitro embryo production have been developed. The source of oocytes were ovaries of slaughtered donors for early in vitro procedures (Galli et al., 1996).

Now the oocytes are more frequently recovered from live animals by trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte collection (Galli et al., 2001). Ultrasound-guided oocyte aspiration (ovum pick-up, OPU) combined with in vitro embryo produc-tion represents replacing procedures of traditional embryo transfer technologies in cattle (Kruip et al., 1991).
