5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges {{on the inside of the}} nasal cavity and a ridge at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E

5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint.

5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight {{at all times}} can {{discourage}} the bird.

Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

[...] Rangel had <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Democratic power bases, however, and won the primary by a 3–to–1 margin and the general election easily.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located toward <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main room, were also present {{in many of the}} houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the {{mechanism by which}} it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
