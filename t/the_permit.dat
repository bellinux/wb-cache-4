5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over <b>the</b> <b>permit</b> revenue.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>permit,</b> however, {{was that no}} work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within <b>the</b> <b>permit</b> they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself.

5|$|In {{response}} to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players {{in favour of}} foreign players, in 1999, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.

From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at <b>the</b> <b>permit</b> stations located at each entry point.

5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824.

Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to build an}} arena in the area was first presented by Nilsson in May 1997, and developed further over the following decade. <b>The</b> <b>permit</b> to start building Malmö Arena was granted in September 2006, and the first sod was turned on 10 January 2007 by Nilsson, hockey players Pekka Lindmark, Juha Rihiijärvi, and Carl Söderberg, and two politicians from Malmö Stad.

The arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helkiö of Pöyry Architects, and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million kronor– 100 million kronor over budget because of additions to the initial plan. The arena was entirely financed by Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB. Malmö Arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008 with a large concert featuring a variety of artists, among them Robyn, Helen Sjöholm, Sanne Salomonsen, and Jill Johnson.|$|E
5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing <b>the</b> <b>permit</b> to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E
