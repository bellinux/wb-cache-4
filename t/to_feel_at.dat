5|$|Test cricket {{returned}} from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia. Collins, also a selector, {{was one of}} six AIF XI players to make his début in the First Test of that series. The First Test was played on Collins's home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home, scoring 70 and 104. Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920–1921 series, Collins made 557 runs {{at an average of}} 61.88.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home there.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, she {{appeared}} opposite Salvatori in the mafia film Vento del sud, {{and played the}} wife of Maurizio Arena in Luigi Zampa's Il magistrato. Cardinale also starred opposite Pietro Germi in his crime film Un maledetto imbroglio, an important assignment for her in mastering the craft of acting while learning <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease {{in front of the}} camera. Cardinale considered it to have been her first real test as an actress. She then played the role of Maria in Ralph Thomas's British film Upstairs and Downstairs, which starred Michael Craig and Anne Heywood. In her early roles, she was usually dubbed, as producers considered her voice too hoarse.|$|E
500|$|Champion has {{explained}} that Nelson's production style was liberating {{and allowed the}} band <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease during the recording of Parachutes (many songs from the album often featured slow tempos). The ensuing album was [...] "a record's worth of moody and atmospheric tunes". As {{a nod to the}} moods created by the album, Champion has compared the song lyrics to the 1972 song [...] "Perfect Day" [...] by American rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed, stating that the [...] "lyrics are beautiful and they're really, really happy, but the music is really, really sad. It's that kind of thing, where you can create [...] moods through the music and lyrics." ...|$|E

I wanted him <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II." ...|$|E
500|$|International {{productions}} {{have opened}} to similarly ambivalent critical reception. The West End production opened to {{a slightly more}} upbeat response. The majority of critics have appreciated the spectacle of the lavish production, and the [...] "powerhouse" [...] performances of actors in {{the roles of the}} two witches. However, contemporaries have characterized the production as overblown, occasionally preachy, and suffering from more hype than heart. Although Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "at times ... a bit of a mess," [...] he praised Holzman's script, described Kenneth Posner's lighting design as [...] "magical" [...] and lauded Menzel's Elphaba and Helen Dallimore's Glinda. Michael Billington of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and remarked on the competence of all the lead actors; however, he complained that Wicked was [...] "all too typical of the modern Broadway musical: efficient, knowing and highly professional but more like a piece of industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind". Paul Taylor of The Independent gave extremely negative remarks to his viewing of the London production, calling the attempt at topical political allegory [...] "well-meaning but also melodramatic, incoherent and dreadfully superficial" [...] while deploring the acting, songs and book, concluding that [...] "the production manages <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> once overblown and empty." ...|$|E
500|$|Zur {{typically}} {{is brought}} in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more [...] "flexible" [...] process. He finds that it is [...] "crucial" [...] for him {{to play a game}} before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music [...] "intuitively", rather than {{spending a lot of time}} planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects that he would like to work on in the future that he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, Rhodes scored 2,094 runs at {{an average}} of 40.26, which was to remain his second highest run {{aggregate}} and average for an English cricket season, and took 141 wickets. Sidney Rogerson believed that this season marked the completion of his transformation into a batsman. This view was supported by Wisden, which judged that he had [...] "now become such an exceptionally good batsman that the regret one used <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> his ever giving his mind to run getting has lost its force." [...] He played in four of the five Tests against Australia in 1909; [...] his omission from the second Test was later described as an error of judgement by the editor of Wisden, one of many selectorial blunders as England lost the series two games to one. Rhodes scored 168 runs {{at an average}} of 33.60, and took 11 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.00. In the first Test, he had a quiet time, scoring an unbeaten 15, batting at number eight, and bowling only one over. Recalled for the third Test, Rhodes bowled a spell in which four wickets were captured for seven runs, before being hit for four fours in one over by Trumper. His first innings figures were four for 38 and he took another two wickets for 44 runs in the second innings. In the fourth Test, Wisden believed that Rhodes alone bowled well on the second day, taking five for 83. Although moved up the order to bat at number five, he scored just five runs in the match. In the final Test, he batted at number three and scored two fifties, 66 and 54, adding 104 in the first innings with C. B. Fry and another 61 to save the game with the same batsman in the second.|$|E

All the poor and destitute in the country, orphans, widowers, and childless men, maimed people and cripples, and all who are diseased, go to those houses, and are provided with every kind of help, and doctors examine their diseases.

He was not a man <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home in an atmosphere of Puritanism, and on 3 March 1644 he fled to Oxford, carrying with him the secret of Paulet's treachery.

His {{paternal}} grandmother (also born in Passaic) was one of eight children born to a self-made Polish Jew who had supplied coal {{to the city of}} Passaic. Heinze memorialized his grandmother in an article he wrote for The Jewish Daily Forward shortly after she {{died at the age of}} 101; he described her as a flamboyant, stylish, and impeccably dressed woman, and he recalled that after his grandfather (her husband of 60 years) had died, she [...] "kept on going, honestly confessing her loneliness but unflaggingly maintaining her enthusiasm for life and for us." [...] He quoted her as frequently giving him the reminder, [...] "We are 100% Americans, dear, always remember that!" [...] Heinze has a close relationship with his parents; in his acknowledgements of his second book, he wrote, [...] "I have been blessed with extraordinarily devoted parents who enabled me, as a child, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home in the world." [...] His mother, he said, is a woman of [...] "gentle disposition, sensitivity to human qualities that others overlook, vivacious imagination, love of art, and whimsical sense of humor," [...] and his father he described as a man of [...] "great loyalty, heartfelt devotion, and frequent praise [...] helped me set my sights high and pick myself up when fallen low." ...|$|E
