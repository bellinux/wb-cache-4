5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Naples, <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.|$|E
