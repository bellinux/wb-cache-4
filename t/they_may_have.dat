5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{played a role in}} respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers.

5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities.

5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> novel modes of action.
