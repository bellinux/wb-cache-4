50|$|A few {{countries}} have created statutes {{in relation to}} letters of credit. For example, most jurisdictions in the United States (U.S.) have adopted Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). These statutes are designed {{to work with the}} rules of practice including UCP and ISP98. These rules of practice are incorporated into the <b>transaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>agreement</b> of the parties. The latest version of the UCP is the UCP600 effective July 1, 2007. Since the UCP are not laws, parties have to include them into their arrangements as normal contractual provisions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of land rental market {{development}} on the efficiency of labor allocation and land utilization in rural China. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} shadow wage of a rent-in household with limited off-farm opportunities will increase with the development of a land rental market for households, a statistical comparison between the shadow wage and the estimated market wage was conducted. The results showed that the shadow wage for both rent-in households and non-rent-in households was significantly lower than the market wage, but that the wage for the rent-in households was statistically higher than that for non-rent-in households in Fenghua and Deqing, the two counties surveyed in this study. In addition, the estimated marginal product of farmland for rent-in households was statistically higher than the actual land rent that those households paid, while a null hypothesis that the actual rental fee accepted by rent-out households is equivalent to the marginal product of farmland for those households was not rejected in Fenghua county where land <b>transactions</b> <b>by</b> mutual <b>agreement</b> were more prevalent. These results indicate that the development of the land rental market facilitates the efficiency of labor allocation and farmland utilization in rural China.

50|$|The {{switches}} officially {{began on}} September 3, 1994, when CBS affiliate WJW-TV {{became the first}} station involved in the New World agreement to switch its affiliation to Fox; the CBS affiliation in Cleveland consequently moved to the market's Fox charter affiliate WOIO (channel 19). Sister station WDAF-TV followed suit on September 12, trading affiliations with original Fox affiliate KSHB-TV (channel 41; New World had finalized its acquisition of KSAZ-TV and WDAF only {{three days before the}} latter switched from NBC to Fox). The majority of the New World stations switched their affiliations to Fox between December 1994 and August 1995 (WGHP and WBRC respectively did not become Fox stations until September 1, 1995, and September 1, 1996, due to their existing affiliation contracts with ABC). The affiliation changes formally concluded on September 1, 1996, when WBRC officially joined Fox as an owned-and-operated station; however, an additional affiliation <b>transaction</b> caused <b>by</b> an <b>agreement</b> spurred <b>by</b> the Fox-New World deal occurred on February 1, 1997, when upstart WJXX (channel 25) in Orange Park, Florida, signed on as the new ABC affiliate for the Jacksonville market, replacing WJKS (channel 17, now WCWJ), which became a WB affiliate under the callsign WJWB.|$|R

40|$|My {{professor}} on the Law of Personal Status began {{one of his}} invariably dry lectures {{with the}} words 2 ̆ 2 [m]atrimony is an institution that concludes in death or divorce. 2 ̆ 2 It struck me then as a terribly unromantic {{way of looking at}} something wonderful. For all I know, the professor may have been as romantic as I was. His point was that lawyers, as designers of social relationships, must look beyond the moment of exhilarating consensus when those relationships are created to that inevitable momentusually quite rancorous-when, in one way or another, they are undergoing stress or are ending. Domestic law provides compulsory institutions for resolving conflicts about commitments and relationships. To a large extent, international law does not. Whether an international transaction comprises a single event or a large number of events linked in complex and continuing legal and economic relationships, the responsible attorney must plan for the resolution of disputes. Inevitably, most of the efforts of negotiators are going to be directed toward shaping the substantive <b>transaction.</b> <b>By</b> the time <b>agreement</b> is reached, negotiators are often exhausted and, as the champagne is uncorked, they may pay relatively little attention to dispute resolution. More often than not, negotiators will simply jam an off-the-shelf dispute resolution clause into the miscellaneous chapter {{at the end of the}} agreement. One indication of how automatic this has sometimes been is some arbitration clauses in important post-war contracts still referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice as the back-up appointment authority, despite the fact that the Permanent Court had long since ceased to exist...|$|R
