5|$|Later {{studies with}} the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how Andromeda Galaxy's spiral {{structure}} in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above.

5|$|The larvae <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> {{from the}} eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least}} one species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{activity}} between infective juveniles (IJ) of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> directly from cadavers onto either a sand or agar substrate {{compared with those}} emerging from a cadaver into water and then being placed on the same substrate are known to occur. Differences between S. carpocapsae IJ <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> directly from a cadaver vs. those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> from a cadaver and held in water were further elucidated. Dispersed and non-dispersed IJ from a cadaver were compared with those held in water between two time periods designated as early- (first two days) or late-emerging IJ (seventh day). A significantly greater proportion of early-emerging IJ from the cadaver treatment dispersed, compared with late-emerging IJ from a cadaver or either group of emerging IJ held in aqueous suspension. Moreover, IJ from cadavers were more infectious than those from the aqueous suspensions, and IJ that dispersed were less infectious than those that did not disperse. IJ <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> early were mostly males, whereas those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> late were mostly females. For the non-dispersed IJ, most <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> early were males, and those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> later were females, but among dispersing IJ, {{there was no difference}} in sex ratio between early- and late-emerging nematodes...|$|R

25|$|In total {{there are}} about 70,000 pot sherds {{collected}} at Oxkintok, and 38 complete vessels. The chronology is largely based on pottery types <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> and die out in Mayan culture.

25|$|The {{relative}} {{number of}} parasitoids decreases with increasing gall volume. And the closer the gall {{is to the}} ground, the greater {{the total number of}} adults <b>that</b> <b>emerge.</b> Thus, it seems more effective for a female D. rosae to induce larger galls on lower branches of the shrubs to increase the survival probability of the offspring. The distances from margins of shrubs, however, affects neither the parasitoid ratio of galls nor the volume of the galls.|$|E

25|$|While imagination, memory, {{literary}} imagination, and intropathy are faculties comprised in the mind, {{which is}} ultimately enfleshed by the body, heremenutica counseling theory states {{that they are}} faculties <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> in dialogue {{as part of the}} process of understanding and relating to others. These various conversations become a series of ongoing, multiple conversations humans have with their selves, others, and the world. In other words, the lives of human beings and their experiences manifest as an everlasting, ongoing dialogical process, or conversation.|$|E

For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.|$|E

Ajaan Lee emphasized his metaphor of Buddhist practice as a skill, and reintroduced the Buddha's idea of skillfullness — acting in ways <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from having trained the mind and heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{new century}} has brought new {{dynamics}} {{to the practice}} of visual performance. To be a VJ previously had largely meant a process of self-invention in isolation from others: the term was not widely known. Then through the rise of internet adoption, having access to other practitioners very became the norm, and virtual communities quickly formed. The sense of collective then translated from the virtual world onto physical spaces. This becomes apparent through the numerous festivals <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> all over Europe with strong focus on VJing.|$|E
25|$|In optics, {{a virtual}} image {{is an image}} formed when the {{outgoing}} rays from a point on an object always diverge.

In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines. Virtual images are located by tracing the real rays <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to a perceived point of origin.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Plasmodium {{involves}} several distinct stages in the insect and vertebrate hosts. In infected mosquitoes, parasites in the salivary gland are called sporozoites. When the mosquito bites a vertebrate host, sporozoites are injected into the host with the saliva. From there, the sporozoites enter the bloodstream and are transported to the liver, where they invade and replicate within hepatocytes. At this point, some species of Plasmodium can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite which can remain in the liver for many years. The parasites <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from infected hepatocytes are called merozoites, and these return to the blood to infect red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem.

Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.|$|E

25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour.

Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
25|$|The {{games of}} {{previous}} millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa {{at the behest}} of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle. The patterns <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.|$|E
