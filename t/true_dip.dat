50|$|A {{dip slope}} is a {{topographic}} (geomorphic) surface which slopes {{in the same}} direction, and often by the same amount, as the <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> or apparent dip of the underlying strata. A dip slope consists of the upper surface of a resistant layer of rock, often called caprock, that is commonly only slightly lowered and reduced in steepness by erosion. Dip slopes form the backslopes of cuestas, homoclinal ridges, hogbacks, and flatirons. The frontslopes of such ridges consist of either an escarpment, a steep slope, or perhaps even a line of cliffs. Generally, cuestas and homoclinal ridges are asymmetrical in that their dip slopes are less steep than their escarpments. In the case of hogbacks and flatirons, the dip of the rocks is so steep that their dip slope approaches the escarpment in their steepness.|$|E
30|$|The {{discrepancy}} between aftershock results and field observations {{can be explained}} by their different depths. The field observations are only for the surface breaks while the aftershocks occurred at depth. Also, the predominant strike-slip mechanism from teleseismic inversion could be an artifact of assuming a constant low dip angle, and the <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> angle in the northern segment could be high as manifested by the dip angles of focal mechanisms (event Nos. 1, 7, 9, 10, 11). Better finite fault modeling involving InSAR, GPS, and strong motion records should be able to clarify the discrepancy.|$|E

[...] The analysis of the data from this experiment involved producing 2 D and 3 D seismic images from the broadside shots, and producing a 2 D section from the end-on-south shots. Also, an amplitude versus offset analysis (AVO) was completed on deep crustal reflections using the end-on-south shots. The seismic images have been interpreted in terms of the regional geological structures and correlated with the results from regional seismic reflection and refraction surveys. [...] It is determined that the quality of the low fold 2 D sections produced using the wide-angle shots compares favourably with that of the high fold regional lines. The interpretation of the 3 D volume was problematical, leading to recommendations for better 3 D survey design: however, three horizons have been mapped and time structure maps display their 3 D orientation. It is determined that information on the <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> of reflectors along the regional lines can be provided using the relatively inexpensive broadside shots. The AVO results fail to provide conclusive results for changes in Poisson's ratio across any of the major reflecting interfaces {{in the area of the}} broadside experiment in central Newfoundland. If the statisical trends can be trusted, a decrease in Poisson's ratio at the top of the lower crust is indicated, however a firm value cannot be placed on this decrease. The AVO results are ambiguous probably because of seismic scattering due to a high degree of lateral inhomogeneity in the crystalline crust...|$|E
40|$|Craters {{cross-cut}} by faults {{are used}} as markers to obtain fault geometric and kinematic properties. Assuming that the shape of these craters was originally circular, {{it is possible to}} measure the horizontal and vertical components of fault displacement as well as the slip trend. By applying trigonometric relations, slip plunge, displacement magnitude, fault <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> and fault rake can be derived from the observed values. An example application of this method on craters faulted by lobate scarps on Mercury shows that most of these inferred reverse faults have moderate oblique-slip trends. Moreover, the derived dips of thrusts vary over a wide range of angles. Some preliminary results in terms of fault rake compared with fault dip, strike and latitude are presented together with a pilot study to test and discriminate global tectonic models suggested for the evolution of Mercury. The possibility of estimating quantitative fault parameters through remotely sensed data provides significant assistance in the structural characterization of faults on planetary surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Starting from a 2 -D {{interpolation}} scheme presented {{elsewhere in}} this report, we develop an algorithm for interpolation of 3 -D data.

INTRODUCTION Elsewhere in this report (Claerbout, 1992) a 2 -D interpolation scheme based on a mono-planewave assumption is described. To fill in a gap between two traces, a spatial prediction method is {{used to determine the}} dip, and the missing traces are constructed by combining the two known traces from either end of the gap, with time shifts and weights appropriate to the estimated dip and the various distances. In three dimensions, the location of a trace to be filled in by interpolation will not always lie on a line drawn between some pair of input traces. Thus while it was sufficient in 2 -D interpolation to find the apparent dip b [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Microbialites {{can have}} complex morphologies that {{preserve}} clues to ancient microbial ecology. However, extracting and interpreting these clues is challenging due {{to both the}} complexity of microbial structures and the difficulties of connecting morphology to microbial processes. Fenestrate microbialites from the 2521 – 3 Ma Gamohaan Formation, South Africa, have intricate structures composed of three distinct microbial structures: steeply dipping supports (surfaces defined by organic inclusions), more shallowly dipping supports with diffuse organic inclusions below them, and draping laminae. In polished slabs, shallowly dipping supports with diffuse organic inclusions show apparent dips from 27 ° to 60 °, and supports without associated zones of diffuse inclusions dip 75 ° to 88 °, which suggests a distinction between support types based on orientation. However, dips exposed in polished slabs are apparent dips, and three-dimensional analysis is required for analysis of <b>true</b> <b>dips.</b> Through the Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), we used locally developed software that controls a three-dimensional environment with head and hand tracking (an ‘‘immersive environment’’) to visualize and interpret virtual microbialite data sets. Immersive environments have not penetrated into standard scientific work processes (‘‘workflows’’) due to their high costs, steep learning curves, and low productivity for users. By contrast, our suite of software tools allowed us to develop a personalize...|$|R

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar {{data have}} been collected {{from a number of}} sites in order to investigate the shallow sub-surface. The purpose was to investigate, through active participation, the benefit that GPR can have to elements of the BGS Core Programme and to explore ways that GPR can be used more widely in the future. Field data were collected mainly with a 250 MHz Noggin GPR system manufactured by Sensors and Software Limited, but some additional data were also collected using frequencies of 50 and 100 MHz. Good results were achieved for mapping fractures, characterising an aggregate deposit and for locating infrastructure including, tunnels, voids, steel reinforcing bars and capping for a mineshaft. The use of new equipment that collects data rapidly was found to be especially useful for creating three-dimensional blocks of data. Three-dimensional displays enable artefacts in the data to be identified and for the <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> of structures to be measured. Surveys were less successful when characterising chalk and estimating the thickness of buried channels where the depth of the channels was found to be too deep for high frequency GPR. GPR is a powerful tool for investigating the shallow sub-surface when used in the appropriate environment. It is therefore important that BGS Programme Managers and project leaders {{should be aware of the}} potential of GPR and be prepared to utilise it when devising new projects. This is most likely to be achieved through active consultation with geophysicists during the planning phase of a project...|$|E
40|$|Rocks of White River (Oligocene) age {{have been}} known {{for many years to}} {{constitute}} numerous isolated buttes and mesas in the northwest corner of South Dakota, but no detailed study of their character and structural relations had been made until 1911, when, during an examination of the lignite area of that country, the writer had occasion to study the relation of the younger rocks to those containing lignite beds. Todd, in 1895, recognized the White River formation in the Slim Buttes and called attention to the area in the following language: 3. Miocene beds, both White River and Loup Fork, with characteristic fossils, have been found overlying wide areas of the Laramie north of the Black Hills, covering quite deeply most of Harding County, with thin outliers over the north half of Butte County and south half of Ewing. In the Short Pine hills and Slim Buttes these deposits exhibit a depth of 200 to 400 feet with characteristic fossil features closely resembling those of the White River region. 4. An area of disturbance was found in the north half of Slim Buttes in northeast Harding County covering perhaps 20 to 25 square miles. This consists of sharp folds, including the Laramie and White River beds, with throws of perhaps 100 feet and dips of 25 degrees. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to show that the inclination of beds described above, as well as those exposed at several other localities in the Slim Buttes, is not a <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> due to a dynamic disturbance but is cross-bedding due to the peculiar manner of the accumulation of the White River formation...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{methods have}} been used in {{sedimentary}} environment for almost 80 years. During that time, exploration geophysicists have developed a number of techniques to handle specific aspects of working in sedimentary areas. This is not the case for studies in the hardrock environment, where significantly less time and money have been invested on seismic investigations. Therefore, there is still a need to develop the right techniques appropriate for working in hardrock environments. The research presented here, covers aspects of acquisition, processing and interpretation in hardrock environments. A cost-effective alternative for two-dimensional data acquisition is presented. Acquisition parameters are also discussed and recommendations for future work are given. The main effort of this thesis, however, was to find appropriate processing methods to address some of the different problems present in datasets acquired in the hardrock environment. Comparison of two computer programs for first arrival seismic tomography was performed in order to find the most suitable one for processing crooked line geometries. Three-dimensional pre-stack depth migration was also tested to find a detailed near-surface image. A processing method geared to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio was applied to the dataset with the lowest signal amplitudes {{to improve the quality of}} the stack. Finally, cross-dip analysis and corrections were performed on two of the three datasets included in this thesis. Cross-dip analysis was also applied as an interpretation tool to provide the information needed for estimation of the <b>true</b> <b>dip</b> of some of the reflectors related to geological structures. The results presented in this thesis indicate that cross-dip analysis and corrections are one of the most powerful tools for processing and interpretation in the presence of complex geology. Therefore, it is recommended to include this method as a standard step in the processing and interpretation sequence of data acquired in hardrock environments...|$|E
30|$|Planform {{architecture}} {{elements of}} meandering channels {{are shown in}} Fig.  3 (Lin et al. 2017), which demonstrates a single meandering belt, showing the migration channels during river evolution. Based on the primary and secondary flows in a meandering channel, erosion (deposition) occurs along the concave (convex) bank (Abad and Garcia 2009; Hubbard et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011) and {{is associated with a}} dip change from concave to convex bank orientation. The direction of internal dip parallel to the meandering loop axis is the largest and named the ‘true dip’, whereas the direction of internal dip is away from the meandering loop axis, which is known as the ‘apparent dip’ (<b>true</b> dip[*]>[*]apparent <b>dip)</b> (Fig.  3 B–B′ profile). Additionally, when the internal dip sets change direction, it may indicate that the channel pattern converts into another. Furthermore, the riffle zone is located in the bend inflection where one-way transverse circulation transforms into parallel circulation (the down-cut ability of parallel circulation is weak), which usually carries sand and results in thin sand body accumulation.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. One of the major goals of seismic data processing is to produce an accurate image of the subsurface of the earth. Unfortunately, when dipping events or diffractions are present, or when velocities vary laterally, the normal-moveout (NMO) correction applied in common midpoint (CMP) stacking fails to convert even primary events on non-zero offset traces to <b>true</b> zero offset. <b>Dip</b> moveout (DMO) is a process that converts non-zerooffset data to true zero offset after NMO has been applied. Direct comparison of compressional (P) and shear (S) wave data in a fractured reservoir can show whether amplitude anomalies on the P-wave section are associated with the presence of gas or change of lithology. The P-wave and S-wave data selected for this study were shot in Burleson County, Texas. After processing, the P-wave and S-wave sections were interpreted. No gas-related DHf (direct hydrocarbon indicator) was seen in both sections. Comparison of both sections before and after DMO shows that DMO has helped imaging the fractures in the Austin Chalk and provided a clear image of the subsurface after migrating the DMO data. Major reflectors such as the Pecan Gap, "Top-of-the-Austin-Chalk", "Bottom-of-theAustin-Chalk", and Buda correlate well with seismic events on the synthetic seismogram which was generated from the sonic log of the Lancier Brinckman # 1 well. The difference in depth between the sonic log and the P-wave seismic section is small. The sonic log depths are deeper than the P-wave seismic section depths. The top and bottom of the Austin Chalk reflectors on both sections display laterally varying amplitudes (surface locations 55 to 68). This region coincides with the high-oil production zone (fractured zone) ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 -D) seismic reflection surveying {{is accepted}} as the preferred method for imaging complex geology for proving and developing commercial {{oil and gas}} fields. However, the cost of 3 -D seismic recording and processing is substantial and often can be as expensive {{as the cost of}} production drilling. This is particularly the case for land oil field development, where the cost of 3 -D surveying is often unacceptably high. Such high costs also restrict its application in coal exploration, where 2 -D seismic methods have long been accepted. During the early 1980 's, a low fold technique for recording land 3 -D data was devised which offered significant cost savings. The technique was adapted by the author for land 3 -D surveying over coal fields. Inherent in the technique was a requirement that the data must have a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is not generally the case in land surveying due to the presence of strong source generated surface wave noise. A further major impediment to the technique was its inability to perform an acceptable stacking velocity analysis because of the low number of seismic traces generated. This thesis defines three data collection and processing advancements in low fold 3 -D technology which go some way towards resolving these impediments. The first advancement is a method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked seismic data, and consists of a Radon-based transform which stacks shot domain data along a curved trajectory, thereby attenuating surface waves on swath recorded data. This transform is termed the 'Radial Transform' of 3 -D data. The second advancement is a statics method to improve the stacked image from a low number of input traces. The method uses the concept that if both the reflected and refracted waves pass through a weathering layer with very similar travel paths, then static corrections to remove the ++effects of weathering variations on the refraction travel times would be very similar to those required for the reflections. This method, which was patented, is used equally for both 2 -D and 3 -D field data, and is regularly used in high resolution seismic processing for coal at Curtin University. The third advancement resolves the problem of azimuthal variation of stacking velocities. By predicting the <b>true</b> reflector <b>dip</b> and its azimuth, apparent dip can be included in the normal moveout equation, which is named the Generalized Moveout equation. The requirement for an azimuthally dependent stacking velocity is then no longer an impediment in low fold 3 -D processing of coal data. After developing these transforms and applying them to synthetic data, they were tested with success on modelled field data. All field data used within this thesis were either recorded in the field by the author, or were produced with a physical modelling system, which was built by the author at the University of Houston and later at Curtin University. Results indicate that the procedures described in this thesis enable the low fold 3 -D technique {{to be used as a}} viable method for recording seismic data when survey economics are a major issue. Furthermore, all three advancements are suitable for application in conventional two dimensional (2 -D) and swath seismic surveying...|$|R
