25|$|The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK) layout, {{also known}} as the American Simplified Keyboard (ASK) layout, is the best-known {{alternative}} to QWERTY. It was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English, and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout has them in numerical order. The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard has numerous properties designed to increase <b>typing</b> <b>speed,</b> decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a modest 4% average advantage to the end user in <b>typing</b> <b>speed.</b> The most prominent property involves concentrating the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest, thus having 70% of typing done in the home row (compared to 32% in QWERTY).|$|E
25|$|Shai Coleman {{developed}} the Colemak keyboard layout {{in order to}} make typing easier by placing the most frequent letters under the strongest fingers.

25|$|PSK31's {{symbol rate}} of 31.25Hz {{was chosen because}} a normal <b>typing</b> <b>speed</b> of about 50 words per minute {{requires}} a bit rate of about 32 bits per second, and specifically because 31.25Hz could easily be derived from the 8kHz sample rate used in many DSP systems, including those used in the computer sound cards commonly used for PSK31 operation (31.25Hz is 8kHz divided by 256, and so {{can be derived from}} 8kHz by halving the frequency eight times in succession).|$|E
25|$|Although {{thorough}} {{training and}} practice {{are required to}} use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast <b>typing</b> <b>speed</b> availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS.|$|E
50|$|Several {{alternatives}} to QWERTY {{have been developed}} over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic. Nevertheless, none have seen widespread adoption, {{partly due to the}} sheer dominance of available keyboards and training. Although some studies have suggested that some of these may allow for faster <b>typing</b> <b>speeds,</b> many other studies have failed to do so, and many of the studies claiming improved <b>typing</b> <b>speeds</b> were severely methodologically flawed or deliberately biased, such as the studies administered by Dvorak himself before and after World War II. Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits, and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevant - even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar <b>typing</b> <b>speeds</b> to QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training on whichever keyboard you already use.|$|R
