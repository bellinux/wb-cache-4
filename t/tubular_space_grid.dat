40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} main trends in the development of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures. In order to reach the purpose it is necessary to conduct a review of the known structural concepts, nodal connections and specifics of the <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures and to make conclusions on feasibility improvement of the considered structural concepts that make it possible to develop new solutions without disadvantages residing in the analogues. Analysis of papers written by foreign and national scientists and devoted to theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of stress-strain state, influence of different factors on it and geometrical optimization and designing of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures has been conducted in order to achieve the objectives. <b>Space</b> <b>grid</b> structures and, in particular, flat double-layer grid and most frequent nodes have been studied in the paper. The paper contains a short review of the history on development of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures. It has been found that a rapid development of structural designs was caused by scientific and technical progress and, in particular, improvement of physical and mechanical properties of materials, development of calculation methods, application of software systems for simulating behavior of the structure under load, which significantly increased the calculation accuracy and reduced complexity of design. It has been also established that main parameters that have influence on effectiveness of a structural design are geometric dimensions of its modular elements, ratio of its depth to the span. The world experience on development of connection components has been studied in the paper. The paper presents general classification of nodal connections. Main advantages and disadvantages of existing <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures are highlighted and it allows to determine possible methods for their improvement. Theoretical research has permitted to establish that the main direction of spatial grid structures improvement consists in development of new node connection types. Several methods for node improvement have been proposed while taking into account the obtained results. </p...|$|R

40|$|A method {{combined}} curvature mode {{difference and}} wavelet transformation {{was used to}} determine the damage location of space gird structure. This method considered the curvature mode difference of pre and post damage as the wavelet transform analysis signal. Moreover, these signals were analyzed by wavelet transform using wavelet function db 3. As the wavelet transform coefficient occur sudden change, the damage locations of links will be obtained. In this paper, square pyramid <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structure, orthogonal <b>space</b> truss structure, three way latticed grid and honeycomb triangular pyramid grid structure will be analyzed using this method to identify single damage and multi-damage location. The solutions from numerical simulations show that this method can take effective identification of single damage location and multi-damage location of square pyramid <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structure by the first mode condition.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} have {{stressed the importance}} of the role of interaction in the language learning process (Kramsch, 1986; Van Lier, 1996; Ellis, 2000; Walsh, 2011). However, studies on classroom interaction between foreign language (FL) teachers and a group of FL learners are rare, because they are multifaceted and complex. Few techniques or observation systems are able to track the development of student-teacher interactions over time. A potentially powerful tool for researching time series is the State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> technique (Lewis, Lamey & Douglas, 1999 & Hollenstein, 2007). A State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> is a two-dimensional representation of a dynamic system, in which the cells represent all possible states of a system. State <b>Space</b> <b>Grids</b> are suitable for visualizing the dynamic system, and analyzing measures such as cell range, dispersion, cell visits, cell transitions and duration. The present study sets out to explore if and how sequential teacher-group interactions develop dynamically over time, and to reveal successful or unsuccessful verbal teacher scaffolding. We used teacher questions in relation to FL learner utterances as our unit of analysis, and applied the State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> technique to study these two dimensions together. Coding categories for the system dimensions include teacher clarification, elicitation, elaboration, referential questions and display questions (Lyster, 2007, Dalton-Puffer, 2007) in relation to length and quality of FL learner responses. We analyzed video data from five different naturalistic Dutch secondary EFL classrooms. We will present some preliminary results and outline practical applications of the State-Space Grid for teacher education purposes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{extensive}} work {{in various}} domains {{pointed out the}} bidimensionality {{of the concept of}} satisfaction, it is still commonly measured with semantic differential scales, associated with an implicit assumption of unidimensionality. The objective of this research is to fill this gap between theoretical findings and methodological practices by importing a tool from psychological researches: the Evaluative <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> (Larsen et al., 2009). This grid provides a single item measure of positivity and negativity through a 25 cells grid. In an empirical study, we compare the construct and predictive validity of this tool to the traditional semantic differential scales. Results show that satisfaction measured with Evaluative <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> offer a better predictive validity of behavioral intentions, capturing separately indifferent and mixed evaluations...|$|R

40|$|In {{variable}} <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography {{the underground}} velocity distribution is parameterized with model cells of different sizes. This method can simultaneously {{take into account}} the spatially varying resolution inherent in most datasets. E. g., due to experimental design or logistic constraints, the shallow and deep subsurface velocity distribution may be very differently determined by the available data. The variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography and regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography are similar in most other aspects. There are two main differences between the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method and the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method. First, ray segments calculated in the forward model cells should be divided into the larger cells of the inversion model. Second, the smoothness constraint equations needed to inhibit wild velocity variations need to be modified where the cells change in size. In a synthetic checkerboard reconstruction test with differently sized checkers the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method recovers the small and large checkers better than the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method in both two and three-dimensional test cases. For a real dataset, the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method distinguishes two low velocity zones better than the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method. Finally, it can be concluded that when the effort is spent to identify the regions in a model with best data coverage, the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method can produce velocity images with higher fidelity than when a uniform cell size is used. Especially, in many cases this method can enhance the fidelity of the shallow subsurface velocity distribution. In addition, variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography can reduce the underdetermined regions in an inverse problem when the data coverage is irregular...|$|R
