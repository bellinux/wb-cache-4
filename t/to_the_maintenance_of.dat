5|$|Where {{it lives}} {{alongside}} the blue wildebeest, {{the two species}} can hybridise, and this {{is regarded as a}} potential threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds {{but by the end of}} the nineteenth century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sana and Operation Southern Move {{established}} the 51%–49% distribution of territory {{controlled by the}} ARBiH and HVO {{on the one hand}} and the VRS on the other, as envisaged in plans put forward by the Contact Group. The ARBiH, HVO and HV ultimately consented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the ceasefire of 12 October. According to British historian Marko Attila Hoare, their acquiescence was secured following massive diplomatic pressure from the West, and the alleged threat of US airstrikes against the ARBiH if it breached the ceasefire. The Bosnian War ended with the acceptance of the Dayton Agreement by all sides in November 1995.|$|E
5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E

5|$|Disliking Royal Doulton's tiling designs, {{and with}} her time and money {{increasingly}} devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the Watts Gallery, Mary Watts by now was losing interest in the memorial and by 1930 had handed complete control to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee. Neither Mary Watts nor the Committee had added new names to the list originally proposed by Watts, and thus there were no proposed names more recent than 1904, with the vast majority {{dating back to the}} 19th century. The Committee decided that rather than use these by now dated records, they would request suggestions from relevant public bodies. The British Medical Association was asked to suggest brave medical professionals, the Metropolitan Police Service to suggest brave police officers, and, in light of the park's name, the General Post Office was asked to suggest heroic postal workers. The Metropolitan Police suggested the names of three officers who had died while rescuing others, and on 15 October 1930 tablets to the three officers, manufactured by Royal Doulton to a similar design to their previous tablets, were added to the second row and unveiled by Hastings Lees-Smith, the Postmaster-General, in a ceremony also commemorating the 50th anniversary of the opening of the park, attended by Mary Watts and many police officers and relatives of those being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I {{the units}} that had been raised {{as part of the}} AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the Citizens Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men {{in the event of a}} war, of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizens Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|E

5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs and}} calls of antbirds are {{generally}} composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family {{is one of}} the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the loudsong and the softsong. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.|$|E
