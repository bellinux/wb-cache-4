40|$|We {{report a}} <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{refractive}} index sensor with a visible metamaterial absorber. The visible metamaterial absorber {{consisting of a}} silver dendritic/dielectric/metal structure shows multiple absorption peaks. By incorporating a gain material (rhodamine B) into the dielectric layer, the maximal magnitude of the absorption peak can be improved by about 30 %. As the metamaterial absorber is sensitive to the refractive index of glucose solutions, it can function as a sensor that quickly responds to variations of the refractive index of the liquid. Meanwhile, since the response is presented via color changes, it can be clearly observed by <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> Further experiments have confirmed that the sensor can be used repeatedly...|$|R
30|$|Curiosity {{and desire}} to see {{microscopic}} world have leaded {{the invention of the}} optical microscope. Thanks to the optical microscope, the small structures that had been invisible to <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> could be seen. Modern biology and medical science where large portions are based on the observation of micro-objects such as cells and bacteria have been developed with the advance in the optical microscope. With fluorescent materials, optical microscopes became more useful and essential for the decades, but there is still a fundamental question how to achieve the spatial resolution below diffraction limit.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reliable}} colorimetric detection {{system based on}} anti-aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is proposed for rapid detection of Hg 2 + with high selectivity and sensitivity. O-phenylenediamine (OPD) can cause the aggregation of AuNPs due to formation of the strong covalent NH-Au bond, and then induce color change of the AuNPs solution from red to blue. However, {{in the presence of}} Hg 2 +, OPD prefers to combine with Hg 2 + rather than AuNPs resulting in inhibition of the color change. Based on the anti-aggregation mechanism, Hg 2 + can be detected by observing the color change of AuNPs solution containing OPD. After optimization, the selectivity of this Hg 2 + detection system by <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> and UV-vis spectra is excellent comparing with other ions. The limit of the detection CLOD) is 0. 1 mu M by <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> and 5. 0 nM by UV-vis spectroscopy, which is lower than the mercury toxic level (10 nM) defined by US Environmental Protection Agency. It's a good linear relationship between A(520) /A(680) and Hg 2 +. concentration from 0. 01 mu M to 2. 0 mu M, which is used for the quantitative assay of Hg 2 +. The applicability of our detection system is also verified by analysis of Hg 2 + in tap water and lake water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
