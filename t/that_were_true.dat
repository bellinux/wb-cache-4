Chiesa also called the instrument the colascione. Gottfried Finger suggested that it was used in Boheman musical circles. Francis William Galpin thought that the earliest versions of the colascione were initially called the Guitarra morisca. If <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> {{it would take the}} history of the instrument back into the 13th Century, when it was illustrated as a smaller instrument in the Cantigas de Santa Maria.|$|E
2500|$|Bibby {{details the}} {{construction}} of the wall and deduces that [...] "the wall was built of a coral like conglomerate called farush," [...] which to Bibby [...] "felt wrong because of the fluctuating level of sea water." [...] He stated; [...] "If anywhere there was a subkha today there should have been water even as recently as 2000 years ago. If <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> then this wall (at Uqair) could not be as old as the wall at Thaj." [...] (Bibby, p.324). [...] (The walls of Thaj, another ruined city near Qatif, were built during the same period as Gerrha - the Greek period.) [...] But as Bibby concludes ... "in the cities of the Greek period on Bahrain and the temple of towns of the Seleucid on Failaka (an island off the coast of Kuwait once thought to be a Hellenistic foundry of coins) farush was never used. [...] The walls there were made of quarried limestone." [...] (Bibby, p.324.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the idea}} that newly {{isolated}} human genes of unknown function could prove useful for drug development was widely criticized. Haseltine's experience with HIV taught him that knowledge of the genome without prior knowledge of function was useful and had led {{to the discovery of}} new and useful drug targets and new and effective drugs. Haseltine argued that if one new human gene were discovered, the techniques of modern biology would allow its natural function and potential medical use identified. If <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> for one gene, then why not all the human genes? New tools had been developed that allowed what had been tedious hard work of gene isolation and characterization to be replaced by highly automated instruments and the data regarding the structure, tissue and cell location and the results of functional tests to be stored and easily accessed using advanced computer technologies. He summarized these views [...] with the statement [...] "Genomics is not necessarily Genetics". It was not until the Human Genome Science approach was validated by its own work and [...] the work of its partners that it was ultimately adopted by the scientific community. Today, the approach pioneered by Human Genome Sciences is one of the principal tools used today for the discovery and characterization of novel human genes and as well as the genes of other species.|$|E

60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it <b>is</b> granted <b>that</b> its premisses <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then it follows <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true.' When it <b>is</b> the case <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies <b>that,</b> and this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true', or 'whatever follows from a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true'.|$|R

2500|$|The Nova {{documentary}} The Case of the Ancient Astronauts {{shows that}} all of the claims made by von D채niken about the Pyramid of Cheops were wrong. The technique of construction is well understood, the tools the Egyptians used are known, marks left in the quarries by those tools are still visible, and many examples of the tools are preserved in museums. Von D채niken claims that it would have taken the Egyptians too long to cut all the blocks necessary and drag them to the construction site in time to build the Great Pyramid in only 20 years; but the documentary demonstrates how quickly a block of stone can be cut with the available tools, and presents examples of the rollers used in their transportation. Von D채niken also claims that Egyptians built perfect pyramids from the beginning, but numerous pyramid precursors survive, showing the errors made, and corrected, by Egyptian architects while they were perfecting the technique. [...] These include simple mastabas, the Step Pyramid of Djoser, and the so-called Bent Pyramid. [...] Von D채niken claims that the height of the Cheops pyramid multiplied by one million is the distance to the Sun; if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> the pyramid would be 150km (93 miles) high. [...] He also claims that the Egyptians could not align the edges so perfectly to true North without advanced technology that only aliens could give them; but Egyptian builders knew of simple methods to find North via star observation, and it is trivial to make straight edges.|$|E
2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Nikki Bella and Natalya had a {{backstage}} confrontation {{that lead}} to Natalya shoving Nikki into Maryse. Later that night, The Miz attempted to eliminate John Cena from the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match only for Miz to get eliminated by Cena. On the February 21 episode of SmackDown, Nikki and Natalya's Falls Count Anywhere match led to the backstage area, where Natalya again shoved Nikki into Maryse, who retaliated by attacking Nikki with a lead pipe, thus costing her the match. In that episode's main event, the same incident between Cena and Miz happened in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, but this time, Miz returned and caused Cena's elimination. Cena was then the guest on Miz TV where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically {{doing the same thing}} that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that he works as hard as Cena, but does not get the same opportunities, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33 and wanted Cena to know what he felt when Cena defeated him for the WWE Championship back in 2011. Miz also said that Cena gets what he wants, but Cena said if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> he would be facing The Undertaker. Cena then criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Nikki then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. The following week, The Miz and Maryse attacked Cena and Nikki after the latter two's match against James Ellsworth and Carmella. The Miz said he was tired of Cena's lies and said his relationship with Nikki was also a lie. Afterwards on Talking Smack, The Miz and Maryse said that Nikki was in her current position because of her relationship with Cena and that Nikki was jealous of them because Cena would not marry Nikki. The following week, Miz and Maryse continued their insults against Cena and Nikki and the two came out and chased Miz and Maryse out of the ring. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then came out and said that since he could not fight The Miz, who had been insulting him for several months, both The Miz and Maryse would face Cena and Nikki at WrestleMania; Maryse's last match was in 2011. The Miz and Maryse then made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show Total Bellas by impersonating them in [...] "unaired footage". On March 27, Cena was a guest host on NBC's Today and revealed weatherman Al Roker as the guest ring announcer for the match. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, more [...] "unaired footage" [...] from Total Bellas was shown. The Miz and Maryse then threw more insults at Cena and Nikki, including Cena not wanting to have kids. Cena retaliated and asked how many kids Miz and Maryse had. Cena said that although he takes time off to make movies, he comes back to WWE when he is done, just as The Miz and other WWE Superstars have done before. Cena called Maryse a waste of a paycheck as she does not do much on the show and that she was only back in the WWE because Miz begged for it. Cena then said that he and Nikki would destroy Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania.|$|E

40|$|A {{paradox is}} called a {{statement}} which <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and false in the same time. Therefore, if we suppose <b>that</b> statement <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> it results <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false; and reciprocally, if we suppose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false, it results <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> 2. But there <b>are</b> statements <b>that</b> do not completely obey this definition. We call a Semi-Paradox a statement such that either supposing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> it results <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false (but not reciprocally), or supposing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false it results <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> (but not reciprocally).

He finds it sustained (or opposed) by the Bible, or he fancies it mixed with deviltry or the black art. He trembles for fear it will affect the scheme of redemption or assist some theosophical system. Whereas, a man like Bottazzi is engaged merely with the facts; he lets the inferences fall where they may. He is not concerned with whether Eusapia's manifestations oppose Christian theology or not; he wants the phenomena. He is alert to note their effect on biologic science, but he does not shrink from any report of them.
