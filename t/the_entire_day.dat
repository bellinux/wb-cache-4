50|$|Alluding to the trope, the CBBC {{television}} series Hounded features a literal reset button that, {{at the end}} of each episode, rewinds <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> events back to the beginning.|$|R
50|$|Motors TV used to {{show all}} the races live, {{including}} some support races, {{both in the}} UK and across Europe. In 2007 Setanta Sports showed all the races live, including the support races; this ceased when <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> coverage moved to ITV4.|$|R
50|$|Yaza is a Zen Buddhist {{term for}} a sitting time during sesshin that is {{above and beyond the}} normal daily routine. It is {{generally}} encouraged because it is more difficult to sit at this time when your body is exhausted from <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> routine.|$|R
5|$|This task {{system of}} slavery was common among sea island {{plantations}} in the Southeastern United States. In contrast, cotton and tobacco plantations in Virginia {{and other parts}} of the South practiced the gang system, where an overseer who was also a slave drove slaves to work <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{travel to}} New York City for the {{deposition}} of Jan's {{lawsuit against the}} company. While Michael originally intends to be a witness against the company, he ends up defending the company. Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) talks smack to Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) beats Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{in a game of}} ping pong, prompting Jim to spend <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> practicing in the conference room.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{material}} from the same day's performance was released in a second album Waltz for Debby (also 1961), as was other material in another LP Bill Evans — More From <b>the</b> Vanguard. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> recordings were released in 2005 as The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961.|$|R
5000|$|On a rainy day, {{the race}} went off at 6:52 PM, EST. [...] In {{spite of the}} weather, {{attendance}} was a record-breaking 135,256, beating the previous year's record of 131,680. The pari-mutuel take of $94,127,434 for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> races also broke the previous record of $91,028,000 in 2005.|$|R

5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{attempted}} to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day.</b> Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished {{control of the}} routes to the canal, opening {{them up to the}} Israelis. The battle is remembered {{as one of the most}} costly and brutal battles of the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> of a Jain monk {{is spent}} in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
50|$|Rain {{washed out}} {{practice}} for the day. It marked <b>the</b> third <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> lost to rain, and the eighth overall hampered by the weather.|$|R
60|$|The {{spectacle}} of Miss Durgan {{all across the}} road, with <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> correspondence of Hickleybrow in her hand, gave pause to the pullet in possession of Master Skelmersdale. She halted through one instant's indecision and then turned for the open gates of Fulcher's yard. That instant was fatal. The second pullet ran in neatly, got possession of the child by a well-directed peck, and went over the wall into the vicarage garden.|$|R
50|$|Although Arkansas did {{not destroy}} any enemy vessels, she inflicted losses among the {{personnel}} of the Federal fleets. In the engagement on the Yazoo and her {{passage of the}} fleet at Vicksburg, their total loss was 18 killed, 50 wounded, and an additional 10 missing (probably drowned). Farragut's fleet lost another 5 killed and 9 wounded when they ran past the Vicksburg batteries. The cost to Arkansas for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> action was 12 killed and 18 wounded.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, play resumed in poor visibility, with {{frequent}} interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers {{to bear a}} greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead {{at the close of}} play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for {{a large part of the}} final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF {{would be out of}} position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day),</b> for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German technical failure in air-to-air communication.|$|E

The network also broadcasts a featured movie in primetime at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday through Friday nights.|$|R
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day.</b> Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was not keeping pace with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft to go around.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto Frah {{performed}} traditional vakindrazana and vazikoava {{pieces for}} sodina, commonly heard {{at a variety}} of holidays and rites observed in the central highlands of Madagascar. The music accompanying the famadihana reburial ceremonies of the central highlands, for instance, is typically performed by an ensemble of sodina players accompanied by the amponga drum. These sodina performances, which express the joy of reuniting with the ancestors, are often competitive. More than one troupe may be present at the famadihana and will take turns showing off their musical skills, with the rapid flight of notes intended to inspire dancing over the course of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> or week of the celebration. The rural artistic tradition of the hira gasy is equally joyful but more elaborate, showcasing the music, dance and oratory skills of a large troupe that includes male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and a variety of orchestral instruments such as clarinets, trumpets and violins.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
50|$|As was expected, the {{top three}} men in the GC, having been in a {{breakaway}} almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> previous <b>day,</b> fell in the overall standings after the time trial, and the Tour had its third different rider in yellow at the day's end.|$|R

5|$|The {{team did}} not have any rider {{highlighted}} as a favorite entering the Giro di Lombardia; pre-race analyses held Gilbert as the man to beat. Zaugg rode {{at the front of the}} race <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> riding off the front to occupy first position as the solo leader on the Villa Vergano climb. He then maintained his advantage on the alternating flat sections and remaining climbs (the Muro dell'Alpino and the finishing climb in Lecco), holding on for victory ahead of 's Dan Martin and 's Joaquim Rodríguez by 8 seconds. The victory was not only Zaugg's first monument classic win, or even his first single-day win, it was his first professional victory of any kind, coming at age 30. Post-race analysis compared Zaugg's triumph to some of the more notable upsets to which the race has played host in its history.|$|E
5|$|Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav bombarded Ottoman fortifications at {{the mouth}} of the Bosphorus on 18 March 1915, but only fired 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin the {{covering}} force. Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav were to have repeated the bombardment the following day, but heavy fog prevented the operation. On 3 April, Goeben and several ships of the Turkish navy raided the Russian port at Odessa; the Russian battleship squadron sortied to intercept them. The battleships chased Goeben <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> but were unable to reach effective gunnery range and were forced to break off the chase. On 25 April Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav repeated their bombardment of the Bosporus forts. Sviatitelia, Rostislav and Panteleimon bombarded the forts again on 2 and 3 May. However, this time a total of 337 main gun rounds were fired in addition to a total of 528 six-inch shells between the three battleships.|$|E
5|$|Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav bombarded Ottoman fortifications at {{the mouth}} of the Bosphorus on 18 March 1915, the first of several attacks {{intended}} to divert troops and attention from the ongoing Gallipoli Campaign, but fired only 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin Panteleimon, Ioann Zlatoust and Evstafi. Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav were intended to repeat the bombardment the following day, but were hindered by heavy fog.
