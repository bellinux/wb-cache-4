The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengh</b> of the joints {{was investigated in}} connection with the brazed microstructures. The brazed microstructures are categorized into two types according to the sizes of β-Ti and intermetallic compounds, The brazed microsteucture categorized as Type I exhibits that the fine βーTi and the intermetallic compounds surrounded by amorphous phase are dispersed within the filler metal region， whi 1 e the brazed microstructure categorized as Type II exhibits that the large β-Ti and the intermetallic compounds are localized within the fi 1 ler metal region. The joints with Type I brazed microstructure have the tensile strength of about 600 MPa，the value of which is one and a half times as 1 arge as that of the joints with Type II brazed microstrcture. The increase in tensiles strength of the joints with Type I brazed microstructure is attributed to homogeneous plastic deformation resulting from the characteristic of their brazed microstructure...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of high-performance thermoplastic poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) with inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS(2)) nanoparticles offers an attractive way {{to combine the}} merits of organic and inorganic materials into novel polymer nanocomposite materials. Here, we report the processing of novel PEEK/IF-WS(2) nanocomposites, which overcome the nanoparticle agglomerate formation and provide PEEK-particle interactions. The IF-WS(2) nanoparticles do not require exfoliation or modification, {{making it possible to}} obtain stronger, lighter materials without the complexity and processing cost associated with these treatments. The nanocomposites were fabricated by melt blending, after a predispersion step based on ball milling and mechanical treatments in organic solvent, which leads to the dispersion of individually IF-WS(2) nanoparticles in the PEEK matrix as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. In order to determine the performance of the PEEK/IF-WS(2) nanocomposites for potential critical applications, particularly for the aircraft industry, we have extensively investigated these materials {{with a wide range of}} structural, thermal, and mechanical techniques using time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic-mechanical analysis, and tensile and impact tests as well as thermal measurements. Modulus, <b>tensile</b> <b>strengh,</b> thermal stability, and thermal conductivity of PEEK exhibited remarkable improvement with the addition of IF-WS(2) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Since {{bone marrow}} {{has been shown}} to contain osteoprogenitor cells, an {{experiment}} was devised to test its effects when injected percutaneously into osteotomies sites in rabbit radii. In this experimental study, the osteogenicity and it's effect on early bone repair of bone marrow grafts were investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether bone marrow grafted percutaneously led to increased bone production or had any effect on the early healing of fractures. The parameters tested included, cross-sectional area of callus (XS), breaking load (BL), <b>tensile</b> <b>strengh</b> (TS) and callus volume (CV) at the fracture site. At two weeks postgrafting four parameters, specially callus volume, were significantly higher (0. 001 < P < 0. 005) in grafted radii than in the contralateral saline controls. By four weeks all four parameters were significantly greater in the bone marrow grafted radii than in the contralateral saline controls. Serial radiographs and histology confirm this advanced fracture healing in the grafted bones. There were no differences between the external callus of BM (Bone marrow) and SC (Saline control) radii but the internal callus between the end of the cortical bone did show a difference between the two sides. The earlier and more abundant callus at the bone marrow grafted sites, was felt to provide earlier and greater stability, resulting in decreased early healing time when contrasted with the saline controls. Percutaneous bone marrow grafting is a simple semi-invasive technique that may have potential clinical application...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of factors affecting cement sheath strength {{has been carried}} out [...] This study performed on hardened (cured for seven days) cement specimens. These specimens were prepared by mixing 35 % fresh water by weight of dry Portland cement (class A according to API classification or C 150 type I according to ASTM classification) plus various percentages of Thumama sand (5 - 40 % by weight of dry cement). The relationship between cement tensile and compressive strengths as well as cement direct and indirect <b>tensile</b> <b>strenghs</b> have been established. Factors affecting cement-casing and cement-formation shear bond strength were studied. Cement compressive and tensile strength were correlated to each other {{as well as to the}} cement shear bond strength. It was found that casing surface roughness, casing surface cleaning and casing centralization have enhanced the strength of cement-casing shear bond, whereas the deposition of mud cake on the wall of the simulated borehole has reduced the strength of cement-formation shear bond...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (Mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciencias Agrarias, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência dos Alimentos, Florianópolis, 2012 O a-tocoferol, isômero da Vitamina E, é um antioxidante natural, amplamente empregado como aditivo em alimentos. No entanto, a utilização de seus efeitos benéficos é limitada devido à sua instabilidade frente às degradações químicas do ambiente, causadas pela oxidação e temperatura. A nanoencapsulação pode ser uma alternativa para proteger o a-tocoferol de um ambiente desfavorável, além de promover uma liberação controlada deste composto. As nanocápsulas também podem ser aplicadas em biofilmes para atuarem como embalagens ativas na preservação dos alimentos. Em vista disso, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo o desenvolvimento de nanocápsulas de a-tocoferol para aplicação em biofilmes de metilcelulose. Suspensões de nanocápsulas foram preparadas pela técnica da nanoprecipitação. A metodologia de superfície de resposta foi empregada para avaliar a influencia da quantidade do a-tocoferol e das concentrações dos surfactantes lecitina e Pluronic F 68 sobre a eficiência de encapsulação, tamanho de partícula e índice de polidispersão, a fim de se obter condições ótimas para o preparo de nanocápsulas. Foram também avaliadas a estabilidade das suspensões através do potencial zeta, a recuperação total do a-tocoferol e a morfologia das nanocápsulas. As condições ótimas para a encapsulação do a-tocoferol foram obtidas a 200 mg de a-tocoferol, 2, 5 mg/mL de lecitina e 1 % (m/v) de Pluronic F 68, com valores experimentais de 99, 97 % para eficiência de encapsulação, 184, 6 nm para o tamanho de partícula e 0, 112 para o índice de polidispersão. Todas as formulações apresentaram uma {{excelente}} estabilidade (potencial zeta Abstract : The a-tocopherol Vitamin E isomer is {{a natural}} antioxidant widely used as a food additive. However, the use of its beneficial effects is limited because of its chemical instability {{in the face of}} environmental degradation caused by oxidation and temperature. The nanoencapsulation can be an alternative to protect the a-tocopherol in an unfavorable environment, and promote a controlled release of this compound. The nanocapsules can also be added in biofilms to act as active packaging for food preservation. In view of this, the present study aimed at the development of nanocapsules of a-tocopherol for application in methylcellulose biofilms. Nanocapsule suspensions were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method. The response surface methodology was used to evaluate the influence of the amount of a-tocopherol and the surfactants concentrations, lecithin and Pluronic F 68, on the encapsulation efficiency, particle size and polydispersity index, in order to obtain optimal conditions for preparing nanocapsules. The stability of suspensions, by the zeta potential, the total recovery of a-tocopherol and morphology of the nanocapsules were also evaluated. The optimum conditions for a-tocopherol encapsulation were obtained at 200 mg of a-tocopherol, 2. 5 mg/mL of lecithin and 1 % (w/v) of Pluronic F 68, with experimental values of 99. 97 % for encapsulation efficiency, 184. 6 nm for the particle size and 0112 for polydispersity index. All formulations showed excellent stability (zeta potential <- 30 mV) and high values of a-tocopherol recovery. Spherical particles, with a capsular structure were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The methylcellulose biofilms were developed by "casting" by adding three different proportions of nanocapsules. The mechanical properties, wettability, color, light transmission, morphology, antioxidant activity and release of a-tocopherol to the fatty food stimulant were evaluated. The addition of nanocapsules in methylcellulose films significantly reduced the <b>tensile</b> <b>strengh</b> and elastic modulus, but increased elongation and thickness, leading to films less rigid and more elastic. Films with nanocapsules showed greater hydrophobicity compared with the control film. The yellowish color and lightness were enhanced with the incorporation of nanocapsules. A high antioxidant activity and excellent barrier properties against UV light and visible were observed. Furthermore, there was a burst and sustained release of a-tocopherol to the food simulant...|$|E
