40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a rotor design technique for a <b>turbo</b> <b>blower</b> supported by magnetic bearings that considers the critical speeds of the rotor. An important factor for rotor critical speeds is the stiffness of its bearings. The magnetic bearing {{acts as a}} negative spring, called the position stiffness prior to operation, and rotor systems are initially unstable until the stiffness (current stiffness) and damping in the active control rotating system are determined using closed loop control forces. This paper describes a finite element model for the rotor, derives the stiffness equations for the magnetic bearing, and defines the total magnetic bearing stiffness including the position stiffness and current stiffness. Finally, the magnetic bearing stiffness that avoids the rotor critical speeds is chosen...|$|E

50|$|BHP {{commenced}} {{power supply}} to Whyalla in 1908 and Iron Knob in 1922. A second powerhouse {{was built in}} the 1920s to replace the first and was decommissioned in late 1941 (though it was still standing in the 1990s). The third powerhouse was built in 1941 as part of the No.1 Blast furnace. It features two turbo alternators and two <b>turbo</b> <b>blowers</b> and remains in operation. It provides electricity for use around the plant and air to the blast furnace. Compressed air is also utilised around the plant by a number of other departments.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{emitted by}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} suction unit {{consists}} of airborne and structure-borne noise. The airborne noise is generated mainly by the <b>turbo</b> <b>blower</b> and the structure-borne noise is generated mainly by the driving electric motor. The structure-borne noise depends on the suction unit design and on operating conditions, and is especially distinct at partial flow rates when rotating stall and surge appear. Among geometrical parameters, the statorof the blower and the electric motor, or metal shield if any, have the greatest effect on the structure-borne noise. Therefore, {{in this part of}} the paper, the effects of vibrations of the electric motor structure on the noise characteristics have been measured and analysed at the design and off-design operation. The contribution of structure-borne sound to the total sound pressure level becomes relatively less important at higher flow rates and with a vaned diffuser built-in the blower...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of {{designing}} high-speed surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM), the rotor retaining sleeve is inserted into the rotor to prevent the permanent magnet&# 39;s damage. It is quite {{an efficient way to}} consider manufacturability, but the sleeve becomes the major source of ohm loss in high-speed operation. In this paper, the high-speed motor for a <b>turbo</b> <b>blower</b> at the rating of 100 kW, 20 000 r/min was introduced. To improve its efficiency, the retaining sleeve&# 39;s optimal design was needed. For this, parametric analysis on the shape of the retaining sleeve was carried out in a different type of motor. Within a range that meets the mechanical safety, sleeve designs have been changed. The effect of changing design variables of the sleeve was studied. This paper presents the optimized sleeve&# 39;s advantages in electrical efficiency from the results of the electromagnetic finite element analysis software. Finally, it suggests the optimal sleeve design to reduce eddy-current loss, which is related to motor shape.

40|$|Nowadays tissue {{makers are}} facing many energy related {{challenges}} – the increasing energy price, the regulations from government about limitation of energy consumption and various demands from customers in different {{locations of the}} world concerning how to increase the energy efficiency and improve their working environment. As {{one of the leading}} tissue machine manufacturers, Metso Paper is making great efforts to reduce the energy consumption and increase the energy efficiency of tissue machines. New technologies are developed to reduce the energy consumption and the heat exchanger network is studied to find more valuable heat. To know how to combine the new technologies developed in Metso Paper, a model is developed so that the energy and economic evaluation could be carried out for three different configurations (STD, BAT and BDG) in different locations. Heat recovery is carried out for the drying section of a standard DCT 200 tissue machine in Luleå (Sweden) and Lagos (Nigeria) where district heating and district cooling are in demand respectively. Pinch technology which is a systematic tool for heat analysis is used for process integration. Finally different heat exchanger networks are suggested in these two locations. It is found from the simulation results of the model that the new-developed technologies could bring significant energy savings. The interactions between different components of tissue machines are studied so {{it is now clear that}} the electricity production from the turbine will be influenced by the choice of the headbox etc. From the economic evaluation, it is found that the BAT configuration is more profitable for Sweden while BDG is more suitable for Russia. By studying heat recovery in the drying section, it is discovered that the hot moist air from the <b>turbo</b> <b>blower</b> should be considered as a hot stream if it is available. Adsorption chillers should be used in Lagos to transfer the excess heat into the cooling water. With the low gas price in Lagos, the steam generator could be removed so that more excess heat could be used to make the cooling wate...|$|E

40|$|Global {{concerns}} about declining resources {{and climate change}} mean that industries must {{do their best to}} use energy as efficiently as possible. Energy is also an important component of a modern economy. The pulp and paper industry {{is one of the most}} energy-intensive industries round the world. In this study energy efficiency opportunities in pulp drying machines are identified and the saving potential is then quantified. The methodology followed was based on comparison of energy saving technologies and practices such as <b>Turbo</b> Vacuum <b>blowers,</b> Shoe Press, Heat pump, Use of low pressure steam etc. The data used for the calculations was taken from the mill data records. Six energy efficiency improvement projects were identified. The total proposed energy saving potential in the two Drying Machines studied in the thesis is 10511 MWh. Installation of the shoe press shows the highest saving potential followed by the <b>turbo</b> vacuum <b>blowers.</b> Although the accuracy of the results is heavily dependent upon the accuracy of the data records from the case study mill. The proposed savings would act as a reference point and depending upon the estimated savings potential, would help the mill to identify areas, projects that need more detailed measurements for further action...|$|R
50|$|Used to {{cool the}} {{heatsink}} of the graphics processing unit or the memory on graphics cards. These fans were not necessary on older cards because of their low power dissipation, but most modern graphics cards designed for 3D graphics and gaming need their own dedicated cooling fans. Some of the higher powered cards can produce more heat than the CPU (dissipating up to 289 watts), so effective cooling is especially important. Since 2010, graphics cards have been released with either axial fans, or a centrifugal fan commonly known as a <b>blower,</b> <b>turbo</b> or squirrel cage fan.|$|R
5000|$|All 149s have {{overhead}} camshafts and {{the cylinder}} heads {{fit into the}} engine block; this {{is referred to as}} the [...] "pothead" [...] design. The blowers are also recessed into the block; this section of the block is called the [...] "airbox". Above the blower is a thick piece of steel that covers the blower and seals the top section of the air box. On a turbocharged engine an intercooler and sometimes a by-pass housing is present with the intercooler housing. The 12V,16V configurations have two blocks, two crankshafts bolted together, two <b>blowers,</b> and four <b>turbos.</b> The 16V149 has dual 10 in exhaust outlets with eight bolt flanges. The 20V configuration was mainly designed for haul trucks. Detroit could push the envelope of the 16V.(In the marine version it could produce 2400 HP @ 2100 RPM.) But it would require additional special parts. They wanted 2500 HP with off the shelf parts, so the 20V149 was born. It has 3 engine blocks, 3 crankshafts bolted together. The unique set up of the 20V has a 6V block on either end of a special 8V block with 6 <b>turbos,</b> 3 <b>blowers</b> and intercoolers.|$|R
