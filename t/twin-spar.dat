25|$|The Pfalz’s primary {{advantage}} was {{its strength}} and sturdiness. The Albatros scouts were plagued by failure of their single-spar lower wings. The Pfalz, however, could safely dive {{at high speeds}} due to its <b>twin-spar</b> lower wing. For this reason, the Pfalz was well-suited to diving attacks on observation balloons, which were usually heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns trained to the balloon's altitude.|$|E
25|$|Ergonomic and {{cosmetic}} {{changes for the}} 2008 model include a higher windscreen, and interlocking gauge faces with a digital speedometer, {{as well as a}} new gear indicator and adjustable shift light. The fairing fasteners were hidden to uncomplicate custom paint work. The <b>twin-spar</b> aluminum frame was carried over from the previous version, and wheelbase, rake/trail, and seat height were the same, while overall length grew by two inches, and the taller windscreen added about ½inch. Weight was saved by omitting the centerstand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{all-metal}} {{tail unit}} had a dorsal fin {{integrated with the}} fuselage, and a [...] <b>twin-spar</b> tailplane with inset divided elevators. The control surfaces were mass-balanced, and each had controllable trim and servo tabs.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, <b>twin-spar</b> structure. The {{untapered}} centre section carried the inboard engines and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their leading and trailing edges, with the inner sections carrying the outboard engines. The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and inner wings. A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both inner wings.|$|E
5000|$|The frame {{used on the}} ZX-7R is a {{lightweight}} aluminum <b>twin-spar</b> item, designed using computer-aided design to optimize strength. The rear subframe was constructed using steel, providing enough strength for a pillion passenger.|$|E

50|$|The KLX however {{is still}} a fast machine and a {{dedicated}} off roader that shares essentially the same motor and aluminum <b>twin-spar</b> frame of its motocross sibling. It is also renowned for its supple suspension feel and strong brakes.|$|E
50|$|New model {{based on}} a {{complete}} redesign of the VF750F, full fairing, alloy <b>twin-spar</b> frame, gear-driven camshafts, single-color paintwork, and 16 inch front and 18 inch rear wheels.The VFR750FG also had a cam sensor which was omitted from all later versions.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} a 999cc dual {{overhead}} cam V-twin unit with two fuel injectors and four valves per cylinder. Power is {{delivered to the}} rear wheel by a close-ratio, six-speed transmission. The chassis is constructed from aluminium alloy, being a <b>twin-spar</b> design.|$|E
50|$|The X3 is {{the brainchild}} of Ilmor co-founder Mario Illien and former grand prix rider Eskil Suter of Suter Racing Technology (SRT). Illien used his world {{championship}} winning F1 engine experience to design the machines V4 powerplant, with Suter, who has previously designed Kawasakis MotoGP chassis, in charge of the <b>twin-spar</b> aluminum frame.|$|E
50|$|Non-adjustable 41 mm {{inverted}} forks {{are combined}} with a <b>twin-spar</b> steel frame to provide improved handling. Stock suspension setting is firm, providing stability through corners. Although commonly found only in larger sized sport bikes, the Hyosung GT250R comes standard with a 300 mm front disc setup using twin-piston calipers. Rear brakes is a single 230 mm disc.|$|E

5000|$|The 1996 GSX-R {{introduced}} a new <b>twin-spar</b> frame which was derived from Suzuki's RGV 500 GP racer. A new compact and lightweight engine incorporated magnesium covers on the cylinder head, starter motor and clutch cover to aid weight reduction. These changes resulted in a decrease in weight by 20 kg to 179 kg, while power had increased to a [...] This year's model finally addressed the weight problems that had plagued the GSX-R through {{the first half of}} the 90s.|$|E
50|$|Chassis: Starting in 1997, Honda {{started the}} first gen {{aluminum}} frames. The first gen frames were thick, rigid and {{were a big}} change from the previous steel frames. Then in 2000, Honda {{came out with the}} second gen aluminum frame, which was less rigid. It also had a smaller and thinner <b>twin-spar</b> aluminum frame, which provided the rigidity decrease. That made for better handling. Then in 2002, they came out with the third gen aluminum frame, which was thinner, and lighter. They kept the same frame with minor suspension changes until they stopped production of any 2-stroke in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|More {{improvements}} {{gave the}} 1989 NSR500 upwards of [...] at 12,000 rpm — essentially doubling {{the output of}} the 1966 Honda RC181 Grand Prix four-stroke. Capable of well over 190 mi/h km/h, the 1989 bikes had more top speed and acceleration than anything else on the track. To contain all that muscle, the stiffer, <b>twin-spar</b> aluminum chassis used a curved, gull-wing-type swingarm to accommodate more efficient expansion chambers. The result was an unforgiving, but brutally fast, package that earned Honda a fourth 500 cc World Championship in 1989 thanks to Eddie Lawson who had joined the factory back Rothmans team alongside Gardner and young Australian Mick Doohan.|$|E

5000|$|The Kawasaki ZZ-R1200 {{motorcycle}} {{was built}} by Kawasaki. Identified by its model number ZX1200-C1, it is the successor to the ZX-11. [...] Considered a sport tourer, it features a <b>twin-spar</b> aluminum frame with four-stroke, DOHC, four-cylinder liquid-cooled engine. It has double fans, double fuel pumps, and double headlights. Additionally, hard touring bags can be added as an option. With factory rear wheel horsepower of 145HP; it is widely regarded {{to be the most}} powerful production motorcycle ever built with carbureted induction.It was even more powerful than the fuel injected Honda CBR1100XX. It has been said it was more powerful than any other production motorcycle carbureted or not @9800rpm where it made peak power except the Suzuki Hayabusa or ZX-12R.With a quarter-mile time of 10.12 seconds at 136.9 mph.|$|E
5000|$|The 1000S [...] "New Edge" [...] {{design was}} drawn by Peter Naumann who {{designed}} the F-117 Stealth Fighter, and the 1000S won a silver medal from International Design Forum. Initial reports were that this would have a V-twin engine, but MZ eventually opted for a parallel-twin instead with a 180° crank. The frame is a <b>twin-spar</b> design, not unlike that of the Aprilia Falco; but whereas the Falco has an alloy frame, the MZ used chrome-moly steel.The prototype model of the 1000S was previewed during Intermot 2000 in Germany and went into production in 2003. The bike initially sold well, particularly in Germany. MZ, who had grand plans to become a major world manufacturer, went on to produce some variants of the 1000S such as the MZ 1000SF naked bike and MZ 1000ST sports touring bike. Financial troubles set in and the MZ factory was closed.|$|E
50|$|Entirely {{redesigned}} for 1988, the NSR500 got a stiffer, <b>twin-spar</b> aluminium chassis {{and various}} engine changes. The changes {{made to the}} 1988 bike made it somewhat problematic for the riders, especially {{in the first half}} of the season. Wayne Gardner had a hard time in defence of his 1987 World Championship and although he eventually got on top of the bikes problems and won three races in a row in mid-season (Dutch TT, Belgium and Yugoslavia), he could only finish second in the championship behind the Yamaha of Eddie Lawson. The main complaints about the 1988 NSR500 was that the engine, while undoubtedly the most powerful in 500cc racing, was very 'peaky' and had to run up high in the rev range to get the best out of it. Also the suspension geometry of the bike wasn't as good as in 1987 and the bike was noticeably harder to handle through the turns than the rival Yamaha YZR500 and Suzuki's new RGV500. While the engines power advantage was seen on the faster tracks such as Suzuka (which is actually owned by Honda), Assen, Spa and Paul Ricard, on tighter tracks such as Jarama and Jerez it was off the pace due to its handling.|$|E
5000|$|Arctic Cat {{is known}} for their M series {{snowmobile}} models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski-doo and Polaris in 2003. This [...] "Skinny Mini" [...] prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time, by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width then other sleds, reducing rotating mass. Cat discovered that this design was splendid for mountain riding, however the trail model developed an over heating issue as the heat exchanges {{were found to be}} insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions. Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues, this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where cat bought back from owners 3200 short track Firecat F-7's. These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine. which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures. Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a <b>twin-spar</b> chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine, the Z1 Jaguar, which featured an 1056cc 4-stroke parallel twin. In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce , which was [...] more than any other production snowmobile. The Crossfire and M-series remain on the same M-series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis.|$|E
