40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to assess the {{possibility}} <b>of</b> predicting the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layers</b> produced by High Power Diode Laser (HPDL) heat treatment. Instrumented indentation by cylindrical flat punch {{was carried out in}} order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the surface-hardening heat treatments on milled AISI 1040 steel substrates by varying laser operational parameters as well as the morphology of steel substrates. In particular, the trend in load-penetration depth were obtained, supporting the identification of the depth at which the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> starts transferring the deformation to the softer substrate, that is, the Critical Transition Depth (CTD) in addition to identifying the overall degree <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> reached by the laser treated material. On the other hand, hardness profiles and the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layers</b> were also monitored by using combination of Vickers micro-hardness tests and standard metallographic characterizations. Analytical examinations and simple mathematical simulations of the experimental results coming from indentation tests and conventional testing procedures showed good correlation between the extent of the heat affected zone (HAZ), hardness and CTD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that indentation tests are an effective, sensitive, fast, and low-cost characterization technique for heat treated steels. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

The method consists in magnetizing the parts and measuring the residual tangential magnetic field strength. Calibration is necessary by parts with well known case depth.

40|$|Titanium alloys due {{to their}} {{properties}} are of great interest {{for use as a}} structural material for the parts of friction units, pump plungers, shaft-bush parts operating in harsh environments. But high tendency of titanium alloys to the contact seizure under friction restricts wider application of titanium and its alloys. One of the main ways to improve the anti-friction properties of titanium alloys is a chemical heat treatment. The most common type is nitrogen hardening that allows us to achieve high values of micro-hardness on the surface. However, the biggest drawback of the method is small depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> that is up to 0. 16 mm. To increase a depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> the paper proposes the preprocessing of the part surface by deformational cutting, which allows creating a macro-relief of different shape as the alternate vertical or inclined layers of the part material <b>of</b> a specified <b>thickness</b> and height with a gap or no gap between the layers. Doping of this structure, when nitriding, is provided over the entire macro-pattern surface, thereby enabling to obtain a <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer,</b> which depends on the processing parameters in deformational cutting. The paper presents the results of the microstructure study and the micro-hardness measurements of the VT 1 - 0 titanium alloy sample after deformational cutting process followed by nitriding. The influence of the deformational cutting parameters on the total <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> surface <b>layer</b> is analyzed.

The increase of surface layer wear resistance is obvious when the SMAT time is 15 minutes.

Ion nitriding was performed with a 100 Hz square wave glow discharge, {{in an atmosphere}} of an 80 % N 2 and 20 % H 2 mixture, under a total pressure of 5. 6 mbar. Pulsed plasma irradiation consisted in the surface irradiation with a predetermined number of pulses of high energy and short duration argon plasmas, accelerated in a Z-Pinch experiment. Each pulse can induce high temperatures in a short time (< 200 ns), followed by an also fast (10 μs) cooling down.

The proposed procedure consists in performing the Vickers microindentation hardness test across the carbonitrided steel {{in order to obtain}} the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layers.</b> Thus, with the assumption of a linear variation of the plastic properties in the intermediate layers between surface and substrate, two spherical macroindentation tests, performed on the substrate and {{on the surface of the}} carbonitrided steel, are necessary to identify the work hardening laws' variation through the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the carbonitrided steel. The proposed method does not call for inverse analysis but is based on the use of a database of finite element simulation F–h curves obtained by simulating indentation tests on the surface of various pseudo-carbonitrided materials. The advantage of this method compared to those based on inverse analysis is that it allows a representative strain and a confidence domain of the solution to be determined. The confidence domain of the identified solution takes into account the experimental imprecision of the indentation test and of the case depth variability often encountered in carbonitrided parts...|$|R

In order to obtain grey cast iron parts with a hard superficial layer (wear resistant), external metallic coolers are placed on those surfaces during casting. This {{is the case of}} cam pushers, camshafts, driving shafts, metalworking rolls, etc. Cast iron coolers or steel coolers are mostly used in practice. The cooling rate during solidification is influenced by the thermo-physical characteristics of the coolers.

40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} the hardness {{at the surface}} of ion-nitrided stainless steels, a plastic deformation by tensile test is performed previously to the nitriding treatment. This plastic deformation leads to an increase of the dislocation density which can be potentially used as diffusion paths for atoms. In this paper, influence of different plastic strain rates on the hardness variation close to the outer surface of the material is studied. However, the hardness-depth profile usually obtained from indentations performed on a cross-section of the sample is not consistent enough to represent the hardness variation {{very close to the}} outer surface, i. e. on distance lower than 20 µm. In order to obtain hardness values in the first twenty microns in depth, a simple model based on indentations performed at the modified surface is originally proposed. The predicted hardness-depth profile in different situations of work-hardening clearly demonstrates the efficiency of the prior plastic deformation on the global hardness improvement of the nitrided stainless steel. As a result, the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> varies between 20 µm to 35 µm when the plastic deformation rate increases from 0 to 80 % of the maximum elongation rate. This hardness increase is attributed to the extension of the nitrided layer due to the augmentation of the dislocation density by the work-hardening process...|$|R

Three batches of cylindrical disc specimens were prepared from an alloyed steel, 60 Sicr 7 and were austenitized at 820 C for 30 min. Three different batches of samples were quenched in a salt bath maintained at 250, 300 & 350 C respectively for 1 h. Then the dry rolling/sliding wear tests were performed with each batch of samples for three different test cycles namely 6000, 18000 and 30000 cycles respectively to study the wear performance of these specific steels in the context of rail applications along with the in-depth microstructural characterization. The wear resistance was related to the total mass loss measured after the tests and the worn surfaces were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Micro-hardness profiles were also obtained to analyze strain- hardening effects beneath the contact surfaces.

Improving the tribological properties of titanium alloys {{has been the}} subject of extensive research for many years. A number of thermochemical processes have been developed for that purpose. In this study, surface <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> Ti 6 Al 4 V is achieved by Triode Plasma Oxidation (TPO) which differs from conventional diode plasma treatments through the use of a third electrode; a negatively biased tungsten filament to enhance the ionisation levels in the plasma. The resultant surface generally consists of a top oxide layer with an oxy- gen diffusion zone lying immediately underneath it. The effects of process parameters such as substrate tem- perature, current density and oxygen partial pressure have been investigated. Surface hardness measurements at various indentation loads were carried out to assess the changes in hardness with depth across the diffusion layer. The hardness profiles obtained confirmed the gradual decrease in hardness with treatment depth and provided an indication <b>of</b> the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> produced. Ball-on-plate reciprocating sliding wear data and glancing angle XRD analyses of the oxidised samples are also presented.

Three different batches of samples were austempered in a salt bath maintained at 250, 300 and 350 °C respectively for 1 h. Rolling with 5 % sliding wear tests were performed with each batch of samples for different test cycles, namely 6000, 18000 and 30000 cycles respectively, {{in order to}} study the wear performance of these specific steels. An in-depth microstructural characterization {{has been carried out}} before and after the wear tests in order to link the wear behaviour to the microstructure of each sample. The wear resistance has been expressed by means of the specific wear calculated from the mass loss after the tests. The worn surfaces were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Micro-hardness profiles were also obtained to analyze strainhardening effects beneath the contact surfaces. The results indicate that the harder material exhibited overall lower wear rates for all test cycles studied i. e., the one austempered at 250 °C showed superior rolling/sliding wear resistance than the rest. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} hardness increment and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> increases with increasing the austempering temperature and number of test cycles. Furthermore the results appear to indicate that the initial roughness of the samples has no major effect on the outcome of the results. The higher wear performance of the sample austempered at 250 °C has been attributed to its superior mechanical properties provided by its finer microstructure. It has been evidenced that all samples suffer the TRIP phenomenon since, after wear, no retained austenite could be detected by XRD.

40|$|Demands {{for better}} {{products}} and more environmentally friendly manufacturing advance the technological developments in quality control applications. Especially car manufacturers which mostly use steel components strive to produce higher quality components with cost efficient ways. In {{order to improve}} the quality of steel components, raw material needs to be processed with special methods. One of the common methods to increase the quality characteristics of steel components is surface hardening process which also increases the service life and fatigue properties of components. There are different methods available to <b>harden</b> the surfaces <b>of</b> steel components to increase their strength. In principle, surface hardening provides a case <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> on top <b>of</b> the soft core which also prevents the crack initiation and propagation. The quality control of the produced case can be made by measuring the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> which is called case depth measurement. Case depth needs to be measured because it verifies the quality <b>of</b> the <b>hardening</b> process as well as the thickness left for re-grinding operations. There are various methods available for case depth measurements. However, industries seek a reliable nondestructive method which could possibly be applied to entire volume of manufacturing, be fast, environmentally friendly and possibly cheap. Currently, hardness profiling is the most common technique for quality control <b>of</b> the surface <b>hardening</b> process. However, this method is destructive, expensive and slow. In order to develop a nondestructive technique to overcome this problem, many methods have been tried so far. Barkhausen noise (BN) has been one of the promising methods to success this. In this thesis, BN is investigated by using newly developed sensors, software and other hardware to measure the case depth <b>of</b> various <b>hardened</b> steel components. In the thesis, it was indicated that recently developed method of using BN for nondestructive case depth measurement is promising although it still requires further testing period.

BN measurements are sensitive and any change in the system and samples, dramatically change the results and affect the correlations.

Theses stresses are closely correlated with the corresponding process parameters, including the work material properties. As it is well known, not only the mechanical but also the physical properties of the work materials have great influence on machining residual stress. This was demonstrated in the present work through studying the residual stress and work hardening induced by the turning of AISI 316 L and AISI 1045 steels. The {{residual stresses}} were determined at the workpiece surface and in-depth using the X-ray diffraction technique. To understand the influence of the work material properties on the residual stress and work hardening distributions, the mechanical and thermal phenomena occurring during the cutting process were studied, using a t developed experimental procedure. The experimental setup included a piezoelectric dynamometer to determine the cutting forces, and thermal imaging equipment developed to assess the temperature distribution in the deformation zone in turning. The results showed that the cutting forces and temperatures in the machining of 316 L steel are much higher than those in the machining of 1045 steel.

40|$|Abstract. Flame {{hardening}} {{has been}} traditionally used for selective surface <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> steel. This technique frequently resulting in imprecise harden area and part distortion when overheated. Focused heating source such as plasma arc {{can be an}} alternative to overcome this problem. In this work, plasma arc is scanned at the 4340 steel surface to improve the hardness. The variable parameters investigated were at scanning speed and operating current. Four types of surfaces were observed after they are scanned with plasma arc. They are fully-melted, partially-melted, non-melted continuous and non-melted intermittent where each type of surface has different roughness value. This work found that scanning speed and operating current has significantly influence the type of surface and roughness values. Analysis on non-melted surface gives the maximum depth <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> about 187 µm as well as hardness values of about 990 HV 50. It is also observed that the depth <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> and hardness value is significantly decreasing with increase in scanning speed or the decrease in operating current. Microstructure examination on <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> revealed that the increase of hardness is due to formation of fine grain martensitie structure...|$|R
40|$|Modification {{of steel}} surface by {{hardening}} process is traditionally done either by oxy-fuel, induction, laser or electron beam hardening. The technique using plasma arc which needed low initial cost {{is a new}} alternative for surface hardening. In this work, single and multiple pass of plasma arc was used to improve the hardness of ASSAB 705 steel surface. The variable parameters investigated were scanning velocity, operating current, gas pressure and stand off distance. After single pass scanning treatment, four types of surfaces were observed. They were fully-melted, partially-melted, non-melted and inconstant-affected where each type of surface indicated different type of roughness. This work has showed that scanning speed and operating current was significantly influence the type of surface and roughness values. Analysis on nonmelted surface after treatment gives maximum depth <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> about 186. 7 um as well as hardness values of about 1100 HV 50. It was also observed that the depth <b>of</b> <b>harden</b> <b>layer</b> and hardness value was significantly decreases with increase in scanning speed or with decreasing operating current. Microstructure analysis on <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> also revealed the formation of martensite structure. Single pass scanning treatment produced approximately 2 mm width <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> surface. Larger area <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> surface could be produced by multiple pass scanning treatment. However the treatment produced uneven hardness due to reheating effect on prior <b>hardened</b> <b>layer.</b> The results from this work indicate that plasma arc is viable tool for surface hardening...|$|R
40|$|Structures of {{carburized}} layers {{after the}} surface saturation process in gaseous, liquid or solid medium and after subsequent heat treatment (hardening and low-temperature tempering) consist mainly of high carbon plate martensite {{with a certain}} portion of retained austenite. The presence of retained austenite (RA) in carburized layers is mostly considered as undesirable because it decreases hardness <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> and furthermore, a spontaneous conversion to a ferritic-carbide mixture of a bainitic type, accompanied by a change of properties, dimensional instability and the local increase in internal stress with the possible formation of cracks, can occur. The proportion of retained austenite is, therefore, a significant characteristics of the quality <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>layers.</b> This work deals with {{the evaluation of the}} volume fraction of retained austenite in carburized layers using image analysis on metallographic images...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{hardness}} of industrial parts which {{are subject to}} high wear is usually treated by surface hardening processes. For hardened surfaces, it is desirable to know both the {{surface hardness}} value and the depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer.</b> Ultrasonic testing {{has been used to}} nondestructively measure the depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> surface <b>layer.</b> The technique is based on the detection of the transition between different polycrystalline structures due to their variation in backscattering characteristics. Increase of the grain size increases the backscattering of ultrasonic waves. The <b>hardened</b> top <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the part has small grains while the base material has larger grains. Accordingly, the <b>hardened</b> top <b>layer</b> structure is transparent to ultrasonic waves while the coarse-grained base material structure exhibits considerable ultrasonic backscattering, which results in signal amplitudes suitable for display. However, if the depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> is very small, the discrimination of the backscattered echoes becomes very difficult. Special signal processing techniques including Wiener filtering and autoregressive spectral extrapolation have been used to overcome this problem. Using an immersion ultrasonic system, the depth <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> has been measured on a number of induction-hardened specimens. These specimens are then subjected to destructive tests. Comparison of the results indicates that the application of signal processing techniques have significantly improved the capability of ultrasonic measurements...|$|R
