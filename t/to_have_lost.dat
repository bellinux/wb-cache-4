5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal {{that the city was}} directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix {{on more than one}} lineage.|$|E

5|$|The Chiroptera {{as a whole}} are in {{the process}} of losing the ability to {{synthesize}} vitamin C: most have lost it completely. In a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the ability to synthesize it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation. Earlier reports of only fruit bats being deficient were based on smaller samples. However, recent results show that there are at least two species of bat, the frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he gained}} a {{reputation}} as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a pub, and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two transplants at the age of 55, after which he swore off alcohol. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> between £250,000 and £500,000. After he died of pancreatic cancer in 2001, his funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral and his ashes were buried at Rangers' Ibrox Stadium. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, Hill of Beath.|$|E
5|$|At Somnia, {{the hero}} meets Carver, which doesn't seem to {{remember}} the hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military which gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower.

After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and himself and the hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro-Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro-Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The {{defenders}} were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were undermined by disputes between the French and Spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for the French and the last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for the French and Bourbon Spanish side, which was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> $150,000 on the trip. The Titans finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats. The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development {{made it possible to}} run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
