Weaver and SEAL Command Master Chief Miller are among the response to a panicked call about 'demons'. A gate is discovered nearby. A team is sent through and triggers a fierce alien counterattack that the local human defenses barely manage to push back through the gate. Later, a second wave comes though this and other gates.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes {{cardinal}} orientation and is signed as east–west {{from that point}} on. The freeway continues parallel to <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> River through suburban areas north of Capital Region International Airport.

The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, {{he was given}} the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film <b>The</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> Murders). In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him. The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra. In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg.
