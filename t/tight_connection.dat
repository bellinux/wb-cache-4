5|$|Tătărescu became {{leader of}} the cabinet in January 1934, as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 (the five-day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured {{transition}} between the two governments). His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol's reign, and the latter's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a <b>tight</b> <b>connection</b> being established between Carol and the young liberals, with Tătărescu backing the process leading {{to the creation of}} a royal dictatorship. One of Tătărescu's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest, Dem I. Dobrescu (who was backed by the National Peasants' Party) — making use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January.|$|E

25|$|Historiography {{is divided}} over the {{possibility}} of Pătrășcanu having initially allied himself with the PCR's second in command, Ana Pauker, in her post-war confrontation with Gheorghiu-Dej. It is apparent that Pătrășcanu was alarmed by Pauker's close cooperation with Soviet overseers, and especially by her <b>tight</b> <b>connection</b> with Dmitry Manuilsky; it was also contended that Pauker was intrigued by Pătrășcanu's self-promotion in front of Soviet overseers during late 1944. Under arrest, however, Pătrășcanu asserted that he was closest to Pauker and Teohari Georgescu among the Romanian party leaders.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss {{the concept of the}} Clustering Coefficient as is used with regard to the {{connectivity}} between people or organizations. The paper will use an example of a hypothetical group of people as would be found on a small project team to determine a possible best range for the coupling coefficient to resolve the optimal number of <b>tight</b> and loose <b>connections.</b> The concept of diminishing marginal returns and the tradeoff between <b>tight</b> and loose <b>connections</b> will be examined to determine how <b>tight</b> <b>connections</b> may actually destroy options on exchanging information with other people, and thus lower the value of the organization. The concept of the coupling coefficient will then be applied to discuss the concept of Loose Coupling as is often applied to hardware and software systems, or systems of systems. The goal of this section of the paper will be to determine a framework to examine the level of coupling between subsystems in a system of systems, and to then determine to what degree a system is coupled, with possible implications to the difficulty and costs for spiral developing the subsystems. Coupling to standards will be presented as analogous to limiting the <b>tight</b> <b>connections</b> between people...|$|R
