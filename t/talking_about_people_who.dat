There, she grows up and faces challenges in the urban North, such as learning to read and discrimination. [...] preparation for writing a novel with the heavy issue of slavery as the basis of the book, Ms. Porter did extensive research about 1864 to accurately portray the era and environment to help the reader achieve a real sense of being in 1864.

Moreover, a user study conducted around the pictorial translation system reveals that users found the system to generally produce correct word/image associations, and rate the system as interactive and intelligent...|$|E

There are examples dating from Greek mythology and pre-Columbian goddesses {{up to the present}} in which women can be observed with thread in their hands. Thread is the framework of the research because of its symbolic value. Thread opens a window of interpretations and metaphors depending on the circumstances in which it is used. Furthermore, these symbolic connections are apparent in the unconscious metaphoric uses of verbs such as ?spin? and ?weave? to represent the linking together of thoughts and words into narrative patterns. One of the expressions most commonly used when <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are in government is that ?they pull the strings,? implying by this that they have the power to move society at their will. In this sense, the thread is a metaphor of control and power that a few have over many. The dissertation is based on an extensive reading of different areas such as anthropology, Greek mythology, indigenous studies and current literary works. The ultimate outcome creates a unique interdisciplinary perspective on women studies. The investigation demonstrates that the tasks resulting from manipulating yarn such as spinning and weaving have given women a sense of empowerment with which {{they have been able to}} express and denounce the abuses they have been victims of, and I also prove that what began as an imposition or occupation has become an asset as women have slowly learned to master these skills...|$|E
