40|$|Birds often lose {{feathers}} during predation attempts, {{and this}} ability has evolved {{as a means}} of escape. Because predators are more likely to grab feathers on the rump and the back than on the ventral side of an escaping bird, we predicted that the former feathers would have evolved to be relatively loosely attached as an antipredator strategy in species that frequently die from predation. We estimated the force required to remove feathers from the rump, back, and breast by pulling feathers with a spring balance from a range of European bird species in an attempt to investigate ecological factors associated with ease of feather loss during predation attempts. The force required <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> feather from the rump was less than that required <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> feather from back, which in turn was less than that required <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> feather from the breast. The relative force needed <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> rump feathers compared with feathers from the back and the breast was smaller for prey species preferred by the most common predator of small passerine birds, the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus. Likewise, the relative force was also smaller in species with a high frequency of complete tail loss among free-living birds, which we used as an index of the frequency of failed predation attempts. The relative force required to remove feathers from the rump was smaller in species with a high frequency of fear screams, another measure of the relative importance of predation as a cause of death. Feather loss required particularly little force among solitarily breeding bird species that suffer the highest degree of predation. Antipredator defense in terms of force required to remove feathers from the rump was larger in species with a strong antiparasite defense in terms of T-cell [...] mediated immune response. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that different defenses are antagonistic and that they are traded off against each other.

According to the principal-agent theory, this system gives them a power to control over the Boards of Education by mayors. The following is the finding of this research. In some municipalities, mayors tend to strengthen a control over the Boards of Education: on the other hand, in the other municipalities, mayors tend <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> control over the Boards of Education.

40|$|Every time we push a {{door open}} or tighten a bolt using a wrench, we apply {{a force that}} results in a {{rotational}} motion about a fixed axis. Through experience we learn that where the force is applied and how the force is applied {{is just as important}} as how much force is applied when we want to make something rotate. This tutorial discusses the dynamics of an object rotating about a fixed axis and introduces the concepts of torque and moment of inertia. These concepts allows us to get a better understanding of why pushing a door towards its hinges is not very a very effective way to make it open, why using a longer wrench makes it easier <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> tight bolt, etc. This module begins by looking at the kinetic energy of rotation and by defining a quantity known as the moment of inertia which is the rotational analog of mass.

5000|$|The Marlin Model 70P, {{also known}} as the Marlin Papoose, is a [...]22 Long Rifle {{semi-automatic}} rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 in in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires <b>loosening</b> <b>a</b> barrel retention <b>nut</b> by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.|$|R
50|$|A muscle's {{moment arm}} {{is defined as}} the {{perpendicular}} distance from the muscle's line of action to the joint's center of rotation. As a general rule, the larger the moment arm of a muscle, the greater torque it can produce with the same amount of force. At the same time, the muscle would cause a smaller change in joint angle for the same amount of length change. As an example, holding a wrench {{at the very end of}} the handle (point B) makes it easier <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> bolt, however, requires your hand to travel a greater distance compared to holding the wrench closer to the bolt (point A). Although both the cheetah and greyhound are similar in size, the cheetah can attain speeds nearly twice as fast as the greyhound. This can be explained partly by the finding that moment arms of muscles at the knee and ankle joint in the cheetah are proportionally larger than those of the greyhound. A similar comparison can be made between two similar species of lizards. It was found that geckoes more adapted for climbing have greater hip and shoulder retractor moment arms. Geckoes adapted for horizontal locomotion have greater knee and ankle extensor moment arms.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{present a}} method to {{determine}} the position and orientation of the mean optimal flexion axis of the elbow in vivo {{to be used in}} clinical research. Design. Registering the movements of the forearm with respect to the upper arm during five cycles of flexion and extension of the elbow using a 6 degrees-of-freedom electromagnetic tracking device. Background. Lessening of elbow endoprostheses could be caused by not placing the prostheses in a biomechanically optimal way. To evaluate the placement of endoprostheses with regard <b>to</b> <b>loosening,</b> <b>a</b> method <b>to</b> determine the elbow axis is needed. Methods. The movements of the right forearm with respect to the upper arm during flexion and extension were registered with a 6 degrees-of-freedom electromagnetic tracking device. A mean optimal instantaneous helical axis of 10 elbows was calculated in a coordinate system related to the humerus. Results. The average position of the flexion/extension axis was 0. 81 cm (SD 0. 66 cm) cranially and 1. 86 cm (SD 0. 72 cm) ventrally of the epicondylus lateralis. The average angle with the frontal plane was 15. 3 °(SD 2 °). Conclusions. A useful estimation of the position and orientation of a mean optimal flexion axis can be obtained in vivo...|$|R
50|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that they had asphyxiated. The fault was traced to a breathing ventilation valve, located between the orbital module and the descent module, that had been jolted open as the descent module separated from the service module, 12m 3s after retrofire. The two were held together by explosive bolts designed to fire sequentially; in fact, they had fired simultaneously. The explosive force of the simultaneous bolt firing caused the internal mechanism of the pressure equalization valve <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>a</b> seal that was usually discarded later and which normally allowed for automatic adjustment of the cabin pressure. The valve opened {{at an altitude of}} 168 km, and the resultant loss of pressure was fatal within seconds. The valve was located beneath the seats and was impossible to find and block before the air was lost. Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15m 35s after the retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere. Patsayev's body was found positioned near the valve, and he may have been attempting to close or block the valve at the time he lost consciousness.|$|R
