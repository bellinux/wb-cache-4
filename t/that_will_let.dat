He wrote, “The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don’t card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>let</b> us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children, while targeting the bad actors.” Newsom responded to comments by Spicer which compared cannabis to opioids saying, “Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{chaparral}} {{communities in}} Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire [...] This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) {{and the young}} plants can then capitalize {{on the lack of}} competition in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds. Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>let</b> in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves. Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.|$|E

Between each of the flybys, the spacecraft will have seven to ten days to transmit data stored during each brief encounter. <b>That</b> <b>will</b> <b>let</b> the spacecraft have {{up to a year}} of time to transmit its data compared to just 30 days for an orbiter. The result will be almost three times as much data returned to Earth, while reducing exposure to radiation.

David explains to Arthur about why he knows the story of the love triangle that involved the King, Guinevere and Lancelot. When Arthur asks how Lancelot is, David has to deliver the bad news that he is dead.|$|E
