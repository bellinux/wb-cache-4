40|$|The results {{presented}} in this article identify the role of costs in the scientific and grey freight terminal handling literature and analyses the handling costs of different <b>terminal</b> <b>sizes.</b> The literature review shows that handling costs only play a marginal role in the scientific research in intermodal rail freight terminals (IRT). This is remarkable given the large role costs occupy in decision-making in freight transport. Furthermore, the used cost levels show a wide range of proposed amounts and <b>terminal</b> <b>sizes</b> or handling technologies are seldom addressed. Finally, many of the scientific papers do not make it clear whether the average transhipment cost or market price is referred to. Next, the analysis of the investment in, and cost structure of, IRTs shows that IRT investments are very capital-intensive leading to relatively high average costs per handling. However, given the cost characteristics of IRTs, the average cost per handling represents the underlying cost structure and are – in this sense – representative. The cost analysis demonstrates that extra-large IRTs actually have the lowest average handling costs, followed by small IRTs. </p...|$|R

50|$|Other, non-pharmacological {{evidence}} in support of the dopamine hypothesis relating to the substantia nigra include structural changes in the pars compacta, such as reduction in synaptic <b>terminal</b> <b>size.</b> Other changes in the substantia nigra include increased expression of NMDA receptors in the substantia nigra, and reduced dysbindin expression. Increased NMDA receptors may point to the involvement of glutamate-dopamine interactions in schizophrenia. Dysbindin, which has been (controversially) linked to schizophrenia, may regulate dopamine release, and low expression of dysbindin in the substantia nigra may be important in schizophrenia etiology. Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as neuromelanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Four {{kinds of}} dimers from cyclic peptide [-(1 R, 3 S) -γ-Acc-D-Phe] 3 were {{investigated}} using molecular modeling {{based on the}} density functional theory (DFT), molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD).

In each type of dimers, only one can transport CHCl 3. When the terminal N-substituent methyl is introduced, the transport character is reversed. Analysis of 500 ps MD trajectory suggests that the inner and <b>terminal</b> <b>sizes</b> of the dimers are the main factor that affects the transport of CHCl 3.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{profiling}} and filtering is important particu-larly for mobile information systems where wireless network traffic and mobile <b>terminal’s</b> <b>size</b> are limited comparing to the Internet access from the PC. Dealing with uncertainty {{in this area}} is crucial and many re-searchers apply various probabilistic models. The main challenge of this paper is the multilevel probabilistic model (the Bayesian Metanetwork), which is an extension of traditional Bayesian networks. The extra level(s) in the Metanetwork is used to select the appropriate substructure from the basic network level based on contextual features from user’s profile (e. g. user’s location). Two models of the Metanetwork are considered: C-Metanetwork for managing conditional dependencies and R-Metanetwork for modelling feature selection. The Bayesian Metanetwork is considered as a useful tool to present the second order uncertainty and therefore to predict mobile user’s preferences. ...|$|R

40|$|The ocean {{surgeonfish}} Acanthurus bahianus is {{a common}} inhabitant of reefs throughout the west and central Atlantic. We examined geographic variation in its demography among 10 locations spanning 56 ° of latitude. These populations exhibit a great diversity of growth trajectories, as well as 3 -fold variation in <b>terminal</b> <b>size</b> and maximum longevity. There are strongly contrasting patterns of habitat variation in demography at 2 sites: at Bermuda, fish settle inshore, grow to about asymptotic size and then, when 2 to 6 yr old, relocate permanently to outer reefs, where they can reach 32 yr. At Belize, fish settle and attain 10 yr on both inner and outer reefs, but grow faster and reach a ~ 50 % greater asymptotic weight on inner reefs. Habitat differences in growth at Belize largely span the range of variation among NW Atlantic locations. A. bahianus exhibits the fastest growth known for an acanthurid, and the strongest spatial variation in demography known for a tropical reef-fish. Maximum age, adult survivorship, <b>terminal</b> <b>size</b> and absolute growth rate are inversely related to temperature. However, relative growth rate is not: in all populations a similar percentage of mean asymptotic standard length (L∞) is achieved at 1, 2 and 3 yr, and then growth effectively ceases. Variation in longevity is related to temperature, and is largely independent of size. Variation in growth and size is related strongly to both habitat and temperature effects, {{and the rate of}} growth appears to set <b>terminal</b> <b>size.</b> High longevity at 3 isolated oceanic islands seems to reflect a temperature effect, rather than an island effect...|$|E

40|$|Although {{observers}} can discriminate visual targets {{with long}} exposures from otherwise-identical targets with shorter exposures, temporally overlapping distracters with an intermediate exposure {{can produce a}} striking degradation in performance. This new finding suggests that observers can only estimate one duration at a time. Discrimination {{on the basis of}} size, rather than duration, did not degrade as rapidly with the number of distracters but was still worse than predicted by unlimited-capacity models. The critical difference between estimates of temporal length and estimates of spatial length seems to be that the former can only be made {{at the end of an}} exposure, while the latter can be made at any time during an exposure.
