Inherently, such developing flow conditions give higher species transfer coefficients.

An array of seven parallel semicircular channels (internal diameter = 3. 0 mm, hydraulic diameter = 1. 83 mm, and length = 200 mm) was milled on a copper substrate (200 × 85 × 5 mm 3). The interchannel pitch was 6. 0 mm. Liquid crystal thermography was employed to measure spatial steady-state distribution of wall/fluid temperatures over the array. This technique was chosen to (i) obtain spatial field information needed for analyzing developing flows and (ii) overcome the limitations posed by conventional techniques when employed on small geometries.

40|$|In this book, a multi-physics {{approach}} to the modeling and analysis of nuclear reactor core behavior is presented, and applied to study the dynamics of Molten Salt Reactors (MSR). The Multi-Physics Modeling (MPM) approach is implemented in a unified simulation environment, which results able to catch the synergy between the different phenomena involved in the reactor core behavior, whose modeling would otherwise require either the adoption of existing simulation tools with drastic modifications of their structure and possible loss of significant information or the development of purpose-made numerical codes for the specific analyzed situation. The book is organized into four chapters, which are conceived {{so as to be}} read independently of each other. Here, the rationale of the R&D activities performed at the Politecnico di Milano by the authors, and giving rise to the book contents, is briefly outlined. In the last years, MSRs {{have been the subject of}} a growing and renewed interest from the scientific community in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum. Due to the availability of an advanced conceptual design, the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 1960 s is usually considered in the literature as reference system for benchmark analyses and validation purposes. Coherently, the MSBR has been chosen as reference configuration for the analyses presented in the book. In such kind of Circulating Fuel Reactor (CFR), like the other MSRs, the coupling between neutronics and <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> is a key issue. This feature cannot be neglected in order to perform an adequate description of the reactor dynamic behavior, which shows peculiar aspects with respect to solid-fuelled conventional nuclear power plants. Relevant differences in terms of safety, fuel cycle and technology also distinguish the MSRs from the other nuclear reactors (Chapter 1). The developed MPM methodology and the adopted models for neutronics and <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> required a deep investigation for what concerns the assessment and the extension of the simulation environment, represented in the specific case by the finite element COMSOL Multiphysics® software (chosen thanks to its flexible and modular numerical structure), but the same methodology can be applied to other multi-physics platforms. As far as <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> is concerned, a generalized approach was developed (Chapter 2) and exploited for the assessment of COMSOL simulations (Chapter 3), making use of a dedicated finite volume computational fluid dynamics code (FLUENT®), in order to better appreciate the differences in numerical approaches to turbulence. The generalized approach was built in order to carefully take into account the molten salt mixture specificities (i. e., a fuel that operates also as coolant), the reactor core power conditions and the heat transfer in graphite. In this context, a Nusselt number correlation was developed, which takes into account the effect of internal heat generation on fluid heat transfer characteristics. As far as neutronics is concerned, a module for the "reactor physics" was built in the COMSOL environment of simulation, and allowed to extend the potentialities of this computing platform. Numerical results were assessed by means of: (i) a code-to-code comparison with dedicated neutron transport codes, in the case of static fuel; (ii) a comparison with simplified neutron kinetics models, representative of the zero-power dynamics, in the case of circulating fuel. After the assessment of the COMSOL capabilities to cope with the adopted models for neutronics and <b>thermo-hydrodynamics,</b> the MPM approach was applied to study the dynamic behavior of a single-channel representative of the average conditions of the MSBR core (Chapter 4). For this case study, the MPM approach resulted particularly suitable because of the strong non-linear coupling between the fuel motion and neutron dynamics, which requires a careful description of the time-space distribution of the physical quantities. Several different transients were analyzed, such as those driven by: reactivity variations due to control rod movements; fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the primary pump working conditions; presence of periodic perturbations, due to local precipitation of fissile solid compounds within the molten salt mixture. The analyses gave significant information on the MSBR dynamic behavior and highlighted the several advantages and potentialities offered by the proposed MPM approach (for instance, the "modularity", namely the possibility to include other physical phenomena and couplings). These potentialities are of more general interest in the prospect of studying the design configuration, the dynamics and the control strategy of next generation MSRs, as well as of other nuclear reactor types...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFluids, and {{especially}} cryogenic fluids like Hydrogen H 2 and Oxygen O 2, {{are widely used}} in space technology for propulsion and cooling. The knowledge of fluid behaviour during the acceleration variation and under reduced gravity is necessary for an efficient management of fluids in space.

Simulations are carried out for a range of Capillary number and length of liquid plugs. It has been found that variation in dynamic contact angle leads to enhanced local and average heat transfer coefficient in the moving liquid plug; the local fluid circulation being affected by meniscus deformations.

In most cases the large scale parallelism of the applications uses MPI, widely recognized as the de-facto standard for building parallel applications, while several programming languages are used to express the parallelism available in the application and map it onto the parallel resources available on GPUs. Regular grids and stencil codes are used in a subset of these applications, often corresponding to computational 'Grand Challenges'. One such class of applications are Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LB) used in computational fluid dynamics. The regular structure of LB algorithms makes them suitable for processor architectures with a large degree of parallelism like GPUs.

This type of flow is especially encountered inside Pulsating Heat Pipes (PHP), in which the self-sustained thermally driven oscillating flow is generated by evaporation/condensation mass exchange process. Specialized and dedicated range of experiments was conducted using High Speed Videography (HSV), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Infra-Red Thermography (IRT). New understanding of the local <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> of Taylor bubbles and slugs was obtained owing to a specific experimental test bench in which the working fluid and the operating temperatures could be chosen by the user. The experimental results clearly showed that evaporation of the thin film is responsible for the oscillation patterns that are observed. In addition, experimental results obtained using a mechanical oscillation system in isothermal conditions show that classical correlations used to calculate pressure drops inside the liquid slug are quite satisfactory, in the case of this particular oscillating flow. PIV and IRT for non-boiling two-phase systems, both in adiabatic/diabatic conditions and oscillating/non-oscillating flows were also undertaken. Evaporation of the laid down liquid thin-film during motion of an isolated partially wetting liquid plug revealed that the hydrodynamic considerations of Taylor's law for predicting thin-film thickness is well able to predict the evaporative mass flux under diabatic conditions. Various flow aspects of liquid plugs were delineated. It is believed that such fundamental studies will provide the necessary framework for 'unit-cell' modelling approach of pulsating heat pipes...|$|E

In this paper we consider two recent classes of GPU boards based on the Fermi and Kepler architectures; we describe in details all steps done to implement and optimize our LB code and analyze its performance first on single-GPU systems, and then on parallel multi-GPU systems based on one node {{as well as on}} a cluster of many nodes; in the latter case we use CUDA-aware MPI as an abstraction layer to assess the advantages of advanced GPU-to-GPU communication technologies like GPUDirect. On our implementation, aggregate sustained performance of the most compute intensive part of the code breaks the 1 double-precision Tflops barrier on a single-host system with two GPUs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach {{developed for the}} study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5. 1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i. e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{has been carried}} out to understand the <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> of single phase flow with obstacle in microchannel. In this study, two different shapes of obstacle are analyzed with five different substrate materials to study the effect of thermal conductivity on the heat transfer. Uniform heating source is present at bottom wall of microchannel and remaining walls are kept adiabatic. The flow rate is maintained such that flow will be laminar theoretically. But under influence of obstacle, fluid is likely to get disturbed as it flows past the obstacle. So, both laminar and turbulent model was used in this analysis. The other factor is considered is the position of obstacle in the flow. The positions of obstacle affect the mixing of layer of fluid. Analysis revels that position of obstacle in the flow field directly affect the heat transfer. Disturbance created at the initial stage carried to long distance which enhance heat transfer coefficient. It is found that the temperature difference between wall and fluid increase along the axial direction of flow except near the obstacle. In analysis, it is found that shape of obstacle directly affect the Nusselt number, for half obstacle variation of Nusselt number increase vibrantly as compared to full obstacle. In case of laminar model, it does not take account of eddies formation near the flow. Nor it accounts the surface roughness. While in turbulent model, eddies formation near the surface can be seen which in turn increase Nusselt number, when simulating both full and half obstacle using both laminar and turbulent model, it is found that higher Nusselt number is found in case of turbulent model, hence Nusselt number is reach to maximum in turbulent in comparison to laminar model...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the zero-power {{behavior}} of circulating fuel reactors (CFRs) {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} zero-dimensional neutron kinetics model that provides a simplified but useful approach to the simulation of the dynamics of this class of nuclear reactors. Among CFRs, the most promising is the molten salt reactor (MSR), {{which is one of the}} six innovative concepts of reactor proposed by the “Generation IV International Forum” for future nuclear energy supply. One of the key features of CFRs is represented by the fission material, which is dissolved in a liquid mixture that serves both as fuel and coolant. This causes a relevant coupling between neutronics and <b>thermo-hydrodynamics,</b> so that fuel velocity plays a relevant role in determining the dynamic performance of such systems. In the present study, a preliminary model has been developed that is based on the zero-power kinetics equations (i. e., reactivity feedbacks due to temperature change are neglected), modified in order to take into account the effects of the molten salt circulation on the drift of delayed neutron precursors. The system dynamic behavior has been analyzed using the theory of linear systems, and the transfer functions of the neutron density with respect to both reactivity and fuel velocity have been calculated. The developed model has been assessed on the basis of the available experimental data from the molten salt reactor experiment (MSRE) provided by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The results of the present work show that the developed simplified theoretical model is well descriptive of the MSRE zero-power dynamics, allowing a preliminary evaluation of the effects due to the circulation of the fuel salt on the neutronics of the system. Moreover, the model is of general validity for any kind of CFRs, and hence is applicable to study other MSR concepts in order to have some indications on the control strategy to be adopted in the MSR development envisaged by Generation IV...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there has been}} a rapid growth of {{research}} and development activities on high temperature molten salts for nuclear and non-nuclear applications. The study of their heat transfer characteristics is a key issue in the current development of the molten salt reactor (MSR) {{that is one of the}} innovative nuclear reactors proposed by the Generation IV International Forum. The MSR is a sort of circulating fuel reactor (CFR), which adopts a molten halide salt mixture containing the fissile material and playing the distinctive role of both fuel and coolant. In a thermal-neutron-spectrum MSR, the reactor core is composed by a graphite matrix (neutron moderator), through which the liquid nuclear fuel flows and leads to a strong and intrinsic coupling between <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> and neutronics. This peculiar feature requires a suitable and qualified multi-physics simulation environment for a proper description of the system (fuel/coolant+graphite) behaviour. With reference to such complex and non-linear system, the present work is intended to give two different but linked contributions, in the perspective of a multi-physics modelling able to accurately describe the synergy of the involved different physical phenomena (e. g., by means of COMSOL Multiphysics® software). I. On one hand, this work is aimed at establishing a useful validation framework for the assessment of computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) analyses of liquids with internal heat generation. For this purpose, an analytic approach for both fluid velocity and temperature fields in a circular pipe surrounded by a solid region has been developed. It is an extension of the approach elaborated for pipe flow in (Di Marcello, V., Cammi, A., Luzzi, L., 2010. A generalized approach to heat transfer in pipe flow with internal heat generation. Chemical Engineering Science 65, 1301 - 1310), in order to take into account the heat conduction in the solid domain (represented by the graphite matrix in the specific case of interest). II. On the other hand, the paper presents a preliminary investigation of the thermal-hydraulic behaviour occurring in a typical graphite-moderated MSR core channel. The developed analytic approach has been conveniently applied to this case study: (i) by testing the capabilities of COMSOL Multiphysics® to evaluate the heat transfer characteristics and the hydrodynamic behaviour of such system; and (ii) by investigating the applicability of correlations for the Nusselt number to fluids with internal heat generation. For a deeper insight into the numerical solutions provided by COMSOL, a code-to-code comparison has been also carried out, adopting a dedicated CFD finite volume software (i. e., FLUENT®). As a result, a satisfactory agreement has been found between the analytic solution and the numerical computations provided by COMSOL and FLUENT for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. As concerns the Nusselt number evaluation, the correlations usually adopted for molten salts have been proved as unsuitable for the analysed system, whereas the correlation advanced in the above mentioned paper (that explicitly takes account of the internal heat source) appears more appropriate. The results of the present work are thought to be useful because they provide: i) a "generalized" analytic approach to the heat transfer that is applicable in a more general context; ii) an insight into the heat transfer characteristics of the considered graphite-moderated MSR core channel; and iii) a preliminary assessment of computations that is essential in view of the adoption of multi-physics tools (like COMSOL) for more complex and representative simulations of the dynamic behaviour of the molten salt reactor, and more in general of other kinds of CFRs...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{transfer}} in pipe flow {{has been extensively}} investigated in the past. Many different models have been proposed and adopted to predict the velocity profile, the eddy diffusivity, the temperature distributions, the friction factor and the heat transfer coefficient (Kays et al., 2004; Schlichting & Gersten, 2000). However, the majority of such studies give {{a description of the}} problem for non-internally heated fluids. Models regarding fluids with internal heat generation have been developed more than 50 years ago (Kinney & Sparrow, 1966; Poppendiek, 1954; Siegel & Sparrow, 1959), giving in most cases a partial treatment of the problem in terms of boundary conditions and heat source distribution, and relying on a turbulent flow treatment that does not seem fully satisfactory in the light of more recent investigations (Churchill, 1997; 2002; Kays, 1994; Zagarola & Smits, 1997). Internally heated fluids are of great interest in the current development of Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) (LeBlanc, 2010), included as one of the six innovative nuclear reactors selected by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV, 2002) for a more sustainable version of nuclear power. MSRs are circulating fuel reactors (Nicolino et al., 2008), which employ a non-classical (fluid-type) fuel constituted by a molten halide (fluoride or chloride) salt mixture playing the distinctive role of both heat source and coolant. By adopting classical correlations for the Nusselt number (e. g., Dittus-Boelter), the heat transfer coefficient of the MSR fuel can be overestimated by a non-negligible amount (Di Marcello et al., 2008). In the case of thermal-neutron-spectrum (graphite-moderated) MSRs (LeBlanc, 2010), this has significant consequences on the core temperature predictions and on the reactor dynamic behaviour (Luzzi et al., 2011). Such influence of the heat source within the fluid cannot be neglected, and thus required proper investigation. The present chapter deals with this critical issue, first summarizing the main modelling efforts carried out by the authors (Di Marcello et al., 2010; Luzzi et al., 2010) to investigate the <b>thermo-hydrodynamics</b> of internally heated fluids, and then focusing on the heat transfer coefficient prediction that is relevant for analysing the molten salt behaviour encountered in MSRs. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 provides {{a brief description of the}} Molten Salt Reactors, focusing on their distinctive features, in terms of both sustainability (i. e., reduced radioactive waste generation, effective use of natural resources) and safety, with respect to the traditional configuration of nuclear reactors. Section 3 deals with the study of molten salt heat transfer characteristics, which represent a key issue in the current development of MSRs. In particular, a "generalized approach" to evaluate the steady-state temperature distribution in a representative power channel of the reactor core is presented. This approach incorporates recent formulations of turbulent flow and convection (Churchill, 1997; 2002), and is built in order to carefully take into account the molten salt mixture specificities, the reactor core power conditions and the heat transfer in the graphite core structure. In Section 4, a preliminary correlation for the Nusselt number prediction is advanced in the case of simultaneous uniform wall heat flux and internal heat generation, on the basis of the results achieved by means of the presented generalized approach. In Section 5, the main conclusions of the present study are summarized...|$|E
