40|$|Retracing the {{financial}} revolutions {{that took place}} in continental Europe in the 19 th century, this work focuses on investment banking patterns’ comparison in France, Germany and, especially, Italy, in the long run. Besides supporting the industrialization process, in fact, major large investment banks probably represented the most important financial innovation after the establishment of issuing banks and of standardized <b>tradable</b> <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> As such, they had a relevant role in building and shaping those countries’ emerging financial and credit systems, giving birth to modern banking. The paper considers great banks’ evolution between the 1860 s and the Great War, verifying and assessing differences and similarities among them, taking into consideration the structure of single banks. Quantitative analysis shows that relevant differences emerged in the evolution of investment banking patterns in the three countries before 1914. The deepening of these differences during the period supports the hypothesis that divergence, rather than convergence, characterized investment banking patterns in continental Europe. The paper eventually tries to give reasons for such an outcome referring to institutional frameworks’ peculiarities, rather than relying on classical explanations involving the permanence of economic growth differentials among countries or of different speeds in their economic convergence...|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> dynamics {{with a view to}} assess the optimal size and composition of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> in Zimbabwe that is consistent with maintaining <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> at sustainable levels. The analysis was performed by applying <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> data for Zimbabwe over the period 1980 to 2012. Robustness checks were conducted, using data for selected low income countries in the sub-Saharan Africa. The study was motivated by the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> management concerns caused by the 2008 / 09 global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis as well as the external <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> overhang experienced by Zimbabwe since the year 2000. The findings of the study complement existing research findings and information on <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> management of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other researchers. The major contribution of this thesis is the determination of optimal <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> thresholds for Zimbabwe. The optimal <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> thresholds were estimated from a joint analysis of the macroeconomic variables that affect <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> and the reaction of fiscal policy to changes in debt. The classical linear regression and Bayesian Vector Auto Regression (BVAR) models were applied to examine the drivers of debt accumulation and to assess the sensitivity of debt to macroeconomic shocks. The information from the drivers of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> accumulation, together with the fiscal response mechanism was used to calibrate the long-run stable (optimal) <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> target. The optimal <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> threshold was also determined by assessing the link between <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> and economic growth. This assessment was carried out to establish the tipping point beyond which <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> adversely affects growth. Such a tipping point provides valuable information on the optimal size of <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> The study also applied simulation approaches to determine the optimal composition of <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> The results show that <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> dynamics in Zimbabwe largely comprised extensive stock flow adjustments emanating from extra budgetary expenditures to meet social and political related needs. The results of the assessment on the sensitivity of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to macroeconomic shocks show that Zimbabwe‟s <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> has been more vulnerable to economic growth, exchange rate and interest rate shocks. The significant influence of these variables highlights the role of automatic <b>debt</b> dynamics in <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> management. The results from the fiscal reaction function show that government has been responding positively to increases in <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> This analysis also shows that government‟s policies are a-cyclical; as explained by the negative and insignificant response of the primary balance to the output gap. The dynamic stochastic simulation analysis suggests that Zimbabwe‟s <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> could follow an array of potential paths depending on the policy stance implemented by government. The simulated risk to <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> dynamics is larger, with an upper bound <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP ratio of 100 per cent and a lower bound <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> ratio of 32 per cent. The simulated lower bound provides a measure of a natural debt limit, which the government could adopt without fearing the risk of default. The results suggest that the main risks to <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> sustainability lie in growth shocks, whose volatility have been high for the period under study. The results from the analysis of growth and debt confirm the existence of an optimal growth maximising <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> ratio depicted by an inverted U-shaped relationship between <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> and economic growth. The optimal size of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> was found to be at <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> levels of between 45 - 50 per cent of GDP. This means that higher <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> ratios have been associated with lower economic growth rates at debt levels above 50 per cent of GDP. The results are consistent with empirical findings for low income countries which suggest the existence of a debt laffer-curve. The results from an analysis of an optimal composition of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> show a trade-off between a debt composition with more external concessional debt and one with more domestic debt. While a composition with more concessional borrowing was found to be desirable from a cost perspective, it proved to be less desirable from a risk perspective after taking into consideration stock flow adjustments due to changes in cross exchange rates. The findings of the study point to a need for the Zimbabwean government to swiftly respond to increases in <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> to control the swings in debt dynamics caused by macroeconomic shocks. The inverted U-shaped relationship between debt and growth suggests that government borrowing must be done in a way that simultaneously entrenches debt sustainability and ensures sustained economic growth rates in the medium to long-term. The study also highlights the need for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies to avoid explosive debt dynamics emanating from frequent changes in the business cycle, and to minimise the interest/growth rate differential to ensure sustainable <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> dynamics. There is also a need for authorities to ensure a true balance between external and domestic borrowing to minimise the volatility in debt service costs caused by macroeconomic shocks. Generally, the findings from this study can assist in informing the policy agenda to address the imperatives of debt resolution, fiscal consolidation and economic growth acceleration...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Government {{bonds are}} {{interest-bearing}} assets. Increasing <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> increases wealth, income, and consumption demand. The smaller government ex-penditure is, the larger consumption demand {{must be in}} equilibrium, and the larger must be <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> Conversely, lower <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> implies higher government spending and taxation. <b>Public</b> <b>debt</b> plays, thus, {{an important role in}} establishing equilibrium.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically examines predominant political-economic {{theories of}} public credit and <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> {{in light of}} the origins, development, and recent record expansion in such debt. Using a "history of thought" approach, I focus on those aspects of theory, from three main schools of thought - Classical, Keynesian, and Public Choice - which seek to explain the evolution of <b>public</b> <b>debt,</b> its political-economic causes and effects, the meaning of sustainability in <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> burdens, and the conditions under which governments are likely to monetize or repudiate their debts. For empirical context, I also provide three centuries of data on <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> for major nations, relative to their national income, and government bond-yield data for more recent decades. There is value in classifying the major political economists who have examined public credit and <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> since 1700 as "pessimists," "optimists" or "realists. " <b>Public</b> <b>debt</b> pessimists argue that government provides no truly productive services, that its taxing and borrowing detract from the private economy, while unfairly burdening future generations, and that high and rising public leverage ratios are unsustainable and will likely cause national insolvency and long-term economic ruin. When <b>public</b> <b>debts</b> become excessive or un-payable, pessimists advise explicit default or deliberate repudiation. <b>Public</b> <b>debt</b> pessimists also believe financiers in general and public bondholders in particular are unproductive. Pessimists usually endorse smaller-sized governments and free markets. With few exceptions, most <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> pessimists appear in the Classical or Public Choice schools of thought. Among prominent <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> pessimists, the most representative are David Hume and Adam Smith. <b>Public</b> <b>debt</b> optimists believe that government provides not only productive services, such as infrastructure and social insurance, but means to mitigate what they perceived to be "market failures," including savings gluts, economic depressions, inflation, and secular stagnation. Optimists contend that deficit-spending and <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> accumulation can stimulate or sustain economy activity and ensure full employment, without burdening present or future generation. To the extent <b>public</b> <b>debts</b> become excessive or un-payable, optimists tend to advise implicit default, by official and deliberate debasement of the national currency (inflation). As do pessimists, <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> optimists view financiers and bondholders as essentially unproductive. Optimists also defend a relatively larger economic role for the state. Almost without exception, optimists reside in the Keynesian school of political-economic thought. Among the leading optimists, the most representative are Alvin Hansen and Abba Lerner. <b>Public</b> <b>debt</b> realists contend that government can and should provide certain productive services, mainly national defense, police protection, courts of justice, and basic infrastructure, but that social and redistributive schemes tend to undermine national prosperity. Realists say <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> should fund only services and projects that help a free economy maximize its potential, and that analysis must be contextualized - i. e., related to a nation's credit capacity, productivity, and taxable capacity. According to realists, public leverage is neither inevitably harmful, as pessimists say, nor infinite, as optimists say. Realists view financiers as productive and insist that sovereigns redeem their <b>public</b> <b>debts</b> in full, on time, and in sound money. Realists favor constitutionally-limited yet energetic governments that help promote robust markets. They appear mainly in the Classical era of political-economic thought. The most representative and renowned of the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> realists are Sir James Steuart and Alexander Hamilton. My main thesis is that <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> realists provide the most persuasive theories of public credit and <b>public</b> <b>debt,</b> and thus the most plausible interpretations of the long, fascinating history of <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> Moreover, certain puzzles and paradoxes arising in contemporary <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> experience, among developed nations - including the recent, multi-decade trend of simultaneously rising public-leverage ratios and declining <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> yields - is explicable primarily in realist terms. In contrast, <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> pessimists and optimists alike offer unbalanced, inadequate accounts of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> experience. Whereas pessimists are too often confused or mistaken in foreseeing an alleged "inevitable" ruin from <b>public</b> <b>debt,</b> optimists more often than not are confused and mistaken about the alleged "stimulus" attainable by large-scale deficit-spending and debt build-ups. Looking ahead, the realist perspective is likely to provide superior guideposts for maximally-accurate interpretations of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> policies and trends. Dissertatio...|$|R

Empirical evidence shows that population growth and <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> have played very crucial role towards economic growth in Jordan. It shows that <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> has promoted economic growth, while population growth has hindered it. Thus, if Jordan is hoping to attain sustained economic growth, positive effect of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> should be maintained while negative effect of population growth should be reduced...|$|R

My analysis addresses two questions. What is the optimal fiscal instrument {{the government needs}} to use to reduce <b>public</b> <b>debt?</b> What is the optimal speed of <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> deleveraging? The main finding is that <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> should be reduced quickly and by cutting public expenditure. If the fiscal authority is forced to use income taxation instead, <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> deleveraging needs to be slow. Independently of fiscal instruments, the economy may end up in a liquidity trap. I show that, in my model, the zero lower bound has a redistributive effect. If the liquidity trap is very persistent, it can reallocate resources from financially constrained agents to financially unconstrained ones. Due to this mechanism, a very slow <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> reduction achieved by increasing income taxation is very costly in terms of aggregate welfare...|$|R

The link starts from the Maastricht criterion for participation in EMU concerning <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> and its reference value of 60 % of GDP. The Maastricht criterion on <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> stipulates that if <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> exceeds 60 % of GDP, it must be ‘sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace’'. This note provides a numerical rule for evaluating whether <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> is indeed diminishing ‘at a satisfactory pace’. This numerical rule is in accordance with the reference values in the Treaty and could be used as the basis for an ‘excessive debt procedure’...|$|R

Using data {{up to the}} end of 2008 this report will present these cross-country differences and will also highlight the similarities and general trends for the region as a whole. We use as input the information provided by the <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> offices of the region in response to a questionnaire specially created for this purpose. The questionnaire intended to compile up-to-date standardized <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> statistics to conduct crosscountry comparisons over clear, objective and homogeneous definitions of <b>public</b> <b>debt.</b> ...|$|R

The aim of the thesis is to analyze the structure and hitory of US national debt {{and its impact on the}} selected investment instruments development. Theoretical introduction is followed by analysis of the causes of the so high <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> of the United States. The analysis is based on the structure and <b>public</b> <b>debt</b> history.
