2500|$|The anatta {{doctrine}} {{is not a}} kind of materialism. Buddhism does not deny the existence of [...] "immaterial" [...] entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states. Thus, the conventional translation of anatta as [...] "no-soul" [...] can be confusing. If the word [...] "soul" [...] simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny {{the existence of the}} soul. Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in Cartesianism. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no [...] "thinker" [...] behind them. When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body. Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died. However, the new being is continuous with the being that died – {{in the same way that}} the [...] "you" [...] of this moment is continuous with the [...] "you" [...] of a moment before, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> constantly changing.|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{you intend}} now to φ at some future time t. However, when t has {{come you do}} not φ. Something has gone wrong. This failing {{is not just a}} causal but also a {{normative}} failing. This raises the question how to characterize this failing. I discuss three alternative views. On the first view, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not execute your intention to φ is blameworthy only if the balance of reasons pointed to φ-ing. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> intended to u does not add to the reasons for φ-ing at t. On the second view, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not execute your intention to φ is blameworthy because you violate a requirement of rationality. Both these views have in common that they deny that intending to φ at t creates a reason to φ at t. The third alternative, the one I defend, claims <b>that</b> <b>you</b> often create reasons to φ by intending to φ...|$|R
