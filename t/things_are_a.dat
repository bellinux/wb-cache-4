25|$|Kashmir Shaivism is philosophically {{similar to}} yet {{distinguished}} from Advaita: both are non-dual philosophies that give primacy to Universal Consciousness (Chit or Brahman). However, in Kashmir Shaivism, all <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of this Consciousness but the phenomenal world (Śakti) is real, existing and having its being in Consciousness (Chit), while Advaita Vedanta {{holds that the}} supreme, Brahman, is inactive (niṣkriya) and that the phenomenal world is an illusion (māyā). The reality and very divinity of {{every aspect of the}} phenomenal world is tied to the Tantric practices of Kashmir Shaivism.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{appreciated}} {{the fact the}} writers {{did not make a}} big deal of defining either characters' sexuality or their romantic relationship. Show creator Rothenberg said labels and gender are not a factor in the series, which Debnam-Carey viewed as true to the story. [...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make it out to be this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement," [...] she said. [...] "It is just that in this world, some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> little better after the apocalypse [...] It kind of represents, in a way, an ideal place where people love people and it doesn't have to be a thing, which I think is really great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sagan came {{in second}} at Milan–San Remo after {{initiating}} a move near the finish on {{the slope of the}} Poggio, bringing with him Michał Kwiatkowski and Julian Alaphilippe. The Pole Kwiatkowski had the better of him in the end after a close sprint on the Via Roma, and he settled for second place. [...] Sagan entered the 2017 Tour of Flanders in hopes of defending his title. [...] With 55km to go, Philippe Gilbert attacked the peloton in a solo breakaway. [...] In an attempt to close that gap, Sagan began to chase with rival Greg Van Avermaet. [...] With 16.9km to go and 59 seconds down, Sagan's handlebar was caught on a jacket draped over the spectator barrier on the Oude Kwaremont causing him to crash, and ruining his chances of victory. [...] Following the race, he stated, [...] "Unfortunately, my crash at the Oude Kwaremont meant it was all over. I don't know how I crashed but these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of cycling." [...] In the 2017 Tour de Suisse, Sagan managed to achieve another two victories - in stages 5 and 8. He also dominated the points classification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} {{of life is}} controversial. The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. However, many other biological definitions have been proposed, {{and there are some}} borderline cases of life, such as viruses. Throughout history, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by [...] "life" [...] and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things, such as materialism, the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it; hylomorphism, the belief that all <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> combination of matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its soul; spontaneous generation, the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life; and vitalism, a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a [...] "life force" [...] or [...] "vital spark". Modern definitions are more complex, with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines. Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems; there are also some living systems theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that the Earth itself is alive. Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems, and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology, a branch or subfield of mathematical biology. Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
