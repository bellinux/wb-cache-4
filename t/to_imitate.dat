50|$|The {{traditional}} {{dress of}} 18th-century Andalusia was {{strongly influenced by}} majismo {{within the context of}} casticismo (purism, traditionalism, authenticity).

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> processes <b>to</b> see {{how they}} behave under different conditions, simulations are also used to test new theories.

40|$|TOMS is a shoe {{company that}} gives away a pair for each pair you buy. In {{light of their}} success, the imitator BOBS entered {{offering}} similar shoe design and the same buy one give one initiative. Corporate Social responsibility (CSR), by its definition, is a noble cause that benefits society, thus, one would expect consumers' response to BOBS would be equally favorable as they didi to TOMS. However, {{this was not the}} case (Jørgensen & Pedersen, 2013). Intrigued by the story of TOMS vs BOBS we arrived to the following decision problem: How can companies that imitate CSR initiatives alleviate unfavorable response from consumers? In order to operationalize this research question, two specific questions were investigated: (1) Can brand equity alleviate consumers' unfavorable response <b>to</b> <b>imitated</b> CSR initiatives, and (2) Can a persuasive story alleviate consumers' unfavorable response <b>to</b> <b>imitated</b> CSR initiative? These questions were addressed with a 2 x 2 factorial design experiment where the dimensions were known brand/unknown brand and persuasive story/ no persuasive story. The persuasive story yielded significant main effects on product attitude and purchase intentions. However, simple effects analysis revealed that it was persuasive story alongside the known brand that provided the significant results. The implication for managers is that persuasive story with a strong brand can jointly bring forth more favorably consumer response <b>to</b> <b>imitated</b> CSR-products. Interestingly, the present study found significant correlation between perceived sincerity of the company and perceived fit (between CSR initiative and the company), recognizing that this correlation may not necessarily mean causation, future studies may consider investigation of the causal analysis between the two variables. nhhma...|$|R

5|$|Chronophotograpic {{studies of}} animals in motion, created by {{scientist}} Étienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts—perhaps in an effort <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> these mechanical images.

The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E

Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV).
