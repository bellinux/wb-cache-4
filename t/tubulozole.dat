50|$|Erbulozole (R55104) is a {{congener}} of the microtubule inhibitor <b>tubulozole.</b> It {{is undergoing}} phase I clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic agent.|$|E
40|$|The mode {{of action}} of the <b>tubulozole</b> isomers, {{recently}} recognized as {{a new class of}} potential antimalarial agents, was investigated. Whereas neither glycolysis, protease activity, or nucleic acid biosynthesis was primarily affected, protein biosynthesis decreased soon after addition of the drug. Inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, however, did not show synergistic activity with <b>tubulozole.</b> Colcemid, on the other hand, had an effect on protein synthesis similar to that seen with the tubulozoles. Furthermore, combinations of the <b>tubulozole</b> isomers with compounds known to interact with tubulin inhibited malaria in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. Therefore, the inhibition might be elicited by interaction with tubulin or some other component of the microtubules. This is remarkable insofar as only one of the <b>tubulozole</b> isomers affects mammalian cells by binding to tubulin...|$|E
40|$|Microtubules and microfilaments were {{localized}} by an immunocytochemical {{method in}} the granular {{cells of the}} frog bladder after fixation and isolation. An extensive array of microtubules was observed in the granular cells with an orientation towards the luminal plasma membrane in the supranuclear zone. Actin filaments formed a continuous bundle that underlined the cellular membrane. After incubation {{in the presence of}} colchicine, nocodazole, or <b>tubulozole,</b> the microtubular network appeared fragmented but did not disappear completely. These observations are related {{to the role of the}} cytoskeleton in the permeability response of the frog bladder epithelium to vasopressin...|$|E
