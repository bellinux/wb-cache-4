Two problems are considered: stabilization using ``nonlinear wrappers'' to rescale a given control law and real-time <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> <b>using</b> differential flatness. For both problems, simplified versions of the general problem are studied using tools from differential geometry and nonlinear control to give insights into the limitations imposed by magnitude and rate limits and provide insights into constructive solutions to the trajectory generation and tracking problems...|$|R

Consideration of vehicle rotation is shown to be necessary if the trajectory is to avoid obstacles specified in a fixed Earth axis system. The paper establishes that, {{despite the presence of}} significant non-linearities, it is possible to articulate the obstacle avoidance problem in a tractable convex form using multiple optimization passes. Finally, it is shown by simulation that an optimal trajectory that accounts for the vehicle’s changing velocity throughout the manoeuvre is superior to a previous analytical method that assumes constant speed...|$|R

Various methods for the trajectory generation {{have been proposed}} so far, but robots must deal with environments including human operators.

40|$|Abstract — Determining safe {{aircraft}} trajectories that avoid hazardous weather {{regions and}} other aircraft while efficiently using the available airspace {{is an important}} problem. Although tactical weather forecast maps have been available, their use in automated aircraft trajectory generation has not been fully explored or implemented. We consider aircraft <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> <b>using</b> forecast data available from the Corridor Integrated Weather System product. The forecasts, updated at regular intervals, are used to design no-fly regions. We propose a receding horizon trajectory generation based on the dynamic nature of the forecast. Our method uses current environment information and incrementally updated forecast to update and optimize the trajectories. Simulations are shown based on forecast weather and indicate the advantage of taking into account time-varying forecasts in the planning horizon. I...|$|R

In this paper a 15 degrees of Freedom dynamic model of a compliant humanoid robot is used, combined with reinforcement learning to perform global search in the parameter space to produce stable gaits. It is shown that for a given speed, multiple sets of parameters, namely step sizes and lateral sways, are obtained by the learning algorithm which can lead to stable walking. The resulting set of gaits can be further studied in terms of parameter sensitivity and also to include additional optimization criteria to narrow down the chosen walking trajectories for the humanoid robot...|$|R

It is based on extending the active stiffness controller to the 7 DOF case in general and use of an efficient version of the gradient projection technique for solving the inverse kinematics problem. Cooperative control is achieved through appropriate configuration of individual manipulator controllers. In addition, other aspects of <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> <b>using</b> standard techniques are integrated into the controller. The method is then applied to a specific manipulator of interest (Robotics Research T- 710). Simulation of the kinematics, dynamics, and control are provided {{in the context of}} several scenarios: one pertaining to a noncontact pick and place operation; one relating to contour following where contact is made between the manipulator and environment; and one pertaining to cooperative control...|$|R

The aim of this system {{is to help the}} operator to guide the machine in order to give more attention to the order task. To reach this goal, we use a visual perception of the environment because this sensor gives a solution well adapted to lots of situations. This project began with researches on a visual guidance system for a lawn mower in 1990 and has been adaptated {{to the development of the}} same system for a combine harvester in 1995. We model the lawn mower with a virtual axle, <b>use</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> to guide it, and localize the vehicle at each iteration to insure the servoing task.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} system safety {{assurance}} is {{the application of}} large test sets. To aid {{in the development of}} test cases, researchers have investigated automated test generation systems which decrease the time and cost of acquiring new tests. Many automated systems currently exist, but few address the generation of trajectories of data. A trajectory is defined as a series of data points with each point relying upon the state of the system and previous point values. Examples of trajectories include an airplane’s flight path or data describing a nuclear reaction. This paper describes an original approach to test <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> <b>using</b> statistical regression models. An existing small set of trajectories is utilized to build regressive models. Then, the independent variables of the model can be perturbed, providing the basis {{for the use of the}} regressive model in the generation of new trajectories. A case study has been conducted within the scope of testing the sensor failure detection, identification, and accommodation (SFDIA) flight control scheme. We report and evaluate the results of this case study. 1...|$|R
40|$|Servo {{actuators}} {{are integrated}} mechatronic drives for applications with high demands in dynamic re-sponse and positioning accuracy. In robotic applications, servo actuators are applied for fast and precise positioning of joint axes, manipulators or senors. The drives {{have to be}} able to move to the desired positions without any overshoot and need to provide high stead-state accuracy despite fast changes in load torque and disturbances. In the course of this thesis, improved electronics and advanced control for the widely used RX- 28 and RX- 64 servo actuators of the Dynamixel series produced by Robotis were developed and evaluated. The enhanced electronic setup improves the operating characteristics and eliminates design-related deficien-cies of the original servo actuators. The essential improvements comprise increased measurement accu-racy, computational capability and power efficiency. The advanced control concept introduces a tracking control with a highly adjustable desired trajectory for an individual control of the angular position and speed. The <b>used</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> allows to customize the desired actuator motion and the applied state observer provides an accurate estimation of relevant actuator values.

40|$|International audienceThe {{process of}} {{conducting}} a mission for an autonomous aircraft includes determining {{the set of}} waypoints (flight planning) and the path for the aircraft to fly (path planning). The autonomous aircraft is an under-actuated system, having less control inputs than degrees of freedom and has two nonholonomic (non integrable) kinematic constraints. Consequently, the set of feasible trajectories will be restricted {{and the problem of}} trajectory generation becomes more complicated than a simple interpolation. Care must be taken in the selection of the basic primitives to respect the kinematic and dynamic limitations. The topic of this paper is <b>trajectory</b> <b>generation</b> <b>using</b> parametric curves. The problem can be formulated as follows: to lead the autonomous aircraft from an initial configuration qi to a final configuration qf in the absence of obstacles, find a trajectory q(t) for 0 ≤t ≤ T. The trajectory can be broken down into a geometric path q(s), s being the curvilinear abscissa and s=s(t) a temporal function. In 2 D the curves fall into two categories: * Curves whose coordinates have a closed form expressions, for example B-splines, quintic polynomials or polar splines. * Curves whose curvature is a function of their arc length for example clothoids, cubic spirals, quintic or intrinsic splines. Some 3 D solutions will be presented in this paper and their effectiveness discussed towards the problem in hand...|$|R
