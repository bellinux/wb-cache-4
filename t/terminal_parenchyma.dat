40|$|The {{value of}} growth rings as proxy data for climate {{reconstruction}} was studied in two miombo woodland species in eastern Africa. Growth rings, marked by <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> were visually detectable on carefully prepared stem discs of Isoberlinia tomentosa and Brachystegia spiciformis, dominant {{species of the}} miombo woodland in north-western Tanzania. However, the presence of multiple growth ring anomalies rendered cross-dating of the growth ring series between trees difficult. Cross-dating succeeded for eight out of thirteen samples for Isoberlinia tomentosa, but was unsuccessful for Brachystegia spiciformis. A mean series of 38 years was calculated for Isoberlinia tomentosa only. Monthly precipitation, monthly maximum air temperature and monthly SOI-value (Southern Oscillation Index) correlated significantly with tree ring widths of the mean series. These correlations are strong indicators of the annual character of the growth rings. They also suggest that Isoberlinia tomentosa provides an appropriate paleoclimatic record for dendroclimatic reconstruction. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cordia alliodora has a high {{ecological}} and economical {{value in the}} dry forest of Colombia. We documented the relationship between tree growth and climate variables (total annual precipitation, mean annual temperature) and the southern oscillation index (SOI) in this study. Standard dendrochronological methods were applied on 28 individuals. Presence of annual growth rings weas defined by semicircular porosity and <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> The tree-ring chronology spanned over the period 1944 - 2013 (70 years). Gompertz model was the mathematical function that best represented the growth. Radial growth was positively influenced by total annual precipitation and negatively related to mean annual temperature. There was no relation between tree growth and the SOI index (indicator of El Niño/La Niña events). A spectral density analysis of the residual tree-ring chronology showed a periodicity of 3. 3 years cycle, similar to those cycles recorded on the precipitation and temperature series. According to the results, C. alliodora diameter growth would peak 205. 5 cm at 65 years old...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} wood {{from the trunk}} of the studied linden showed a {{periodic}} change in the orientation of the grain, occurring in an approximately two-year cycle. These changes in the grain were accompanied by cyclic changes in the configuration of events in the rays, that is, in the splitting and uniting of rays in the cambium. Intrusive growth on the lateral, radial edges near the ends of fusiform cells caused the translocation of cells on the storey borders, resulting in the splitting and uniting of rays. The growth activity of fusiform cells was determined on the basis of analysis of events in the rays through comparison of successive layers of the <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> of the wood. Grouping of the ends of intrusively growing cells occurred here. The distribution of growth activity {{on the surface of the}} cambium was not uniform. It was possible to identify areas of cambium significantly differing from each other in respect to the duration of their growth activity. This period did not coincide with the duration of the cycle of changes in the configuration of events...|$|E
40|$|Storied pattern, in the {{arrangement}} of both fusiform initials and the rays in cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides, develops in ontogeny relatively quickly and becomes clearly visible in <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> of third and fourth annual ring. At first, anticlinal longitudinal divisions and restricted intrusive growth of fusiform initials lead {{to the formation of}} their characteristic horizontal tiers. Then, initiation of secondary rays, taking place rather within such tiers, not between them, makes possible the formation of storied ray pattern. New secondary rays originate most frequently from fusiform initials by their segmentation. This makes the appearance of ray tiers rather quick. However, the high order in the structure of cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides is also due to another, very curious and not known until now mechanism. It operates through limited in its range, thus highly controlled, vertical migration of rays on the cambial surface. This applies to asymmetrically positioned rays either primary, which are often originally sited "out of order" or secondary, initiated off-centre within the existing tiers. Excessively asymmetric rays, lying accidentally on the border between two neighbouring storeys, often undergo splitting and then the derivative rays move toward the centres of the storeys. Ray displacement is due to elimination of one or two of ray initial cells on one edge of the ray and simultaneous, multiple divisions adding new ray cells on the opposite edge...|$|E
40|$|The study uses {{a rather}} unusual method, dendrochronology, to {{investigate}} the growth and survival of Atriplex portulacoides L. and Artemisia maritima L. on salt marshes at two field sites on the Dutch North Sea barrier islands of Terschelling and Ameland. By providing information on longevity of these typical salt-marsh shrubs, dendrochronology offers an indirect way {{to investigate the}} influence of management regime – grazing in this case – on marsh quality and areal extent. Diminishment of salt marshes is a continuing concern in the northern Netherlands. The two shrub species studied here, A. portulacoides and A. maritima, are common to salt marshes. With their extensive roots and branches, they facilitate sedimentation and stabilize salt marshes. Using dendrochronology, this study found that annual growth rings could be identified to determine shrub age and growth. In A. portulacoides these rings {{took the form of}} a narrow band of <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> In A. maritima they were made up of unlignified marginal parenchyma together with higher vessel density {{at the beginning of the}} growing season. Growth rings indicated that intense grazing was clearly detrimental to the survival of A. portulacoides at the Terschelling site. However, grazing facilitated survival of A. maritima at the Ameland site by reducing light and nutrient competition from grasses. No growth trends could be found, however, as the lifespan for both species is short and many other influences on shrub growth could be identified...|$|E
40|$|The cambium and 9 annual growths from a linden stem were studied. Some of the {{fusiform}} cell ends {{changed their}} contacts-which {{is shown by}} the comparison of the cambium layer and <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> of the phloem. This means that these ends were active in the period the layers under comparison were formed. The active ends were found in groups numbering a few to ten-odd ends alternating with groups of inactive ends. About 70 % of the ends retained their activity for only one year. In the studied areas. in a given year, one direction of migration of the active ends dominated. As a rule, this configuration changed every two years. Along with {{the change in the}} configuration of the active ends, the position of the active areas also changed {{in such a way that}} after the change of configuration, the areas previously inactive became active. No migration of activity along the borders of the storeys was observed, but only its appearance and disappearance, which was called fibrillation of activity. Fibrillation of activity becomes noticeable when there is a low intensity of events. Because the active areas at a given moment are characterized by one type of configuration of events, the whole studied surface can be seen as a single domain. Fibrillation gives the impression of frequent changes of domain type, these changes, however, are of a different nature than the movement of domain borders found in cambium characterized by a high intensity of events...|$|E
40|$|Vascular wilts {{caused by}} xylem-colonizing {{pathogens}} {{are among the}} most devastating plant diseases that affect a wide range of plant species worldwide. Information on the distribution of V. dahliae in infected trees helps to design an appropriate and efficient sampling method for reliable detection of the pathogen in diseased trees. In Chapter 3, the distribution of V. dahliae in young twigs and leaves of infected olive trees is studied by real-time quantification of V. dahliae DNA. Analysis of twig and leaf samples collected from different sides of the crown of infected olive trees showed a non-uniform distribution of the fungus within infected parts of diseased olive trees. It was demonstrated that testing of combined samples comprising subsamples from at least 5 twigs from different sides of the tree, or 5 - 10 random leaves, can reliably detect the pathogen. V. dahliae isolates that infect olive trees can be classified as defoliating (D) isolates that are highly virulent, or non-defoliating (ND) isolates that are generally less aggressive. Discrimination of these pathotypes is important in order to predict the severity of disease, and decide on appropriate disease management strategies. This is particularly important due to the alarming spread of highly virulent isolates of the D pathotype worldwide. In Chapter 4, a novel method is designed for accurate discrimination and sensitive detection of D and ND isolates of V. dahliae. Through comparative genomics of multiple D and ND isolates of V. dahliae a region was identified that is present in all sequenced ND isolates, while absent from all D isolates. Based on this presence-absence polymorphism, a set of primers was designed spanning this region that was able to generate differentially sized amplicons for isolates that belong to the different pathotypes. Additionally, a nested-PCR assay was designed to increase the sensitivity and improve detection of D and ND isolates in planta. In Chapter 5, the relation of the dynamics in pathogen distribution in infected plants to the differences in extent and severity of disease caused by D and ND isolates in resistant and susceptible olive genotypes is studied. To this end, the distribution of a D (V 117) and a ND (V 4) isolate of V. dahliae in root-inoculated young plants of a susceptible (Picual) and a partially resistant cultivar (Frantoio) of olive and its relationship to the disease progression was investigated using real-time PCR. The amount of pathogen DNA detected in the two cultivars correlated with their susceptibility to Verticillium wilt, with lower quantities of V 4 and V 117 DNA detected in ‘Frantoio’ than in ‘Picual’. Also quantities of pathogen DNA in V 117 -inoculated plants were higher than quantities of pathogen DNA in V 4 -inoculated plants. The distribution patterns of D and ND isolates in the lower, middle and top parts of tested olive cultivars showed that differences in symptom severity were related to amounts of the pathogen in lower and middle parts of the trees, since colonization of the pathogen in top parts of the stem of inoculated plants was minor and was not significantly different between treatments. Moreover, microscopic analysis of infection and colonization processes of V. dahliae in olive plants inoculated with GFP-labelled isolates revealed that colonization of the above ground tissues of infected olive plants is by means of conidia transported upward with the xylem sap stream. In Chapter 6 we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of V. dahliae in relation to disease progression and recovery in stem-inoculated maple and ash trees. These species differ strongly in vascular anatomy with maple having a diffuse porous xylem anatomy whereas ash has a ring porous xylem anatomy. Results showed that that differences in the xylem anatomy of ash and maple did not significantly affect the speed and extent of the upward spread of the pathogen in stem-inoculated trees. Nevertheless, the xylem of ash trees is much less supportive for growth and survival of V. dahliae than that of maple trees, as in the year after inoculation disease incidence and also quantities of V. dahliae detected in maple trees were significantly higher than in ash trees. Moreover, V. dahliae could not be reisolated at all from ash trees that had recovered from disease. However, it could be detected by PCR in some cases in the xylem formed in the year of inoculation, never in the xylem formed in the year after inoculation. Nevertheless, V. dahliae easily could be detected in the wood of diseased ash and maple trees in the year after inoculation. Notably, despite the presence of a layer of <b>terminal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells between growth rings, in ash trees showing disease symptoms in the year after inoculation V. dahliae was present in the xylem of the new growth ring. It was also observed that in stem-inoculated trees V. dahliae can move downward from the point of inoculation into the root collar, which may provide an avenue for infection of new growth rings in ash trees...|$|E
