5|$|For {{much of the}} 1770s, the Comanche had raided in New Mexico.

30|$|The {{results of}} surveys {{conducted}} even during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> differ significantly because of sample structures, {{as well as}} the somewhat vague definition of “intersectoral mobility”, which may vary, for example, from any job change or to a part-time employment of university professors by industry.|$|R

5|$|Giselle made 6500 francs between June and September 1841. This {{was twice}} the amount for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> in 1839. Grisi's salary was {{increased}} {{to make her}} the top earner among the dancers at the Opéra. Souvenirs were sold, pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act II costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called façonné Giselle, and Madame Lainné, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends. The first five chapters cover <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E

In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> is more pronounced in color than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on Lavaca River in Jackson County. Five decades later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, the artifacts were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. She determined that while most of the artifacts were Spanish, some definitively matched artifacts recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan. Details of several confiscations from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan {{have been reported}} by the IPPL, including one event on 2May 2007, where 40slow lorises were confiscated at Narita Airport only {{a month before the}} CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of those animals died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking a ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
