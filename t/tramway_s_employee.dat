The authors argue that customer-employee interactions have distinct characteristics from organizational insider interactions, and provide two studies to compare the frequency and strain of verbal abuse from customers, supervisors and coworkers. Furthermore, they assess whether customer verbal abuse is only a critical issue for employees in jobs requiring emotional labor, measured with both O*NET job codes and self-reported display rules. With a national random sample of U. <b>S.</b> <b>employees</b> (n 2446) and {{a convenience sample of}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>employees</b> who have customer contact (n 121), the authors find that verbal abuse from outsiders (1) occurs more frequently than insider verbal abuse, particularly for those with higher emotional labor requirements, and (2) predicts emotional exhaustion over and above insider verbal abuse, regardless of emotional labor requirements.

Respondents rated both agents and principals most favorably when the agent adopted a forthcoming delivery style while delivering bad news. However, when the agent accepted personal responsibility for a bad news outcome, respondents formed separate evaluations for the principal and the agent, leading to a potential conflict of interest between agent and principal. Specifically, respondents 2 ̆ 7 evaluations for the principal were most favorable when the agent passed off responsibility for the problem to the client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>employee</b> rather than accepting personal responsibility. However, the agent derived the highest evaluations by personally accepting responsibility for bad news.

That is, in conditions in which respondents perceived they would be expected to later justify their evaluations, both the principal and agent received the highest evaluations when the agent passed responsibility for the bad news to the client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>employee.</b> This suggests that accountability moderates an individual 2 ̆ 7 s evaluative responses and in so doing, eliminates the principal-agent conflict. ...|$|R

This study discloses many differences and similarities in job preferences between Chinese overseas graduates and domestic graduates. Foreign educated graduates were more interested in job-related factors, such as "advancement" and "type of work"; whereas Chinese domestic graduates thought "benefits" and "work conditions" were important. "Pay" was considered as the most important attribute by both parties. The pattern of preferences in current young Chinese employees was distinct from U. <b>S.</b> <b>employees,</b> {{but not as much as}} before. Because both Chinese and U. <b>S.</b> <b>employees</b> emphasised on "advancement" and "type of work". The preferences in current young Chinese employees also changed a lot comparing with the past.

Generally, MSAs in Chinese applied cash-based compensation, contracts, promotion and training opportunities, and good work conditions to retain talented Chinese <b>employees.</b> Like U. <b>S.</b> employers who often misconstrue the preferences of their employees, Chinese employers also misreported their employees' preferences, so there were no visible strategy differences in retaining foreign educated employees and local employees.

This dissertation is a mixed-methods study that adapted and applied a theory from sociology, namely Erving Goffman 2 ̆ 7 s frame analysis to study Daimler 2 ̆ 7 s online communication and to examine the extent to which Daimler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>employees</b> identify themselves with the company, a concept that I call corporate identity convergence (CIC). The CIC was measured by assessing how Daimler 2 ̆ 7 s core values such as innovation, sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and diversity were framed in the employees 2 ̆ 7 online communication. A total of 227 blog posts written in German by Daimler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>employees</b> between 2010 and 2012 were analyzed using the grounded theory methodology and the simultaneous multiple regression analysis.

Based on the results, this dissertation provides a coding protocol that theorists and practitioners can use to assess CIC as well as practical advice on how companies can boost their identity convergence with various stakeholder groups with the ultimate purpose of building trustful relationships and bringing about positive changes in the environments in which companies operate. Finally, the coding protocol can be applied not only to public relations but also to other areas of study such as government and media relations. ...|$|R

This exploratory and descriptive study was based on quantitative approach and had used data collection instruments consisting of a Job Satisfaction (JS) Scale and a Distributive Justice (DJ) Perception, both validated by Siqueira (2008) that were in addition to a questionnaire to survey the profile of participants. The sample was intentional non-probabilistic and was chosen according to the accessibility, location and adequacy of the hotels to the study 2 ̆ 7 s objectives. The study was conducted with ninety two participants working in seven hotels. Data were compiled and analyzed with descriptive statistics and inferential tests using SPSS 20.
