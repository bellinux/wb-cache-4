5|$|At the 2009 National Championships, Tarwater {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States team in the World Championships {{for the third time}} in his career by placing sixth in the 200-meter freestyle. He also placed fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, and fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. In the preliminary round of the 4×200-meter freestyle, he helped the United States <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top qualifying time. The United States later won the event, earning Tarwater a gold medal. After the 2009 season, Tarwater decided to retire from competitive swimming and concentrate on his academic work at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|NY9M {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY8 (now CR53) {{north of the}} hamlet of Starbuckville {{in the town of}} Horicon. The route followed Valentine Pond Road north for a negligible distance, then progressed westward along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road. Across the river, Carl Turner Road, a locally maintained highway, followed a routing parallel to that of NY9M on the other shore. Both roads gradually curved northward, mirroring a similar <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river's course. Carl Turner Road came to an end here; however, NY9M continued on. Near a junction with modern-day Short Street, NY9M began to deviate from the river.|$|E

40|$|Theabilities of four {{species of}} diurnal jumping spiders (Helpis minitabunda,Portia fimbriata, Trite auricoma, and Trite planiceps) and one species of nocturnal clubionid spider (Clubiona cambridgei) to {{maintain}} approximately straight paths by alternating <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of visual cues was investigated. Under infra-red light (observed using infra-red video), individual spiders were run rough a maze comprising a single forced turn {{and then a}} choice of <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same or opposite direction to the forced turn. At the second (free) <b>turn,</b> each species <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction opposite to the forced turn (i. e., alternated turns) more frequently than it <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction. There was no evidence that species differed in tendency to alternate <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> nature, jumping spiders may use this ability to navigate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of visual cues when foraging or escaping predators in darkness. It is suggested that alternation of turns by jumping spiders depends on proprioceptive information gathered during previous turns...|$|R
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the sharp <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E
5|$|Tiger sharks {{have a large}} upper lobe, {{which allows}} for slow {{cruising}} and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark {{must be able to}} twist and <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the bridge}} and exit18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward course through Queensbury quickly brings it to the {{outskirts}} of Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another swath of residential neighborhoods. Exits18 and19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY254 near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is Aviation Mall, located on NY254 just west of the route's junction with US9. A northwestern <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit20 and NY149. Past exit20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY9N via exits21 and22.|$|E
30|$|The {{participant}} {{was instructed to}} expand the hybrid MARME by 1  mm/day for 7  days (2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and 2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening). One week later, all participants presented for expansion assessment; if satisfactory, the {{participant was}} then instructed to constrict the maxilla by unwinding the hybrid MARME by 1  mm/day (2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and 2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening) for 7  days. This cycle was repeated until week 9. After 9  weeks of alternating expansion and contraction, the mobility of the maxilla was subjectively and manually assessed. This was done by supporting the forehead and bridge of the participant’s nose {{with one hand and}} holding the maxillary incisors with the other. The maxilla was then moved in an anterior and posterior direction to detect the mobility of the maxilla. When sufficient mobility “disarticulation” was achieved, the second phase (the protraction phase) of treatment commenced.|$|R

5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Five weeks later, Oxbow {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, Oxbow was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first <b>turn.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> stretch, Oxbow took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a blanket finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Hermione {{continue}} the quest, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including {{the death of}} Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, but she {{turns out to be}} Nagini in disguise, awaiting their arrival. The snake attacks Harry and again they barely escape, but Harry's wand is destroyed. Their luck finally appears to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest of Dean. A mysterious silver doe Patronus appears and guides Harry to an icy pond containing the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. During Harry's attempt to recover the sword, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. He is saved by Ron, who was guided back by the Deluminator, and they realise Dumbledore's gifts may be meaningful. Ron takes the sword and uses it to destroy the locket.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|PA371 {{continues}} eastward {{through the}} rural regions, continuing {{its way through}} Mount Pleasant Township. The highway intersects with Township Road 613, where the highway makes a hairpin turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route continues for a distance to the east until an intersection with Lebanon Township Road 614 {{in the community of}} Cold Spring. In Cold Spring, PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA371 continues through rural farmlands until a hairpin <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep forests nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} of Grodno proved disastrous to the allies {{who did not}} manage to attain any of their goals, while the Swedish army reached almost all of theirs; Stanisław Leszczyński was crowned king of Poland, the Saxon and Russian armies in Poland were beaten, and peace was forced upon Augustus who renounced all his claims to the Polish throne. The two traitors and principal designers of the campaign, Johann Patkul and Otto Arnold von Paykull were also taken prisoner by the Swedes and executed in 1707. However, the Great Northern War was far from being won. Charles reorganized his forces to march against his last remaining opponent, Peter the Great and the Tsardom of Russia. The Swedish invasion of Russia began in 1707 and ended with the disastrous Swedish defeat at Poltava. This marked a decisive <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war with Saxony and Denmark rejoining the alliance.|$|E

In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production.
