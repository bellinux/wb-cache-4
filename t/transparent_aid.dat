40|$|Decades-long {{debates over}} the quality, {{quantity}} and purpose of development aid {{have led to a}} renewed emphasis on whether, and under what circumstances, aid is effective in achieving development outcomes. There is significant policy consensus that aid is most effective in environments with “good” governance, which the United Nations defines as processes of decision making and implementation that are effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive, and accountable and <b>transparent.</b> <b>Aid</b> donors fund numerous projects aimed at strengthening good governance in recipient countries, often through reforms of political institutions. Yet many aid donors fail to theorize about the process or mechanism through which good governance aid drives institutional change, and in doing so often ignore the impact that other drivers of change may have on the implicitly assumed direct causal relationship between aid and improved governance in political institutions. This thesis explores the role of aid in shifting institutions toward the ideal of good governance through an analysis that embeds this aid within a larger context that takes into account the role of other drivers of change. It compares good governance-related changes within Peru’s judicial institutions and Comptroller (Auditor) General over a 30 -year period, from 1980 - 2010, examining the main actors and factors that drove or influenced changes in institutional accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, asking how they drove these changes and overcame resistance to reforms. Building upon this within-case analysis, this thesis then compares across cases to develop conclusions about the necessary and sufficient conditions that resulted in positive good governance-related changes. It concludes with a discussion of the opportunities for, and limitations of, good governance aid as a driver of change in political institutions...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{science is}} a fairly new {{multidisciplinary}} field that integrates performance domains such as sports, medicine, business, and the arts. To give its many branches a structure and its research a direction, it requires a theoretical framework. We demonstrate the applications of this framework with examples from sport and medicine. Because performance science deals mainly with situations of uncertainty rather than known risks, the needed framework can be provided by the fast-and-frugal heuristics approach. According to this approach, experts learn to rely on heuristics in an adaptive way {{in order to make}} accurate decisions. We investigate the adaptive use of heuristics in three ways: the descriptive study of the heuristics in the cognitive "adaptive toolbox;" the prescriptive study of their "ecological rationality," that is, the characterization of the situations in which a given heuristic works; and the engineering study of "intuitive design," that is, the design of <b>transparent</b> <b>aids</b> for making better decisions...|$|R

We used 3 D modeling programs to design 3 D models of a tissue-handling system and these models were "printed" in a stereolithography (SLA) 3 D printer to create precision histology devices that are particularly useful to handle multiple samples with small dimensions in parallel. Our {{system has been}} successfully tested for in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos. Some of the notable features include: (1) A conveniently transferrable chamber with 6 mesh-bottomed wells, each of which can hold dozens of zebrafish embryos. This design allows up to 6 different samples to be treated per chamber. (2) Each chamber sits in a well of a standard 6 -well tissue culture plate. Thus, up to 36 different samples can be processed in tandem using a single 6 well plate. (3) Precisely fitting lids prevent solution evaporation and condensation, even at high temperatures {{for an extended period}} of time: i. e., overnight riboprobe hybridization. (4) Flat bottom mesh maximizes the consistent treatment of individual tissue samples. (5) A magnet-based lifter was created to handle up to 6 chambers (= 36 samples) in unison.

Methods Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) relative to usual care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared with analysis on the cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for comparing strategies across potential threshold values for multiple outcomes include: expected net loss (ENL) planes quantifying differences in expected net benefit; the ENL contour identifying preferred strategies minimising ENL and their expected value of perfect information; and cost-effectiveness acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising ENL.

All lists {{so far have been}} based on expert opinion and primarily aimed at representativeness of the taxonomic and habitat diversity rather than at quantifying the harm the alien species cause. We used the generic impact scoring system (GISS) to rank 486 alien species established in Europe {{from a wide range of}} taxonomic groups to identify those with the highest environmental and socioeconomic impact. GISS assigns 12 categories of impact, each quantified on a scale from 0 (no impact detectable) to 5 (the highest impact possible). We ranked species by their total sum of scores and by the number of the highest impact scores. We also compared the listing based on GISS with other expert-based lists of the ‘‘worst’’ invaders. We propose a list of 149 alien species, comprising 54 plants, 49 invertebrates, 40 vertebrates and 6 fungi. Among the highest ranking species are one bird (Branta canadensis), four mammals (Rattus norvegicus, Ondatra zibethicus, Cervus nippon, Muntiacus reevesi), one crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), one mite(Varroa destructor), and four plants (Acacia dealbata, Lantana camara, Pueraria lobata, Eichhornia crassipes).

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} combined {{economic and environmental}} assessment tool for evaluating the economic and environmental performance of alternative maintenance strategies for optimising service life extension of old railway bridges. It is intended to assist bridge managers in identifying the best overall combination of both economic and environmental criteria in their decision making. An approach to assess the potential environmental effect of delaying maintenance work into the future, through the introduction of time-weighting of environmental impacts, is proposed. It is intended to aid railway asset managers to determine the potential benefit or dis-benefit of such ‘delaying’ options, in comparison with ‘non-delaying’ options. The methodology of the tool is based on life cycle analysis and accounts for the cost and environmental impacts that arise during the working life of different alternative maintenance strategies. The economic performance of the alternatives is analysed by using Life Cycle Costing (LCC) whilst the environmental performance is assessed based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The tool addresses the potential unequal working lives of alternative maintenance strategies by evaluating cost and environmental performance through an ‘equivalent annual’ term. The combined economic and environmental performance of the alternatives is evaluated through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique called ‘Single Multi-Attribute Rating Technique using Swings’ (SMARTS). A case study based on typical maintenance plans for a U. K. railway bridge is presented to demonstrate {{the application of the}} developed methodology. The three alternative maintenance strategies assessed are deck replacement, standard deck restoration and minor deck restoration. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to account for limited knowledge in some of the input quantities. In summary, this research has shown that the developed combined economic and environmental assessment tool has the ability to identify the best overall performance bridge maintenance alternative and is capable of integrating economic and environmental inputs and presenting the overall performance output in a coherent and <b>transparent</b> way to <b>aid</b> towards decision making. It is believed that it can be of particular use in asset integrity management decisions for assets approaching the end of their original or design service life...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{compounds}} {{are some}} of the most toxic compounds of any heavy metal on earth. Due to long-range transport from point sources Hg can be found world-wide in air, soil, water, and living organisms. Mercury compounds can cause a number of adverse effects, with the unborn fetus, infants, and children being most susceptible. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an excellent vertebrate model system for toxicological studies, including developmental effects. The overall objective of this research was to investigate the effects of inorganic forms of Hg in zebrafish larvae. Unique accumulation patterns were observed using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging after zebrafish were exposed to one of four Hg compounds (i. e. mercuric chloride, mercury bis-L-cysteineate, methylmercury chloride, methylmercury L-cysteineate). Specifically, we noted chemical form dependant and tissue-specific Hg accumulation including the sensory cells of the olfactory epithelia and the neuromasts. Phenylthiourea (PTU) is commonly used to block zebrafish melanogenesis to generate <b>transparent</b> larvae to <b>aid</b> with enhanced visualization of immunohistochemical and vital stains. It was determined that PTU dramatically alters Hg toxicity through chemical interaction with Hg so that further studies were conducted in the absence of PTU. To investigate the effects of Hg on primary neurons, the immunohistochemistry protocol using anti-acetylated tubulin was performed and the results demonstrated that mercuric chloride damages primary neurons particularly in the olfactory pits. To study potential detoxification of Hg in zebrafish we examined the efficacy of two sequestration agents, dimercaptosuccinic acid and alpha lipoic acid, as well as endogenous selenium. The levels of Hg were not significantly lower following treatment with either sequestration agent under the conditions used in this research. Previous work examining the antagonistic relationship between Hg and selenium has been conducted by dosing animals with both Hg and selenium (Se). We discovered a mixed chalcogenide of the general form HgSxSe(1 -x) forming in vivo following exposure to mercuric chloride without the addition of selenium. Indeed the selenium may have been remobilized from natural stores in the pigment spots. The research presented herein demonstrates that the target tissues for Hg depend strongly on chemical form. In particular inorganic Hg can accumulate in a number of important tissues including sensory systems. The formation of insoluble and non-toxic HgSxSe(1 -x) in zebrafish larvae suggests that endogenous selenium may play critical roles in modulating toxicity...|$|R
40|$|From 2000 until 2010, the People’s Republic of China {{has taken}} on a much more {{significant}} role in the international arena. Its steadily growing economic and political involvement in Asia, Africa and Latin America is associated with its rise as a new world power with the potential to challenge the global leadership role of the remaining superpower, the United States. The People’s Republic is also continually expanding its influence in the South Pacific region. Although it has diplomatic relations with only seven of the 13 independent South Pacific island states, after 200 years of Western domination there is now already talk of an unfolding paradigm shift within the region. In less than 10 years China’s trade with the South Pacific States has increased tenfold to US$ 1. 4 billion (2007). Whereas Western states have reduced or even completely closed down their embassies, staff and developmental cooperation in the region {{since the end of the}} Cold War, Peking has constantly expanded its diplomatic presence and development cooperation. Security experts are warning about the long-term strategic intentions of the People’s Republic in the region. Many are asserting that the South Pacific has already been chosen by Peking as its strategic backyard. Others see the U. S. as already under challenge in the region as the unipolar hegemon today, and are proclaiming a new cold war. In fact, there is no doubt that the days are over where the South Pacific was solely under the influence of the West. The Chinese government has sagely and deftly turned the waning interest of European countries and the U. S. in the region, which reflects worldwide economic structural changes in the context of a changing international division of labor, to its advantage by deepening bilateral relations with its South Pacific partners. Although the motivation for Chinese involvement from the middle of the 1990 s initially focused on blocking further expansion of Taiwan and the solidarity of the States when issues were put to a vote in international organizations, over the past decade this has been augmented by the desire to secure supplies of raw materials and sales markets. These are necessary to maintain China’s rapid pace of economic growth. The competition between China and Taiwan for diplomatic recognition is taking on a destructive quality. The validity of the basic principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other States championed by mainland China, one of the “five principles of peaceful coexistence,” is not respected by Beijing itself, as shown by their cloaked interventions in the domestic policy of numerous island states. The influence of the two States (“check-book diplomacy”) corrupts internal political processes, devalues elections and reduces the legitimacy of people active in politics. All told, the competition between China and Taiwan for recognition destabilizes the only weakly institutionalized states and encourages endemic corruption. The substantially increased development cooperation by both Peking and Taiwan since 2006 has also met with criticism from established donor States and nongovernmental organizations. Because of its generosity and perceived freedom from conditions (“no strings attached”), it is warmly welcomed by these governments. That the cooperation is unconditional proves, however, to be deceptive, since development projects are linked to terms of delivery dictated by Beijing. Workers and materials come exclusively from China. Most of the work involves large-scale projects which benefit elite groups in urban centers. The support that is given not only lacks transparency, is inappropriate for local conditions and causes debt spending, but it also undermines longstanding efforts by previous donor countries to link development aid with responsible government. In Fiji it has also stabilized the military regime. Despite the increase in development aid from the two East Asian States, the contribution of the Western donor bloc to official development cooperation continues to be overwhelming. Thanks to the election of Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeous in May 2008 and the improved bilateral relations between Taipeh and Beijing, a partial change in a positive direction is becoming visible both on the issue of “check-book diplomacy” as well as with development cooperation. While the “truce” in their competition proclaimed by both sides offers Taiwan the chance to re-focus development cooperation on long term results and to intensify cooperation with international donors, Beijing continues to refuse to make its development <b>aid</b> <b>transparent</b> and to coordinate it with other donor countries. However, economic cooperation with Beijing may well present a major challenge for the island states. In only a few years China has evolved into a major player, but, especially in extraction of raw materials, is only one among many investors operating globally. Until now, Australia, Japan and the European Union have been able to maintain their strong sub-regional presence as trade partners of the island states. However, it is not just large Chinese corporations which are increasingly active in the South Pacific, but first and foremost illegal Chinese immigrants or immigrants of Chinese descent, too, who dominate not only the wholesale and retail trade but the service sector as well. Their strong presence is forcing local companies out of business, which leads to deep resentment and defensive reactions as borne out by the destruction of Chinese business districts in Tonga and the Solomon Islands in 2006 and the almost regularly incidence of Chinese business people being murdered in Papua New Guinea. The economic involvement of China, as well as other East Asian and Southeast Asian states, has suffered a significant loss of reputation in the region. The criticism is directed in particular at uncontrolled overfishing on a wide scale, predominantly illegal large-scale logging in the forestry sector and the use by Chinese firms of their own workers. This leads to the loss of jobs and denies locals any spin-off advantages even for low-level, menial jobs. It is obvious that economic cooperation with the island states has hardly led to the “win-win” situation promised by Beijing. This means that China’s acclaimed South- South model of cooperation (the “Beijing Consensus”) as an alternative to Western development concepts has no empirical basis. As with other economic players, self-interest stands in the foreground. The economic impetus stemming from the Asian continent and in this case especially from China will continue to be felt above all in the few States with mineral ore reserves. Currently, it is hardly possible to speak of “soft power” qualities of China comparable with those of the West. Because of its economic development path, its political ideals and its culture, the appeal of mainland China continues to be limited in the island states. For decades to come, the People’s Republic will possess even less the “hard power” for posit- II ing a realistic threat to the security architecture of the Pacific region or even to the military superiority of the U. S. To date, Beijing has no military bases in the region. For these reasons, China is far from being able to restructure the order of things in the region. There are also no known intentions on Beijing’s part of taking such a step. The “China threat” debate also fails to recognize the solidity of continuing relations with the former colonial powers. Even today, half of the 26 South Pacific States and territories are integrated into the Western metropolitan powers or enjoy associate status which guarantees them massive financial support. The current limited military capacity of the People’s Republic is also not taken into account. Regardless of this, a preventive military buildup by the US and Australia is already taking place in the Asia-Pacific region, which not only makes conflicts of interest with China inevitable in the middle term, but could also lead to an armaments spiral in the neighboring East Asian and Southeast Asian States. Pax Americana is still the indispensable framework for embedding the rise of China in the wider region. This means that Chinese-American relations remain vitally important. The rapprochement between Taipeh and Beijing, which has significantly defused the previous tensions over Taiwan, has marked out a path forward in constructive dialog. Potential conflicts can only be expected if the Chinese expectation of a stronger political leadership role in the region and the willingness of the US to make room for this cannot be brought into balance. This is true both regionally and globally. Während die westlichen Staaten in den letzten Jahren ihre Aktivitäten im südpazifischen Raum kontinuierlich verringert haben, hat China seine diplomatische Präsenz und die Entwicklungszusammenarbeit beständig erweitert. Roland Seib sucht zunächst nach den Gründen für dieses verstärkte Engagement und macht zwei maßgebliche Faktoren aus: Zum einen galt es, zumindest in früheren Jahren, eine weitere Ausdehnung Taiwans zu verhindern und sich der Solidarität insbesondere der Entwicklungsstaaten bei Abstimmungen in internationalen Organisationen zu versichern. Der andere Faktor ist wirtschaftlicher Natur. China nutzt die südpazifischen Staaten geschickt zur eigenen Versorgung mit Rohstoffen sowie zur Sicherung von Absatzmärkten. Roland Seib überprüft den Nutzen der chinesischen Entwicklungskooperation für die Staaten und benennt heikle Folgen. Anzeichen dafür, dass China in absehbarer Zeit zu einer Bedrohung für die Sicherheitsarchitektur des südpazifischen Raums werden könnte, findet der Autor allerdings nicht. Die China Threat-Debatte entbehrt, zumindest in dieser Region, jeder soliden Grundlage und lässt die präventive militärische Aufrüstung der USA und Australiens in dieser Region in fragwürdigem Licht erscheinen...|$|R
