2500|$|At 03:00 a British {{infantry}} {{advance in}} extended order began: [...] "Several shots rang out slightly <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> and then instantaneously {{the ground in}} front became alive with flashing rifles and machine guns, and hoarse shouts in guttural German and Turkish Arabic added to the increasing excitement." [...] Overrunning the first line of enemy trenches, [...] "orders now came to rally, and in a downpour of rain the first and second waves joined up and advanced {{in the face of a}} brisk fire from snipers and isolated enemy machine guns across the top of the redoubt. In the distance on all sides could be heard the shouts of the other attacking parties." ...|$|E
60|$|Comes a crash <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> and {{a running}} {{of people to}} see a cab-horse down on the slippery, {{slanting}} pavement outside St. Martin's Church.|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> rose {{the range}} of low, bleak {{mountains}} I had noted yesterday, and to our right sloped the mesquite-patched sweep of ridge and flat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your duty {{will now}} be <b>to</b> cover <b>our</b> <b>left</b> flank. I don't know whether you are aware that Wilson has moved forward, and will take post on the slopes near the Escurial. He has been {{directed}} to spread his force as much as possible, so as to give an appearance of greater strength than he has." ...|$|R
60|$|WYATT. Brett, {{when the}} Duke of Norfolk moved against us Thou cried'st 'A Wyatt!' and flying <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side <b>Left</b> his all bare, for which I love thee, Brett. Have for thine asking aught that I can give, For thro' thine help we are come to London Bridge; But how to cross it balks me. I fear we cannot.|$|R
60|$|And so {{for four}} long hours the battle raged almost without a pause, {{and at the}} end of that time, if we had gained nothing we had lost nothing. Two {{attempts}} <b>to</b> turn <b>our</b> <b>left</b> flank by forcing a way through the wood by which it was protected had been defeated; and as yet Nasta's swordsmen had, notwithstanding their desperate efforts, entirely failed to break Good's three squares, though they had thinned their numbers by quite a third.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our boat {{is doing}} {{about as well}} as any of them," [...] {{answered}} Larry, bound to defend himself. [...] "Two boats are aground <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> and three behind us." ...|$|E
60|$|Leaving Stonehaven we passed, on {{a rising}} ground a little <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> {{the house of}} the celebrated Barclay of Ury. It remains very much in its ancient condition, {{surrounded}} by a low stone wall, like the old fortified houses of Scotland.|$|E
60|$|We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary {{the hands}} prematurely, and after {{quite a long}} passage, landed {{at the mouth of}} the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. Surely {{the text}} refers <b>to</b> <b>our</b> right and <b>left</b> hands. I am {{somewhat}} {{surprised to hear}} a member of your Church quote so essentially Protestant a document as the Bible; {{but at least you}} might quote it accurately.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 68 -year {{old man was}} {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> department with <b>left</b> arm erythema, pain, and swelling after injecting insulin isophane. LRINEC score, CT, and MRI imaging diagnosed necrotizing fasciitis. With surgical debridement, tight glycemic control and treatment, the patient was discharged 13 days later...|$|R
5000|$|It was the {{location}} of an important clash between Berdan's Sharpshooters and Longstreet's corps as they were assembling prior to Pickett's charge. General Sickles described this in his oration after the battle, [...] "Col. Berdan pushing through the curtain of woods, hurled his dauntless little band directly against the force intended <b>to</b> crush in <b>our</b> <b>left</b> flank and seize the Round Tops;".|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, however, just as {{the issue}} hung doubtful, there was a shout <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> and looking, I made out the tall shape of Goroko, the witch-doctor, with the other Zulu, {{followed}} by his {{two hundred and fifty}} men, and leaping on to the flank of the line of Rezu.|$|E
60|$|We {{looked and}} looked. But {{we could not}} see <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> because of the bulge of rock. We climbed back. Then I {{saw one of the}} stags loping leisurely off to the left. Teague was calling. He said they had walked off the promontory, looking up, and {{stopping}} occasionally.|$|E
60|$|The charge, however, was {{successful}} and almost without loss, the enemy passing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10. Then {{turning to the}} right and left they captured the fort and the battery, with all the arms and troops in them. Continuing the charge, they also carried batteries Eleven and Twelve <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> which they turned toward City Point.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 6th Sheridan was sent to connect with Hancock's left and attack the enemy's cavalry who were trying <b>to</b> get on <b>our</b> <b>left</b> and rear. He met them at the {{intersection}} of the Furnace and Brock roads and at Todd's Tavern, and defeated them at both places. Later he was attacked, and again the enemy was repulsed.|$|R
6000|$|We all jumped <b>to</b> <b>our</b> feet. I <b>left</b> Jules {{and hurried}} after him. His face was grim, his eyes {{those of a}} {{creature}} who has been struck on a raw place. He made a movement of his fingers which said plainly. [...] "Leave me, if you please!" ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst {{this was}} going on General Meade was {{instructed}} to keep up an appearance of moving troops <b>to</b> <b>our</b> extreme <b>left.</b> Parke and Warren were kept with two divisions, each under arms, ready to move leaving their enclosed batteries manned, with a scattering line on the other intrenchments. The object of this was to prevent reinforcements from going to {{the north side of the}} river. Meade was instructed to watch the enemy closely and, if Lee weakened his lines, to make an attack.|$|R
60|$|As we {{went the}} mist grew thinner, {{and we could}} see that we were {{travelling}} down a steep spur of the precipice, which <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> was quite sheer, and that {{at the foot of}} it was a wide plain thickly but not densely covered with trees. In ten minutes we were at the bottom, and as we could neither see nor hear any sign of pursuers we paused for an instant to rest.|$|E
60|$|The sun set, the {{darkness}} fell, {{and it began}} to rain and blow. We started quite unobserved, {{so far as we}} could tell, and, travelling downward from the overgrown, ruined town, gained the old road, and in complete silence, for the feet of camels make no noise, passed along it toward the lights of Harmac, which now and again, when the storm-clouds lifted, we saw glimmering in front of us and somewhat <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning we proceeded up the valley, towards a very steep rocky barrier, through which the river cut a narrow gorge, and beyond which rose lofty snowy mountains: the peak of Tunkra being <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left</b> hand (north). Saxifrages grew here in profuse tufts of golden blossoms, and Chrysosplenium, rushes, mountain-sorrel (Oxyria), and the bladder-headed Saussurea, whose flowers are enclosed in inflated membranous bracts, and smell like putrid meat: there were also splendid primroses, the spikenard valerian, and golden Potentillas.|$|E
6000|$|... "They will be, {{in another}} hour, {{at the foot}} of the {{mountains}} over there <b>to</b> the <b>left.</b> <b>Our</b> business will be to prevent any of the French moving along there, and coming down on your rear." ...|$|R
6000|$|In single file, close together, each man's {{hands on}} the {{shoulders}} of the man in front, we marched on into another large hall. Here we were ranged up against the wall in a long line and ordered <b>to</b> strip <b>our</b> <b>left</b> arms. A youth, a medical student who was getting in his practice on cattle such as we, came down the line. He vaccinated just about four times as rapidly as the barbers shaved. With a final caution <b>to</b> avoid rubbing <b>our</b> arms against anything, and to let the blood dry so as to form the scab, we were led away <b>to</b> <b>our</b> cells. Here my pal and I parted, but not before he had time to whisper to me, [...] "Suck it out." ...|$|R
60|$|These boats {{proved to}} be roomy and comfortable, having flat bows and sterns, since, {{although}} sometimes a sail was hoisted, they were designed for towing, not to be rowed with oars. Leo and I entered the largest of them, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> joy were <b>left</b> alone except for the steersman.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} now, Tom," [...] Guy said. [...] "I have {{concluded}} my business with this gentleman. We {{will not go}} back the way we came," [...] he went on, as they issued into the street, [...] "for I am sure we should never find our way through those alleys. Let us keep along here until {{we come to a}} broader street leading the way we wish to go; fortunately, with the river <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> we cannot go very far wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{minute or}} two later John Dunn and his {{following}} departed, as he said, {{to try to make}} peace with the advancing Usutu. Umbelazi, Saduko and their escort departed also towards {{the main body of the}} host of the Isigqosa, which was massed <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> [...] "sitting on their spears," [...] as the natives say, and awaiting the attack. As for me, I remained alone with the Amawombe, drinking some coffee that Scowl had brewed for me, and forcing myself to swallow food.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{must not}} waste time in talking politics. I see the men have {{finished}} their breakfast, and {{we are here to}} hunt. I shall keep twenty horse with me; the rest will enter the forest with you. I have arranged for the peasants here to guide you. You will march two miles along by the edge of the forest, and then enter it and make a wide semicircle, leaving men as you go, until you come down {{to the edge of the}} forest again, a mile <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
40|$|Case 1 : A 56 -year-old man visited us {{complaining}} of gross hematuria. Because of {{his refusal to}} undergo a surgical operation, we performed embolization and chemotherapy, which were ineffective and he died of cancerous cachexia. Case 2 : A 59 -year-old female with microscopic hematuria was referred <b>to</b> <b>our</b> clinic. <b>Left</b> partial nephrectomy and right radical nephrectomy were done in a two-stage operation at a 3 month interval. She is now well without sign of recurrence at 9 months after the last operation...|$|R
5000|$|McCombe {{signed for}} Mansfield Town on a free {{transfer}} in June 2013, and {{was described by}} manager Paul Cox as [...] "a commanding player who will add knowledge and experience <b>to</b> <b>our</b> defence". He <b>left</b> Field Mill by mutual consent in January 2014, having made only seven starts for Mansfield in 2013-14.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} 45 -year-old female with left adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} resulting in Cushing syndrome. She visited the 3 rd Department of Internal Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital with complaints of moon face, amenorrhea and hypertension. A diagnosis of left adrenal tumor with Cushing syndrome {{was made and}} she was transferred <b>to</b> <b>our</b> clinic. <b>Left</b> thoracoabdominal adrenalectomy was performed. The histologic report was compatible with adrenocortical carcinoma with no invasion into adjunctive tissues. She is now on endocrinologic study and is being administered 1, 1 -dichloro- 2 -[o-chlorophenyl]- 2 [p-chlorophenyl] ethane. There {{is no evidence of}} local recurrence or remote metastasis...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you are right, Kate; {{if we could}} turn off this road I should not fear, but the river cannot be far to our right, and the main road is <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left.</b> There is nothing for it but to press {{straight}} on. Fortunately, {{the country is not}} thickly populated, and there is a good deal of jungle. If the worst comes to the worst, we must leave our horses and go on foot again. I fear that is more fatiguing for you, but we can hide ourselves a good deal better." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{picked up}} the track and {{followed}} it onward for some distance, but soon the moor rose into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the watercourse behind us. No further help from tracks could be hoped for. At the spot where we saw {{the last of the}} Dunlop tire it might equally have led to Holdernesse Hall, the stately towers of which rose some miles <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> or to a low, gray village which lay in front of us and marked the position of the Chesterfield high road.|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped the}} {{handkerchief}} and leapt to the ground. Now {{he and his}} police were firing rapidly in reply, and men fell fast among the Usutu. They raised their war shout and came on, though slowly, for they feared the bullets. Step by step John Dunn and his people were thrust back, fighting gallantly against overwhelming odds. They were level with us, not {{a quarter of a}} mile <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>left.</b> They were pushed past us. They vanished among the bush behind us, and a long while passed before ever I heard what became of them, for we met no more that day.|$|E
40|$|Eight {{weeks after}} {{uncomplicated}} AICD implantation and uneventful postoperative course, a 17 years old patient was referred <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hospital with <b>left</b> sided pneumothorax and pectoral muscle twitches. A chest x-ray was performed and clearly showed a lung penetrating AICD lead. Surgery {{was performed by}} percutaneous extraction of the lead and implantation of a new AICD. The patient recovered without any further events...|$|R
60|$|On the 30th Hancock {{moved to}} the Totopotomoy, where he found the enemy {{strongly}} fortified. Wright was {{moved to the}} right of Hancock's corps, and Burnside was brought forward and crossed, taking position to the left of Hancock. Warren moved up near Huntley Corners on the Shady Grove Church Road. There was some skirmishing along the centre, and in the evening Early attacked Warren with some vigor, driving him back at first, and threatening <b>to</b> turn <b>our</b> <b>left</b> flank. As the best means of reinforcing the left, Hancock was ordered to attack in his front. He carried and held the rifle-pits. While this was going on Warren got his men up, repulsed Early, and drove him more than a mile.|$|R
60|$|WHEN I was a boy, {{there was}} but one {{permanent}} ambition among my comrades in our village {footnote [1. Hannibal, Missouri]} {{on the west}} bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro minstrel show that came <b>to</b> <b>our</b> section <b>left</b> us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in its turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.|$|R
