25|$|Shi Yan Ming {{was born}} Duan Gen Shan in Zhumadian in Henan Province, China, on Chinese New Year's, February 13, 1964, {{the year of}} the Dragon, the seventh of nine children. His father grew up in a family so poor that they were {{essentially}} homeless, and begged for food door to door. Duan's father, who never went to school, slept under a wood-burning stove, or would dig a hole in a stack of wheat for warmth. Despite these hardships, he taught himself to be a very literate reader, writer and calligrapher. Duan's mother's family was slightly better off financially. As was typical, she was not educated either, had her feet bound, and was raised solely to be a mother and housewife. Duan's parents eventually acquired jobs for the Chinese government under Mao, and worked underground as <b>telex</b> <b>operators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Telex {{served as}} the forerunner of modern fax, email, and texting - both {{technically}} and stylistically. Abbreviated English (like [...] "CU L8R" [...] for [...] "see you later") as used in texting originated with <b>telex</b> <b>operators</b> exchanging informal messages in real time — they became the first [...] "texters" [...] long before the introduction of mobile phones. Telex users could send the same message to several {{places around the world}} at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer. This involved transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (dial code 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union Mailgram.|$|R
50|$|In early 1976, Fekete {{experienced}} a crisis, possibly connected with his sexuality, and {{was placed on}} a course of tranquilizers by a University doctor. This would mark the first official recognition of the lifelong struggle with mental illness he endured his entire life. In June 1976 Fekete failed the engineering sections of his second year examinations, and, rather than returning to London, he chose to go to Italy, before eventually returning to the family home in South London. He chose not to resume his studies at Liverpool, and started working as a <b>telex</b> <b>operator,</b> and redactor of news for various agencies in North London. During this time, his mother began divorce proceedings; his father left the house in June 1975 and the decree nisi came in 1976. Fekete became increasingly focused on his painting, attending evening class and took an A level in History of Art. Through his father, Andrew became friendly with Dame Elizabeth Frink, who encouraged him in his artistic endeavours.|$|E
5000|$|Word of the {{invasion}} first reached Britain from Argentine sources. A Ministry of Defence operative in London had a short telex conversation with Governor Hunt's <b>telex</b> <b>operator,</b> who confirmed that Argentines were {{on the island and}} in control. Later that day, BBC journalist Laurie Margolis spoke with an islander at Goose Green via amateur radio, who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island. Operation Corporate was the codename given to the British military operations in the Falklands War. The commander of task force operations was Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse. Operations lasted from 1 April 1982 to 20 June 1982.The British undertook a series of military operations as a means of recapturing the Falklands from Argentine occupation. The British government had taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, the submarines [...] and [...] were ordered to sail south on 29 March, whilst the stores ship Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Fort Austin was dispatched from the Western Mediterranean to support HMS Endurance. Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments. Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine [...] left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed.|$|E
50|$|Frede Jensen {{was born}} on February 17, 1926 to Hans Jensen and Jenny Kirstine Martinusen in Taarup, Auning county, in the Midtjylland region of Denmark. He spent his first years on a sizable family {{homestead}} and was raised by his two loving parents. Frede was the second of three children born to the Jensen family. The property was home to a lovely forest where oak, pine, and beech trees grew. These early surroundings were likely the mold where Frede's great sensibility to nature was formed. The great depression arrived with its share of sufferings and soon the family had to relocate to a smaller house in the nearby small village of Trojstrup. Frede lived there with his family until {{he graduated from the}} Randers Stattskole in 1945. When he was a young teenager, he loved collecting and drying flowers from the countryside. His collection later ended {{up in the hands of}} the Museum of the Botanical Garden of Copenhagen, which they still preserve today. In 1945, Jensen went to the University of Copenhagen and completed his undergraduate studies in 1949. Jensen then attended the Université de Grenoble in France on a scholarship where he received a degree in French grammar and Philology (Certificat de Grammaire et de Philologie Francaises) in 1950. While in Grenoble he joined a mountaineering club. For him it was the door opened to the undulating slopes of wild flowers, before setting his sights on higher summits later in his life. Jensen returned to Denmark to serve his mandatory 9-month military service from 1950 to 1951 where he served as a <b>telex</b> <b>operator.</b> Jensen then returned to the University of Copenhagen where he received his master's degree, with distinction, in 1953 in French with a minor in English.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the minutes}} before its disappearance, the aircraft's onboard systems {{had sent a}} number of messages, via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), {{indicating}} disagreement in the indicated airspeed (IAS) readings. A spokesperson for the BEA claimed that [...] "the airspeed of the aircraft was unclear" [...] to the pilots and, on 4 June 2009, Airbus issued an Accident Information <b>Telex</b> to <b>operators</b> of all its aircraft reminding pilots of the recommended Abnormal and Emergency Procedures {{to be taken in}} the case of unreliable airspeed indication. French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau said, [...] "Obviously the pilots Flight 447 did not have the correct speed showing, which can lead to two bad consequences {{for the life of the}} aircraft: under-speed, which can lead to a stall, and over-speed, which can lead to the aircraft breaking up because it is approaching the speed of sound and the structure of the plane is not made for enduring such speeds".|$|R
40|$|Banks {{receive a}} wide variety of <b>telex</b> communications. Bank <b>operators</b> must sort these telexes and route them to the {{appropriate}} department for processing. Although certain messages can easily be classified and routed, others require a more thorough understanding of the telex content and bank organization to determine the proper destination. The large num-ber of messages that must be reviewed each day, the urgency of these mes-sages, and the difficulty of maintaining a staff of sufficiently skilled opera-tors all indicate the advantages of automating this task. Thus, Prism is a system that combines case-based and inductive techniques to classify and route bank telexes. Developed by Cognitive Systems, Inc. (CSI), the Prism system has been in continual daily operation at Chase Manhattan Bank’...|$|R
