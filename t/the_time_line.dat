Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time numerous times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line,</b> Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E

Works on the Gippsland electrification was to be completed to Warragul station by 1953, but due to the funding cuts <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line</b> was revised to 1954. 500 of the precut houses were cancelled, the Victorian contribution to joint carriage stock for use on The Overland was cut to 6 sitting cars, and work at Newport Workshops building locomotives, carriages and livestock trucks was suspended. Outside rolling stock contractors were also told to slow down, and to defer claims for progress payments until the 1953-54 financial year.|$|E
25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that person. Because the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line</b> where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only sign of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E
500|$|The first paper {{seemed to}} point out a contradiction between the {{electrodynamic}} theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c2. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper [...] "Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass" [...] in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal Physikalische Zeitschrift in 1922. That year, Fermi submitted his article [...] "On the phenomena occurring near a world line" [...] (...) to the Italian journal I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei. In this article he examined the Principle of Equivalence, and introduced the so-called [...] "Fermi coordinates". He proved that on a world line close to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line,</b> space behaves {{as if it were}} a Euclidean space.|$|E

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line</b> that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration.

Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line.</b> Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Huastecs built small {{cities and}} {{ceremonial}} centers, they never reached {{the size and}} complexity of others in Mesoamerica.

It was explained that the visitors were beamed aboard the Starship Enterprise to [...] "what you would call the future" [...] and the group was led to the bridge. Commander Riker appeared on the main viewscreen. Riker explained that Captain Picard disappeared the moment the group beamed aboard the Enterprise and thus one member of the group must be Picard's ancestor. A Klingon Commander named Korath used a time-rift to abduct Picard's ancestor and erase him from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>line.</b> Starfleet Intelligence dispatched the Enterprise to intercept the Klingons' transporter beam and rescue the entire group.
