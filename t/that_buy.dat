25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet states <b>that</b> <b>buy</b> {{gas from}} Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated {{that it would have}} been easier to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, he added that the problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect that there is no such thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two main}} lines of {{business}} in investment banking are called the sell side and the buy side. The [...] "sell side" [...] involves trading securities for cash or for other securities (e.g. facilitating transactions, market-making), or the promotion of securities (e.g. underwriting, research, etc.). The [...] "buy side" [...] involves the provision of advice to institutions <b>that</b> <b>buy</b> investment services.

2500|$|ETFs <b>that</b> <b>buy</b> {{and hold}} {{commodities}} or futures of commodities have become popular. For example, SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has 21 million ounces in trust.

In {{the words of the}} IMF, “Some market participants believe the growing popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have contributed to equity price appreciation in some emerging economies, and warn that leverage embedded in ETFs could pose financial stability risks if equity prices were to decline for a protracted period.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Syndication and {{securitization}} {{also lead}} to greater risk distribution. Commercial and industrial (C) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across {{a greater number of}} participating banks and non-bank lenders. Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)-special purpose entities <b>that</b> <b>buy</b> C loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures. CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated debt securities issued to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Indeed, in recent years, the share of syndicated C term loans funded by institutional investors is estimated to have exceed that funded by commercial banks." ...|$|E

5000|$|Equation {{describes}} a firm <b>that</b> <b>buys</b> and sells on account. Also, the equation is written {{to accommodate a}} firm <b>that</b> <b>buys</b> and sells on account. For a cash-only firm, the equation would only need data from sales operations (e.g. changes in inventory), because disbursing cash would be directly measurable as purchase of inventory, and collecting cash would be directly measurable as sale of inventory. However, no such 1:1 correspondence exists for a firm <b>that</b> <b>buys</b> and sells on account: Increases and decreases in inventory do not occasion cashflows but accounting vehicles (payables and receivables, respectively); increases and decreases in cash will remove these accounting vehicles (receivables and payables, respectively) from the books. Thus, the CCC must be calculated by tracing a change in cash through its effect upon receivables, inventory, payables, and finally back to cash—thus, the term cash conversion cycle, and the observation that these four accounts [...] "articulate" [...] with one another.|$|R
