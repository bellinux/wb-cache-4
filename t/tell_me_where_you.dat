6000|$|... 'This is of {{far greater}} moment to me' said Clennam, in great agitation, 'than you can imagine. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> knew the man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, Maisie. Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live? I {{must see}} you again; and perhaps I could help you. I--I paint a little myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has not escaped," [...] {{the officer}} said, [...] "for {{the house is}} surrounded. Now, madam, I insist upon your <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have hidden him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right; it doesn't {{matter a}} bit. But <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> are <b>you</b> going {{when you get}} back to London--back to Miss Starbrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Palaver!' cried Charles, fully {{sensible}} of {{the advantage}} his illness gave him. 'I want the facts. Begin at the beginning. Sit down--there's a chair by <b>you.</b> Now <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> did <b>you</b> find him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You needn't {{be afraid}} of anything; we are friends here, poor woman. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> come from and what you want,' said the lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodbye, Maisie. Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live? I {{must see}} you again; and perhaps I could help you. I--I paint a little myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{be afraid}} of anything; we are friends here, poor woman! <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> came from, and what you want," [...] said she.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where shall I find him? angels, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where.</b> [...] <b>You</b> know him; he is near you; point him out. [...] Shall I see glories beaming {{from his}} brow, [...] Or trace his {{footsteps}} by the rising flowers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right or wrong," [...] {{said the}} Patchwork Girl, [...] "to be {{different}} {{is to be}} distinguished. Now in my case, I'm just like all other Patchwork Girls because I'm the only one there is. But <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> did <b>you</b> come from?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You mustn't {{answer me}} in that way, child; I'm not playing with you. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were born, and who your father and mother were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} leave my clothes alone and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are going," [...] Jeanne declared, a little tartly, [...] "it {{would be more}} reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think there}} is no doubt of my identity. Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> uncle is, Miss Hannay? I have to make my report to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{have found}} her {{it will be}} time to defend her beauty! If your ladyship would only <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> she is, <b>you</b> know not what {{gratitude}} I should feel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} to Oz," [...] said the girl Ruler, in gracious accents. [...] "But <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> sir, <b>where</b> did <b>you</b> get the Love Magnet which you say you own?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{never mind}} that. There's {{no sense in}} {{worrying}} oneself about the future. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> dad, <b>where</b> did <b>you</b> get all the 'dinner-is-served, madam' stuff? How did you ever learn to be a butler?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '--But,' resumed the old gentleman, 'perhaps I {{may want}} to know {{something}} more about you, so <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live, and I'll put it down in my pocket-book.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You mustn't {{answer me}} like that, child,' said Miss Ophelia sternly. 'I am not playing with you. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were born, and who {{your father and}} mother were.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So then I {{need not}} repeat what I said," [...] quoth the other lightly. [...] "Hanging for you, my man, unless you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have hidden Jongejuffrouw Beresteyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{come across}} her," [...] Stella said, [...] "I {{will do what}} I can. If you see her again, and I should think you are the more likely, find out her address and I will go and see her. By the by," [...] she added, leaning across the table towards him, [...] "you seem very {{confident}} of preserving it. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> do <b>you</b> keep that paper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think where}} {{she could have been}} going," [...] said Clym to some one. [...] "She had evidently walked a long way, but even when she was able to speak just now she would not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where.</b> What do <b>you</b> really think of her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I don't know. Yes, I do. Do {{you know}} whether that cottage <b>you</b> were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about <b>where</b> <b>you</b> lived while you were away from here, is to let? That will do nicely, for there I should be away from every one. Get me a box from the lumber room, and tell Harriet {{to go out and}} get me a post chaise from the Red Lion as soon as my son has gone to the mill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can I {{come to see}} you if {{you don't}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are? [...] "Lady Georgina Fawley, Europe," [...] was the only address I knew. It strikes me as insufficient.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} lie to me!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "It {{is not worth}} while. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> met her, why you were with her at all in that {{intimate}} fashion, and where she is now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your defence is your certain {{immunity}} from attack. Perhaps if you won't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are staying, you will kindly ask Miss Tarrant herself to do so. Would she {{send me a}} word on a card?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Jeff," [...] {{returned}} the spinster promptly, [...] "were not scissors and razors provided by--no, it was art that provided them," [...] she continued {{with a little}} smile of confusion; [...] "but they are provided all the same, and--But we won't pursue that subject, for you men are incorrigible! Now <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Jeff, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have been, and why you didn't {{come to see me}} sooner, and why your letters have been so few--though I admit they were long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For {{the love}} of God,' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, 'do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> they are. <b>You</b> know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; {{that there is no}} hope of any further gain. Where are those papers?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I was, {{for a few}} weeks. But {{they ended}} yesterday. I was furious that morning, when I learned your flight, and during the week that {{followed}} I made two or three attempts to find you. Then I stopped--I thought it better. I saw you were very well hidden; I determined not even to write. I felt I could wait--with that last day at Marmion to think of. Besides, to leave you with her awhile, for the last, seemed more decent. Perhaps you'll <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Hubert dear," [...] {{said his}} mother; [...] "don't be frightened, only come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> and Con went yesterday, when {{the others were}} playing at bowls." [...] Hubert hung his head, {{and looked at his}} brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish you'd go home, mamma, {{and let me}} {{catch her}} in the library by herself. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live, and I'll come {{in the evening and}} tell you all about it. That is, if you have no objection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{will you}} not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{are going after}} the marriage? I could be at the wedding if I liked, and learn in that way," [...] said Lydia, not {{shrinking}} from the one suicidal form of threat within her power.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, how horrid those {{catching}} things are! I've {{not seen}} Ivinghoe all this winter! Ah! {{but they are}} good sometimes! If {{it had not been}} for the measles, I should never have had that most delicious time at Silverfold, nor known Mysie. Now, please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have been, and what you have been doing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] {{she said}} as she shook hands with a very {{influential}} but very doubtful voter of the farmer class, [...] "but I don't know anything about English politics; so I can't talk to you about it as I'd like to. But you know I am going to marry Mr. Walmsley and come to live here, and it would be so nice to feel that all my friends had voted for him. If you have a few minutes to spare, Mr. Brown, would <b>you</b> please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> don't agree with Paul? I should so much like to hear, because he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that if once you were on his side he would feel almost comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} Pasha, smiling, and drawing a great cloud from his chibouk, [...] "I'm as glad as yourself, {{and not the}} less so that I've {{been able to do}} you some small service in the way of {{preventing}} your neck from being stretched; and that brings me to the chief point for which I have brought you to my palace, namely, to talk about matters which concern yourself, for it is obvious that you cannot remain in this country in time of war with safety unless you have some fixed position. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> now, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have been and what doing since we last met in Scotland, and I will tell you what can be done for you in Turkey." ...|$|R
