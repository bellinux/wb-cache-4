25|$|While {{the concept}} of Heaven (malkuth hashamaim מלכות השמים, the Kingdom of Heaven) is much {{discussed}} within the Christian and Islamic religions, the Jewish concept of the afterlife, sometimes known as olam haba, the World-to-come, is not discussed so often. The Torah has little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of survival after death, {{but by the time}} of the rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought, is that of the immortal soul which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin, is that of resurrection of the dead.|$|E

Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though {{the total number of}} university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year olds in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16–18% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence.|$|E

After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief.

Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single [...] "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney had this <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success {{would have a hard}} job... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping." [...] In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.|$|E

[...] Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat, but it began to wane after the seat moved, and today no trace is left. [...] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township, but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject. [...] Brisco was never large, though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s. It likewise disappeared {{by the end of}} the 20thcentury. Chatterton had a school, a store and a post office, but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps. [...] Other communities were planned but did not develop. [...] Dresser was never much more than a collection of houses, though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20thcentury. [...] The settlements of Kickapoo, Locust Grove, Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect. [...] Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder's residence and a liquor store, and was later described as a [...] "paper town".|$|E

This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation.

But again, on the other hand, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged writings of the apostle, to this also everyone will consent as true who has given attention to reading the apostle…. But as for myself, if I were to state my own opinion, I should say that the thoughts are the apostle’s, but that the style and composition belonged to one who called to mind the apostle’s teachings and, as it were, made short notes of what his master said. If any church, therefore, holds this epistle as Paul’s, let it be commended for this also. For not without reason have the men of old handed it down as Paul’s.
