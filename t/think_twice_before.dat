500|$|... "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com awarded [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] {{a rating of}} four stars out of five, praising the song's [...] "ingratiating party mood" [...] and Derulo's [...] "energetic vocal performance". He also {{went on to say}} that [...] "Jason Derulo should have no problem taking back his place on pop radio playlists and pulling the Beluga Heights sound back into the spotlight." [...] Scott Shelter from PopCrush wrote that, [...] "Despite the track's lack of originality, the beat is irresistible, and its lyrics about staying out all night are likely to resonate with summer partiers," [...] and concluded by writing that it is [...] "a song that succeeds in spite of its shortcomings." [...] A writer for Beatweek magazine praised Derulo for sampling [...] "Day-O" [...] into the song's chorus, writing that [...] "'Don't Wanna Go Home' is yet the latest evidence that Derulo can create a song in any genre, using any kind of samples, and turn it into a hit." [...] Robbie Daw from Idolator wrote that, [...] "Compared to his last few mediocre offerings, this single actually seems to have some fire" [...] courtesy of the samples in the song. However, Daw concluded by writing that [...] "if Derulo wants to achieve any kind of credibility in the pop world, he'd better establish his own sound fast." [...] Meena Rupani from DesiHits felt that Derulo [...] "should <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he takes his lyrics from others." [...] Shahryar Rizvi from Dallas Observer called Derulo a [...] "lousy sampler", writing that [...] "all this song boasts is Derulo throwing airballs". At the 2011 Teen Choice Awards, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] was nominated for 'Choice R/Hip Hop Track' accolade.|$|E
2500|$|Marchant {{found that}} in the [...] "age of suicide bombers", the Secret Service should have {{latitude}} {{to get rid of}} anyone suspicious who is standing near the president's route. However, given that the reason Bursey was singled out by the Secret Service was his sign, [...] "it's enough to make anyone with a dissenting view <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> deciding to stand out from a crowd." ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing {{international}} condemnation for the attack, Ben-Gurion {{denied that}} the Israeli military was involved. In his memoir, Sharon wrote that the unit had checked all the houses before detonating the explosives and that he thought the houses were empty. Although he admitted the results were tragic, Sharon defended the attack, however: [...] "Now people could feel that the terrorist gangs would <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> striking, now that they knew for sure they would be hit back. Kibbya also put the Jordanian and Egyptian governments on notice that if Israel was vulnerable, so were they." ...|$|E

60|$|Leyden sang; but now {{the stream}} is very much tainted indeed below Hawick, like Tweed in too many places. Thus, for a dozen reasons, trout are nigh as rare as red deer. Clearburn alone remains full of unsophisticated fishes, and I have the less {{hesitation}} in revealing this, because I do not expect the wanderer who may read this page to be at all more successful than myself. No doubt they are sometimes to be had, by the basketful, but not often, nor by him who <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> risking his life by smothering in a peaty bottom.|$|R

6000|$|CUTHBERTSON (compassionately). You mustn't {{think about}} that, Craven: {{perhaps he was}} mistaken. (He sighs deeply and sits down.) But he is {{certainly}} a very clever fellow. He <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he commits himself. (They sit in silence, full of the gloomiest thoughts. Suddenly Paramore enters, pale and in the utmost disorder, with the British Medical Journal in his clenched hand. They rise in alarm. He tries to speak, but chokes, clutches at his throat, and staggers. Cuthbertson quickly takes his chair and places it behind Paramore, who sinks into it as they crowd about him, Craven at his right shoulder, Cuthbertson on his left, and Julia behind Craven.) ...|$|R

Is it for my own sake? Oh, my boy! my darling boy! will you lose {{everything}} in life, because you love the child with whom you have played as a child?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a pop-dance and {{freestyle}} song co-written by Alanis Morissette, Leslie Howe, Louise Reny and Frank Levin, {{and produced}} by Howe for Morissette's debut album, Alanis (1991). Its protagonist sends {{a warning to}} her boyfriend who [...] "never <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he break all the rules", telling him [...] "I'll walk away and say good bye if you don't want me anymore ... if I don't get the love we had before". It was released to radio and television as the album's second single in 1991 (see 1991 in music), {{but it was not}} given a commercial release. The promotional single for the song includes a radio edit only. The song charted at number 35 in Canada. It was also featured in the film Problem Child 2.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it isn't quite such {{a crying}} sin yet. But really, really," [...] exclaimed Sewell, [...] "the world seems so put {{together}} that I believe {{we ought to}} <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> doing a good action." ...|$|E
60|$|I really cannot {{answer these}} questions, and unless Mr. Lilly can, I {{think he would}} do well {{hereafter}} to <b>think</b> more than <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> attributing such preposterous notions to his fellow-men, who, after all, as a learned counsel said, are vertebrated animals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely all. The moment I {{saw your}} card, I thought to myself, in a breath: 'Ford, Cumberledge; what do I know {{of those two}} names? I have some link between them. Ah, yes; found Mrs. Cumberledge, wife of Colonel Thomas Cumberledge, of the 7th Bengals, was a Miss Ford, {{daughter}} of a Mr. Ford, of Bangor.' That came {{to me like a}} lightning-gleam. Then I said to myself again, 'Dr. Hubert Ford Cumberledge must be their son.' So there you have 'the train of reasoning.' Women CAN reason--sometimes. I had to <b>think</b> <b>twice,</b> though, <b>before</b> I could recall the exact words of the Times notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{here there}} is {{provided}} for you an income on which you can live. Not a soul will know anything about it. Even your own father need not be told. As for the lawyer, that is nothing. They never talk of things. It would make a man comparatively poor quite a fit match. Or, {{if you do not}} marry, it would enable you to live where you pleased independently of me. You had better <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> of it <b>before</b> you refuse it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He put {{his hand}} to his face and felt the two weals running across it, hot and fat. [...] "I'll <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> I lift my hand against a lunatic again," [...] said Sir John Gotch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would that I were a man!" [...] exclaimed Freydissa, {{catching}} up a spear and shaking {{it as she}} strode along with the rest. [...] "I'd teach them to <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> coming here to disturb peaceable folk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I {{ought to}} <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> taking a {{stranger}} into my family," [...] said Belding, seriously. [...] "Well, I guess he's all right, Laddy, being the cavalryman's friend. No bum or lunger? He must be all right?" ...|$|E
60|$|The two arbitrators {{selected}} by the opposed parties to the controversy are to agree to leave the decision to a third party unanimously chosen by themselves. That is very {{far from being a}} simple solution. An attempt to shorten and simplify the passing of the Finance Bill by referring it to an arbitrator chosen unanimously by Mr. Asquith and Mr. Balfour might not improbably cost more and last longer than a civil war. And why should the chosen referee--if he ever succeeded in getting chosen--be assumed to be a safer authority than the Examiner of Plays? He would certainly be a less responsible one: in fact, being (however eminent) a casual person called in to settle a single case, he would be virtually irresponsible. Worse still, he would take all responsibility away from the Lord Chamberlain, who is at least an official of the King's Household and a nominee of the Government. The Lord Chamberlain, with all his shortcomings, <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he refuses a licence, knowing that his refusal is final and may promptly be made public. But if he could transfer his responsibility to an arbitrator, he would naturally do so whenever he felt the slightest misgiving, or whenever, for diplomatic reasons, the licence would come more gracefully from an authority unconnected with the court. These considerations, added to the general objection to the principle of censorship, seem sufficient to put the arbitration expedient quite out of the question.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{an article}} on 50 terms that, in the {{interest}} of clarity in scientific reasoning and communication in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields, “should be avoided or at most be used sparingly and only with explicit caveats,” 1 we propose a list of terms to avoid or <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about <b>before</b> using when writing for the International Journal of Eating Disorders (IJED). Drawing upon our experience as reviewers or editors for the IJED, we generated an abridged list of such terms. For each term, we explain why it made our list and what alternatives we recommend. We hope that our list will contribute to improved clarity in scientific thinking about eating disorders, and that it will stimulate discussion of terms that may need to be reconsidered in our field's vocabulary to ensure the use of language that is respectful and sensitive to individuals who experience an eating disorder...|$|R
6000|$|In America it is {{said that}} the public {{services}} are inferior in personal quality to the staffs of the great private business organizations. My own impression is that, considering the salaries paid, they are, so far as Federal concerns go, immeasurably superior. In State and municipal affairs, American conditions offer no satisfactory criterion; the Americans are, for reasons I have discussed elsewhere,[8] a [...] "State-blind" [...] people concentrated upon private getting; they have been negligent of public concerns, and the public appointments have been left to the peculiarly ruffianly type of politician their unfortunate Constitution and their individualist traditions have evolved. In England, too, public servants are systematically undersalaried, so that the big businesses have merely to pay reasonably well to secure the pick of the national capacity. Moreover, it must be remembered by the reader that the public services do not advertise, and that the private businesses do; so that while there is the fullest ventilation of any defects in our military or naval organization, there is a very considerable check upon the discussion of individualist incapacity. An editor will rush into print with the flimsiest imputations upon the breech of a new field-gun or the housing of the militia at Aldershot, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he proclaims that the preserved fruits that pay his proprietor a tribute of some hundreds a year are an unwholesome embalmment of decay. On the whole it is probable that in spite of scandalously bad pay and of the embarrassment of party considerations, the British Navy, Post Office, and Civil Service generally, and the educational work and much of the transit and building work of the London County Council and of many of the greater English and Scotch municipalities, are as well managed as any private businesses in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you are not," [...] said Carter with {{a certain}} {{bitterness}} of tone. [...] "People {{do all kinds of}} queer things for a living, and I am not particular myself, but I would <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> taking your billet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Faith! I don't mind,' said Loveday. 'But your nephew {{had better}} <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he lets his enmity take that colour.' Receding from the window, {{he took the}} candle to a back part {{of the room and}} soon reappeared with the tin box.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{ring the}} bell for drinks and chuck this!" [...] Dorward exclaimed. [...] "I've had about enough of it. I am not denying {{anything}} you say, but if these fellows really are on board, they'll <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> they meddle with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am now to bid you farewell," [...] said he, [...] "and {{that for}} ever. For now you go among my enemies, where all your former prejudices will revive.

Yes, I tell you, she has thoroughly compromised herself--quite enough, if it is ever known, to spoil any other engagement her father may make. Why, ask Adele! The day of the earthquake she ABSOLUTELY had the audacity to send him out of the room upstairs into your study for her fan, and then follow him up there alone. The servants knew it. I knew it, for I was in her room at the time with Father Antonio. The earthquake made it plain to everybody. Decline it! No. Mr. Mallory will <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about it <b>before</b> he does that. What's that? Who's there?" ...|$|R
60|$|HASLAM. Now I come {{to think}} of it, old Methuselah must have had to <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he took on {{anything}} for life. If I thought I was going to live nine hundred and sixty years, I don't think I should stay in the Church.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Denham laughed. [...] "The {{question}} is, {{where we}} would get the four thousand pounds. We are, as you have no doubt noticed, confoundedly hard-up, and a tenant with capital enough to stand a decent rent would <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> he took a farm from us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I want to {{save you}} from that," [...] Alan cried, leaning over her with real tenderness, for she was already very dear to him. [...] "I {{want to save}} you from yourself; I want to make you <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> you rush headlong into such a danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|The nobles, in like manner, {{have nearly}} ceased either to guide or misguide; and are now, as their master is, {{little more than}} {{ornamental}} figures. It is long since they have done with butchering one another or their king: the Workers, protected, encouraged by Majesty, have ages ago built walled towns, and there ply their crafts; will permit no Robber Baron to 'live by the saddle,' but maintain a gallows to prevent it. Ever since that period of the Fronde, the Noble has changed his fighting sword into a court rapier, and now loyally attends his king as ministering satellite; divides the spoil, not now by violence and murder, but by soliciting and finesse. These men call themselves supports of the throne, singular gilt-pasteboard caryatides in that singular edifice! For the rest, their privileges every way are now much curtailed. That law authorizing a Seigneur, as he returned from hunting, to kill not more than two Serfs, and refresh his feet in their warm blood and bowels, has fallen into perfect desuetude,--and even into incredibility; for if Deputy Lapoule can believe in it, and call for the abrogation of it, so cannot we. (Histoire de la Revolution Francaise, par Deux Amis de la Liberte (Paris, 1793), ii. 212.) No Charolois, for these last fifty years, though never so fond of shooting, has been in use to bring down slaters and plumbers, and see them roll from their roofs; (Lacretelle, Histoire de France pendant le 18me Siecle (Paris, 1819) i. 271.) but contents himself with partridges and grouse. Close-viewed, their industry and function is that of dressing gracefully and eating sumptuously. As for their debauchery and depravity, it is perhaps unexampled since the era of Tiberius and Commodus. Nevertheless, one has still partly a feeling with the lady Marechale: [...] "Depend upon it, Sir, God <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> <b>before</b> damning a man of that quality." [...] (Dulaure, vii. 261.) These people, of old, surely had virtues, uses; or {{they could not have}} been there. Nay, one virtue they are still required to have (for mortal man cannot live without a conscience): the virtue of perfect readiness to fight duels.|$|R
500|$|Themes of {{corruption}} and salvation are brought to the fore as Valérie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him {{to meet with a}} priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: [...] "la mort regarde à deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!" [...] ("Death <b>thinks</b> <b>twice</b> of it <b>before</b> carrying off a Mayor of Paris.") Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: [...] "je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!" [...] ("I can please no one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that will be my last flirtation...!") ...|$|R
60|$|An {{amendment}} stood {{upon the}} notice-paper {{in the name}} of Mr. Collings, regretting the omission from the speech of measures for benefiting the rural labourer; and on this motion an immediate engagement was fought. Time was important. An exasperating debate on coercion with obstruction, disorder, suspensions, would have been a damning prologue to any policy of accommodation. The true significance of the motion was not concealed. On the agrarian aspect of it, the only important feature was the adhesion of Mr. Gladstone, now first formally declared, to the policy of Mr. Chamberlain. The author of the agrarian policy fought out once more {{on the floor of the}} House against Lord Hartington and Mr. Goschen the battle of the platform. It was left for Sir Michael Hicks Beach to remind the House that, whatever the honest mover might mean, the rural labourer had very little to do with the matter, and he implored the gentlemen in front of him to <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> and thrice <b>before</b> they committed the future of this country to the gravest dangers that ever awaited it.|$|R
