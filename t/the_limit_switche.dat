40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two prominent}} institutional {{rules in the}} international trading system: a lim- ited cross-retaliation rule characterized by the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) Article 22. 3 and a limited punishment rule characterized by the General Agreement on Taris and Trade (GATT) Article XXVIII. In general, both rules are designed to <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> countermeasures upon a violation; however, the former rule species <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of composition in retaliation, whereas the latter one designates <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of retaliation magnitude. We show that, albeit seemingly unrelated, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> cross-retaliation rule complements <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> punishment rule in per- mitting greater trade liberalization.

This problem is NP–hard {{and a number of}} heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem. This paper studies two heuristics, <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> granularity heuristic and <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> path heuristic, for solving general –constrained problems. Analytical and simulation studies are conducted to compare the time/space requirements of the heuristics and the effectiveness of the heuristics in finding the paths that satisfy the QoS constraints.
