To cope with these conflicting selective pressures acting in heterogeneous and unpredictable environments, eels have evolved a conditional evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with alternative tactics as a regulation mechanism for migratory plasticity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} was to validate acoustic rhinometry (AR) in a nasal challenge with allergen. METHODS: Nasal response to allergen provocation was based on clinical and symptom scores, cross-sectional changes of the nasal mucosa as measured by AR with the Rhinoklack system, and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), in atopic and nonatopic volunteers. RESULTS: After allergen challenge, mean variation in minimal cross-sectional area (deltaMCA), as measured by AR, or in peak nasal inspiratory flow (deltaPNIF) in nonatopic volunteers, was - 0. 4 +/- 14. 3 % and 5. 2 +/- 15. 7 %, respectively, compared to baseline. This allowed the determination of a <b>reaction</b> <b>threshold</b> of - 29 % for deltaMCA and of - 26 % for deltaPNIF.

40|$|Considerable {{theoretical}} and empirical effort {{has been focused on}} the potential of continuously variable sexual traits to honestly indicate male quality, but relatively little effort has been devoted to a similar evolutionary role for dimorphic traits. Male dimorphisms, associated with conditionally expressed alterna-tive reproductive tactics, represent extreme phenotypic plasticity. Evidence suggests that considerable heri-table variation exists in the ‘liability ’ underlying many threshold traits; if this liability is correlated with the genetic quality of males, dimorphic traits have the potential to be reliable indicators. We investigated the genetic architecture of phenotypically plastic morph expression in the context of condition-dependent signalling theory. Male morph in the mite Sancassania berlesei is condition dependent: ‘fighters ’ armed with thickened and sharp third pairs of legs emerge from heavier nymphs than unarmoured ‘scramblers’. We selected on male morph in three replicate ‘fighter ’ and ‘scrambler ’ lines and recorded a significant response to selection over seven generations; this was due to a shift in the <b>threshold</b> <b>reaction</b> norm but the lines showed no correlated response in condition.

The wings of the nymphalid butterfly, "Bacilus anynana," have a series of eyespots, each composed of a white pupil, a black disc and a gold outer ring. In earlier extirpation and transplantation experiments (Nijhout 1980 a, French and Brakefield, 1995) it has been established that these eyespots are indeed organized around groups of signaling cells active during the first hours of pupal development. If these cells were to supply the positional information for eyespot formation in accordance with Nijhouts diffusion-degradation gradient model, then, when two foci are close together, the signals should sum, and this effect should be apparent in the detailed shape of the resulting pigment pattern. We give an equation for the form of the contours that would be obtained in this manner. We use this to test the morphogen gradient hypothesis on measurements of the outlines of fused eyespots obtained either by grafting focal cells close together, or by using a mutation ("Spotty") that produces adjacent fused eyespots. The contours of the fused patterns were found to satisfy our equation, thus corroborating Nijhouts hypothesis to the extent possible with this particular type of experiment...|$|E

In this work we compare detection thresholds obtained with a three-interval-three-alternative forced-choice paradigm with <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds</b> extracted from both reaction probabilities (RP) and reaction times (RT) in a simple RT paradigm from the same listeners under otherwise nearly identical experimental conditions. Detection thresholds, RP, and RT to auditory stimuli exhibited substantial variation from session to session. Most of the intersession variation in RP and RT could {{be accounted for by}} intersession variation in a listener's absolute sensitivity. The <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds</b> extracted from RP were very similar, if not identical, to those extracted from RT.

The difference between the two thresholds can be considered as the additional amount of evidence required by each listener to react to a stimulus in an unforced design on top of that necessary for detection in the forced-choice design. This difference is inversely related to the listener's probability of producing false alarms. We found that RT, once corrected for some irreducible minimum RT, reflects the time at which a given stimulus reaches the listener's <b>reaction</b> <b>threshold.</b> This suggests that the relationships between simple RT and loudness (reported in the literature) are probably caused by a tight relationship between temporal summation at threshold and temporal summation of loudness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{previous}} studies have been suggested that tolerance, sensitivity and pain threshold are different between men and women. These differences can be affected by various factors. In this study, the effect of gonadectomy on gender differences in thermal pain threshold was tested by hot plate method in rats. Therefore the reaction time (The delay occurred in response to thermal stimulus) at zero, 15 and 30 minutes was registrated. Mean of those 3 values was respected as thermal pain sense threshold. Then the gonads were occluded and the pain sense threshold at 7 th, 21 st and 35 th days was measured. The results were compared between sexes and also in each sex in different days. The results showed no gender differences before gonadectomy. However after gonadectomy the thermal pain threshold was decreased in both sexes and reached to its minimum value on 21 st day an returned to basal value on day 35 in both sexes. Although this reduction was more dominant in males, no significant difference was observed between sexes. Gonadectomy in males caused a significant reduction of pain threshold in 7 th and 21 st days. Gonadectomy in females had no effect. In conclusion it seems that female sex hormones {{have no effect on}} thermal pain threshold, but testosterone was effective. Since pain sense threshold was also returned to basal value in male rats, we concluded that stimulatory effect of testosterone (up to day 21) may be more important than its organizational effect that appear after 30 th day.

Extending an earlier work (Ooi & He, 2001) that measured global SED within the central 6 °, {{the current study}} measured SED locally at 17 locations within the central 8 ° of the binocular visual field. The eccentricities (radius) chosen for this, “binocular perimetry”, study were 0 ° (fovea), 2 ° and 4 °. At each eccentricity, eight concentric locations (polar angle: 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 225 °, 270 °, and 315 °) were tested. The outcome, an SED map, sets up comparison between local SED and other visual functions [monocular contrast threshold, binocular disparity <b>threshold,</b> <b>reaction</b> time to detect depth, the dynamics of binocular rivalry and motor eye dominance]. Our analysis shows that an observer’s SED varies gradually across the binocular visual field both in its sign and magnitude. The strong eye channel revealed in the SED measurement does not always have a lower monocular contrast threshold, and {{does not need to}} be the motor dominant eye. There exists significant correlation between SED and binocular disparity threshold, and between SED and the response time to detect depth of a random-dot stereogram. A significant correlation is also found between SED and the eye that predominates when viewing an extended duration binocular rivalry stimulus. While it is difficult to attribute casual factors based on correlation analyses, these observations agree with the notion that an imbalance of interocular inhibition, which is largely revealed as SED, is a significant factor impeding binocular visual perception...|$|E
40|$|Steven Impact Tests were {{performed}} at low velocity on the explosives TNT (trinitrotolulene), Composition B (63 % RDX, 36 % TNT, and 1 % wax by weight), C- 4 (91 % RDX, 5. 3 % Di (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate, 2. 1 % Polyisobutylene, and 1. 6 % motor oil by weight) and ANFO (94 % ammonium Nitrate with 6 % Fuel Oil) {{in attempts to}} obtain a <b>threshold</b> for <b>reaction.</b> A 76 mm helium driven gas gun was used to accelerate the Steven Test projectiles up to approximately 200 m/s in attempts to react (ignite) the explosive samples. Blast overpressure gauges, acoustic microphones, standard video and high-speed photography were used to characterize the level of any high explosive reaction violence. No bulk reactions were observed in the TNT, Composition B, C- 4 or ANFO explosive samples impacted up to velocities {{in the range of}} 190 - 200 m/s. This work will outline the experimental details and discuss the lack of reaction when compared to the <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds</b> of other common explosives. These results will also be compared to that of the Susan Test and <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds</b> observed in the common small-scale safety tests such as the drop hammer and friction tests in hopes of drawing a correlation...|$|R
50|$|EMG The {{electrical}} muscular {{response is}} recorded {{through the use}} of a dedicated sensor. Also in this case the signal gets digitized and elaborated by software that defines the <b>thresholds</b> of <b>reaction</b> of the individual and that compares the output data. We take in consideration the area related to facial muscles, particularly the forehead and eyebrows, as they tend to have a more pronounced reaction to emotional activation.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model of}} fish {{reaction}} to vessel noise is made. The fish {{are assumed to}} swim directly away from the noise source. The main noise source {{is assumed to be}} the propeller. Parameters for endurance and swimming speed are obtained from the literature. The initiating stimuli in the model are the loudness and/or the change in loudness. A sensitivity analysis is used to check the importance of the parameters. The model is very sensitive to vessel noise and the fish <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds.</b> This is an artefact of the dB-scale used in the loudness measure. However, if the fish interpret the dB-scale as almost linear, this may also explain some of the variability in vessel avoidance problems. A small change in the <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds,</b> may lead to significant changes in the resulting behaviour. If the task is to model fish reaction to vessels, emphasis should be put on the <b>reaction</b> <b>thresholds</b> and noise field around the vessel, rather than swimming speeds and endurance. In general the parameters describing the physiology are less sensitive than the parameters describing the behaviour...|$|R
