5|$|After the {{completion}} of the 2010 season, the Crimson Tide signed a highly rated recruiting class in February 2011 and completed spring practice the following April. With seventeen returning starters from the previous season, Alabama entered their 2011 campaign ranked as <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>two</b> team in the nation and as a favorite to win the Western Division and compete for the SEC championship. However, Alabama lost to the LSU Tigers in their regular season matchup, and as a result did not qualify for the 2011 SEC Championship Game. Despite not winning their conference championship, when the final Bowl Championship Series rankings were released, Alabama had <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>two</b> ranking to qualify for the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the rematch against LSU, the Crimson Tide defeated the Tigers 21–0 to capture their second BCS Championship in three years.|$|E

50|$|Number Six {{returns to}} <b>Number</b> <b>Two's</b> house <b>the</b> {{following}} day, but he meets a different <b>Number</b> <b>Two.</b> This <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> is older and tells Number Six {{that he is}} aware of the warning - in fact, Number Six has warned every previous <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> that they are to be assassinated, and he is not concerned because he is about to retire. Number Six is shown footage of himself purportedly warning previous <b>Number</b> <b>Twos,</b> which has actually been cut together from the film of his meeting with <b>the</b> younger <b>Number</b> <b>Two.</b> <b>Number</b> Six says that the film is fake and that the plot is being mastered by his successor (<b>the</b> younger <b>Number</b> <b>Two).</b> <b>The</b> older <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> starts to believe Number Six, as his employers are not the sort of people who pay pensions. <b>The</b> younger <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> assures <b>Number</b> One that <b>the</b> assassination will proceed successfully.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the series, <b>the</b> various <b>Number</b> <b>Twos</b> try {{to break}} Number Six with their will. A variety of interrogation, intimidation, drugs, and mind control {{techniques}} are used by sequential <b>Number</b> <b>Twos.</b> <b>Number</b> Six's importance usually prevents the use of brutal methodsroutinely employed on other prisonersagainst him (this policy was ignored by <b>the</b> female <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> at <b>the</b> end of [...] "Free For All").|$|R
5000|$|The first episode, [...] "Arrival", {{established}} that the people holding <b>the</b> position of <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> were rotated on a regular basis. Some fans have interpreted the removal of a <b>Number</b> <b>Two</b> exclusively as a punishment for failure, but {{there were only two}} individuals who actually fit this categorization. The episode [...] "Free for All" [...] initially suggests that <b>Number</b> <b>Twos</b> are [...] "democratically elected by the people." [...] However, this was ultimately revealed to {{have been part of the}} attempt used by <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Two(s)</b> of that episode to break Number Six.|$|R

5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>two</b> position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

Fischer's recent results and record Elo rating made him the pre-match favorite. Other observers, however, noted that Fischer had never won a game against Spassky.|$|E

5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>two</b> 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E

However, a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the characters' confusing names and the writing style. Moonrise held <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>two</b> spot on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's chapter books for two weeks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> various <b>Number</b> <b>Twos</b> seem to {{make use}} of several symbols of their authority.

This is only seen in one episode, [...] "It's Your Funeral". The two more visible signs are a multicoloured scarf, and a colourful cross between an umbrella and a shooting stick (used as a cane). Most, though not all, of <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Twos</b> seem to use these symbolic objects.|$|R

The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed.
