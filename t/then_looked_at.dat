500|$|Justice Stanley Matthews {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the unanimous court. [...] Matthews noted that Crow Dog was indicted for murder under a statute prohibiting murder on federal land. Matthews <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the federal laws dealing with Indians, including a statute that applied the prohibition on murder to Indian reservations and another covering exceptions to prosecution. The first statute prohibited murder on federal land, the second statute applied the first statute to reservations, and the last had specific exceptions to prosecution. Matthews felt that this last section was the most critical one in the case, with the section stating unequivocally that federal law: [...] "shall not be construed to extend to [...] any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe" [...] (brackets in original). Matthews rejected the contention of the United States that the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie implicitly repealed the exceptions to prosecution. He stated that since the law had not been amended or changed, and since implied repeals are not favored unless the implication is necessary, to allow such a repeal would be to reverse the general policy of the United States. Matthews said that such a repeal required a [...] "clear expression of the intention of Congress," [...] which was not present in the case. In a clear evocation of the principle of tribal sovereignty, Matthews stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> herself in the mirror and cried.|$|E
2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E
2500|$|On 4 August 2011 at {{the interim}} results {{announcement}} for Hutchison Whampoa, Li endorsed Henry Tang for the forthcoming chief executive election. Then Li said [...] "You all {{can be just}} like me, one-person-one-vote (一人一票)." [...] The media <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Li in disbelief, and pointed out that regular citizens do not get one-person-one-vote. Li then tried to laugh it off and said [...] "maybe in 2017 they will have one-person-one-vote to choose the chief executive, I probably just said it a little early." [...] Li was, however, criticised by Xinhua for not being unambiguous in {{his opposition to the}} Umbrella movement protests and his support for Leung. Later, prior to the Legco vote, Li said that the largest threat to Hong Kong's future was if the government failed to ensure passage of the 2014–5 round of political reform.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God {{was in front of}} my eyes - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E
