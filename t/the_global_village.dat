The initial pilot studies for the Peace Corps were conducted by Colorado State faculty, and the university is consistently one of the top-ranking institutions in the nation for the recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers. Since 1988, CSU and the Peace Corps have participated in four cooperative master's degree programs in English, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Natural Resources, and Agriculture. The program involves at least 2 semesters of course work at CSU combined with time abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer. Colorado State offers various programs on campus for students interested in international issues. Regional specializations with core courses and electives are available in Asian Studies, Middle East/North Africa Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central Europe Studies. <b>The</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Village</b> Living Learning Community is a housing option for students with international interests.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, McLuhan {{wrote that the}} visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called [...] "{{electronic}} interdependence": when electronic media replaces visual culture with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a [...] "tribal base." [...] McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>village.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{satellite}} medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in {{a man-made}} environment, which [...] "ends 'Nature' {{and turns the}} globe into a repertory theater to be programmed." [...] All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term global theater. It serves as an update to his older concept of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>village,</b> which, in its own definitions, {{can be said to}} be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.|$|E

2500|$|The Boston Globes Wesley Morris {{raved about}} the leading actress: [...] "Julianne Moore {{is a star}} for these terrible times. She tends to be at her best when the world is at its worst. And things are pretty bad in [...] "Blindness," [...] a perversely enjoyable, {{occasionally}} harrowing adaptation of José Saramago's 1995 disaster allegory. [...] "Blindness" [...] is a movie whose sense of crisis feels right on time, even if the happy ending feels like a gratuitous emotional bailout. Meirelles ensures that the obviousness of the symbolism (in <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>village</b> the blind need guidance!) doesn't negate the story's power, nor the power of Moore's performance. The more dehumanizing things get, the fiercer she becomes." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{third term}} of <b>The</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Village</b> that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. The tetrad is {{something}} like threads in a complexly interwoven flowing superspace, a four-fold pattern of transformation. [...] "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." [...] Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, <b>The</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Village,</b> McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E
