5|$|P. lujiatunensis, {{named in}} 2006 by Chinese {{paleontologist}} Zhou Chang-Fu and three Chinese colleagues, {{is one of}} the oldest known species, based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, near the village of Lujiatun. While <b>this</b> <b>bed</b> has been dated differently by different authors, from 128Ma in the Barremian stage, to 125Ma in the earliest Aptian, revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old. P. lujiatunensis was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, Hongshanosaurus houi, which was found in the same beds. It is potentially synonymous with H. houi; Sereno (2010), who proposed that Hongshanosaurus is a synonym of Psittacosaurus, opted to leave P. lujiatunensis and H. houi separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter's type specimen. One nearly complete skeleton of P. lujiatunensis from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species, Psittacosaurus major, named for the large size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two colleagues in 2007. You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from P. lujiatunensis. P. major was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull, which was 39% of the length of its torso, compared to 30% in P. mongoliensis, and other features. However, a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between P. lujiatunensis and P. major were due to differences in preservation and crushing. The study concluded that both represented a single species.|$|E

25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. <b>This</b> <b>bed</b> material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E

On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity.

In 1857, John Marley, in {{his account of the}} Cleveland Ironstone, described the Bell Ironworks as follows:These iron-works, situate on the Tyne, and belonging to Messrs.

500|$|The Phra Thinang Chakraphat Phiman ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{situated}} behind the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall {{and is at}} the very centre of the Maha Monthien buildings. The hall was built during the reign of King Rama I as the primary apartment and sleeping quarter of the monarch, and is the inner most part of the Grand Palace. The residential hall was formed out of three identical rectangular buildings, all inter-connected to each other. The middle section of the residential hall (out of the three), is a reception room while the other two sections, to the east and west, are divided into the personal apartments of the king. The east section is the primary bedchamber of the monarch; the hall is divided into two rooms by a golden screen. The northern room contains a canopied bed originally belonging to King Rama I; above <b>this</b> <b>bed</b> hangs a Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella. The southern room contains the dressing and privy chamber, above which hangs another Nine-tiered Umbrella. The west section was used as a multi-purpose hall for minor ceremonies and audiences; however in the reign of King Rama III the hall was converted into a bedroom. After his death it became the storage place for the various weapons and accoutrements of the monarch. The Royal Regalia of Thailand is kept here.|$|E

The researchers took the average bone density of two excavations within H97-04, 1 individual per 3 square meters, and projected it over the 2,000 square meters of the H97-04 bonebed. They estimated that this core area preserved the remains of 667 centrosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|Two sowing {{methods are}} used for cumin, {{broadcasting}} and line sowing. For broadcast sowing, the field is divided into beds and the seeds are uniformly broadcast in <b>this</b> <b>bed.</b> Afterwards, they are covered with soil using a rake. For line sowing, shallow furrows are prepared with hooks {{at a distance of}} [...] The seeds are then placed in these furrows and covered with soil. Line sowing offers advantages for intercultural operations such as weeding, hoeing, or spraying. The recommended sowing depth is 1–2cm and the recommended sowing density is around 120 plants per square metre. The water requirements of cumin are lower than those of many other species. Despite this, cumin is often irrigated after sowing to be sure that enough moisture is available for seedling development. The amount and frequency of irrigation depends on the climate conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The Qomolangma Formation, {{also known}} as the Jolmo Lungama Formation or the Everest Formation, runs from the summit {{to the top of the}} Yellow Band, about [...] above sea level. It {{consists}} of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone inter layered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone. Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is [...] thick comprises the foot of the [...] "Third Step", and base of the summit-pyramid of Everest. <b>This</b> <b>bed,</b> which crops out starting about [...] below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters.

This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.|$|E
