40|$|It {{has been}} empirically {{observed}} in both experiments and particle-in-cell simulations that space-charge-dominated beams suffer strong growth in statistical phase-space area (degraded quality) and particle losses in alternating gradient quadrupole transport channels when the undepressed phase advance {sigma}{sub 0 } increases beyond about 85 {sup o} per lattice period. Although this criterion {{has been used}} extensively in practical designs of strong focusing intense beam <b>transport</b> <b>lattices,</b> {{the origin of the}} limit has not been understood. We propose a mechanism for the transport limit resulting from classes of halo particle resonances near the core of the beam that allow near-edge particles to rapidly increase in oscillation amplitude when the space-charge intensity and the utter of the matched beam envelope are both sufficiently large. When coupled with a diffuse beam edge and/or perturbations internal to the beam core that can drive particles outside the edge, this mechanism can result in large and rapid halo-driven increases in the statistical phase-space area of the beam, lost particles, and degraded transport. A core-particle model is applied to parametrically analyze his process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a 3 D {{lattice model}} is {{proposed}} {{as a tool}} to simulate chloride diffusion in (cracked) cement based materials. The procedure consists of two (computationally independent) steps: simulating fracture with the fracture lattice model, previously developed, and simulating chloride diffusion process using the newly developed <b>transport</b> <b>lattice</b> model. Essentially, the output of the first step is used as an input for the second. In this manner, coupling between the mechanics and the transport simulation is achieved. In the paper, basic proce-dures for both steps are outlined, with the emphasis on the chloride transport simulation. Chloride penetration is assumed to be driven only by the diffusion process, while other mechanisms are neglected. Diffusion coefficient of chloride through the cracks is assumed to depend on the crack width, using relationships available in the literature. This study should provide more insight to the process of chloride penetration in cracked concrete, and allow quantification of the influ-ence of cracking on the process. 1...|$|E

Here we employ the KV envelope equations to analyze the linear stability properties of so-called mismatch perturbations about the matched (i. e., periodic) beam envelope in continuous focusing, periodic solenoidal, and periodic quadrupole <b>transport</b> <b>lattices</b> for a coasting beam. The formulation is analyzed and explicit self-consistent KV distributions are derived for an elliptical beam envelope in a periodic solenoidal transport channel. This derivation extends previous work to identify emittance measures and Larmor-frame transformations to allow application of standard form envelope equations to solenoidal focusing channels. Perturbed envelope equations are derived that include driving sources of mismatch excitation resulting from focusing errors, particle loss, and beam emittance growth. These equations are solved analytically for continuous focusing and demonstrate a factor of 2 increase in maximum mismatch excursions resulting from sudden driving perturbations relative to adiabatic driving perturbations. Numerical and analytical studies are carried out to explore properties of normal mode envelope oscillations without driving excitations in periodic solenoidal and quadrupole focusing lattices.
