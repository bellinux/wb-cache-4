5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} related generally <b>to</b> <b>severing</b> materials, {{and more}} particularly <b>to</b> <b>severing</b> or weakening materials through explosively induced, augmented shock waves. Explosive cords {{are placed in}} grooves on the upper surface of the material <b>to</b> be <b>severed</b> or weakened. The explosive cords are initiated simultaneously to introduce explosive shock waves into the material. These shock waves progress toward the centerline between the explosive cords and the lower surface of the material. Intersecting and reflected waves produce a rarefaction zone on the centerline to fail the material in tension. A groove may also be cut in the lower surface of the material <b>to</b> aid in <b>severing</b> or weakening the material...|$|R

5|$|Spain {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{threatening}} power for Japan at that time (with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines). Hasekura's eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in Nueva España (Mexico) may have precipitated the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada's decision <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.|$|E

The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 1996 CMLL {{took the}} CMLL World Women's Championship away from then reigning {{champion}} Reina Jubuki {{because she had}} wrestled on a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show in North America {{only a few days}} prior.

CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion only 2 days after announcing the title being vacated, choosing four of their top female competitors for a quick four-woman tournament.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, 1861, 63 delegates {{representing}} 34 counties met at Russellville {{to discuss}} {{the formation of a}} Confederate government for the Commonwealth. Despite its defeats at the polls, this group believed that the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens. Trigg County's Henry Burnett was elected chairman of the proceedings. Scott County farmer George W. Johnson chaired the committee that wrote the convention's final report and introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> ties with the Federal government. Both Breckinridge and Johnson served on the Committee of Ten that arranged the convention.|$|E

Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions.

Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made arrangements for the convention.|$|E
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E

5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs {{in parts of the}} body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|After a {{nighttime}} rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works {{of one of}} the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire to send in the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> its relationship with the American Federation of Labor and to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the American labor movement to this day.|$|E

To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used <b>to</b> <b>sever</b> his own foot out the door, and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
