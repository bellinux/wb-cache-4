40|$|Abstract Using {{macroeconomic}} {{factors to}} forecast <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> {{is an important}} means of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> forecasting, {{and it is also}} a challenging issue in China to which State Administration of Taxation pays close attention. As a prerequisite, the relationships among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and certain macroeconomic factors should be examined. In this paper, interactions among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue,</b> GDP, price level, and external trade in China are investigated. With the benefit of cointegration analysis, the long-run equilibrium conditions among <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and these macroeconomic factors are proposed. Based on these cointegrating relations, a vector error correction (VEC) model is then estimated. The results show both long-run and short-run relationships among total <b>tax</b> <b>revenue,</b> GDP, price level, and external trade in China, which could help to promote further studies concerning <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> analysis and forecasting using macroeconomic factors...|$|R
40|$|Figures for {{forecasts}} of future <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> are important reference materials when studying fiscal reconstruction. Forecasts of tax income {{by the government}} have been conducted on the assumption of an elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> of 1. 1 under a growth rate determined exogenously. This 1. 1 value for the elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> has been assumed from the past relationship between <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and GDP. The aim {{of this paper is}} to verify the validity of this assumption of the elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> and to study more precise methods for forecasting <b>tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> For that purpose, in this paper we estimate the <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> function using the past <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> structure with regard to the main categories of national and local taxes. When estimating the <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> function, as explanatory variables we employ tax system variables such as the taxation base for each tax category, their proxy variables, and tax rates. However, with regard to income tax and individual inhabitant tax we use the results of forecasts derived from a simulation model that uses the income distribution and <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> structure of a benchmark year. As a result of the simulation in this paper we obtain a figure of 1. 07 for the elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> for aggregate <b>tax</b> <b>revenue,</b> of 1. 154 for national tax, and of 0. 942 for local tax. It can be seen from this that the elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> of 1. 1 used by the government for long-term forecasting does not differ significantly from the result of accumulating individual revenue forecasts, though we also identify the existence of a disparity in elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> between national and local taxes. The reason for the higher elasticity in the case of national taxes is that the elasticity of <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> from income <b>tax</b> is 1. 791, which is higher than the corresponding figure of 1. 024 in the case of inhabitant tax. In addition, we show that the change to proportional tax rates in local taxes resulting from the so-called trinity reform of the national and local government administrative and fiscal system in Japan has served to widen the disparities between these <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> elasticities even further. we demonstrate that the conventional government long-term <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> forecasts based on the assumption of a 1. 1 <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> elasticity do not give rise to a particularly large difference from the estimate in this paper with regard to <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> as a whole, but they cause underestimation in the case of national tax, and overestimation in the case of local tax. ...|$|R

Although <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> {{has been a}} main source, in the implementation there are several problems are tax ratio and tax buoyancy low, the number of realized <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> are smaller than the target, the fall in the percentage realized <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> to target and low awareness of paying taxes.

40|$|State {{and local}} {{government}} <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> dropped steeply following the most severe housing market contraction since the Great Depression. We identify five main channels through which the housing market affects state and local tax revenues: property <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> transfer <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> personal income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> direct sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> (through construction materials) and indirect sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> (through the link between housing wealth and consumption). We find that historically property <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> do not tend to decrease following house price declines. Similarly, property tax collections have yet to fall on average during the current housing market contraction. On the basis of state-level case studies we conclude that the current resilience of property tax receipts is due to significant lags between market and assessed values and the tendency of policy makers offset declines in the tax base with higher tax rates. The other four channels have had a relatively modest effect on state <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> We calculate that the combined channels reduced <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> by $ 14 billion from 2005 to 2009, which is less than 2 percent of total state own-source revenues in 2005.

40|$|This study investigates why {{countries}} mandate accruals in {{the definition}} of corporate taxable income. Accruals alleviate timing and matching problems in cash flows, which smoothes taxable income and thus better aligns it with underlying economic performance.

We argue that accruals shape the distribution of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> which leads regulators to incorporate accruals into the definition of taxable income to balance the portfolio of government revenues and expenditures. Using a sample of 26 OECD countries, we find support for several theoretically motivated factors explaining the use of accruals in tax codes. We first provide evidence that corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> are less volatile in high accrual countries, but high accrual countries collect relatively higher (lower) <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> when the corporate sector grows (contracts).
