5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

The Rohan designs were based on Germanic and Anglo-Saxon patterns. Most of the weapons were designed by John Howe, and forged by Peter Lyon. Each sword took 3–6 days to make.|$|E

25|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{has been}} the most popular and widely read Purana texts {{relating}} to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages. Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> have won a war between the benevolent devas (deities) and evil asuras (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends. The Bhagavata Purana is a revered text in Vaishnavism. The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the Sattriya, Manipuri dance, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Bhagavata Mela and Mohiniyattam.|$|E
25|$|The Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian {{account of}} {{creation}} {{completed in the}} 12th century has {{much to say about}} Ahriman and his role in the cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the yazads on one side and Ahriman with his devs on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation.

All of his friends have also become W employees, hoping to reform the organization from within under Angel's supervision. Angel's life this season is complicated by the increasingly blurred line between good and evil, the deaths of loved ones Cordelia and Fred (Amy Acker), and the possibility that the Shanshu prophecy may in fact be referring to Spike (who is now also a vampire with a soul) and not Angel. Allowing his friends to believe he is being corrupted, Angel secretly plots to bring down the Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart by assassinating the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Partners' primary agents on Earth, even signing away his prophesied humanity in the process to convince them of his complex deception.

500|$|The {{title of}} the film refers to a video game character, [...] "The Chumscrubber", who helps his friends {{to survive in a}} {{superficial}} world by keeping things authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells [...] "Kill him!

Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming".

500|$|The first notable {{person to}} be fascinated with the {{supposed}} prophecy of the Fourth Eclogue and its potential references to Jesus was Constantine the Great, Roman emperor from AD 306 to 337, and he used part of it in an address he gave to the [...] "Assembly of the Saints", which was preserved by the Roman historian Eusebius in his work Vita Constantini. Constantine interpreted the entire work himself although he omitted a few lines that overtly reference paganism, such as {{the last part of}} line 10, which names Apollo. Constantine assigned the roles of the virgo in line 6 to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the puer in lines 8, 18, 60, and 62 is Christ, the lions in line 22 to the persecutors of Christians, and the serpent in line 24 to the Serpent of Evil. Constantine argued that the Assyrian flower in line 25 represented the race of people, i.e. the Assyrians, who were [...] "leader in the faith of Christ", and that references in line 30 meant that [...] "those who had borne hardships for the sake of God would perceive that the fruit of their endurance was sweet." [...] The emperor also interpreted the reference to Achilles fighting against Troy in lines 34-36 as a reference to Christ (the [...] "new" [...] Achilles) waging a war against <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> (the [...] "new" [...] Troy). Finally, Constantine proposed that the references to the Golden Age in lines 37-59 do not refer the birth of a mortal child, but rather a being who [...] "mortal parents have not smiled upon": in other words, Jesus Christ, who, according to Christian scripture, [...] "had no parents in the usual sense".|$|E
