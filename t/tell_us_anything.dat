All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E

CBI is chosen by countries under specific circumstances, which are related to their legal, political, and economic systems.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the problem of the genealogical {{connections}} of Galaktion Vologodsky, who was killed at some point between September 22 and September 25, 1612. The text of the Life of Galaktion <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that he was from the noble family of the Belsky princes. According to I. Veruzsky and others, the father of the saint was Ivan Fedorovich, who was killed at Shuisky’s order in 1542. Neither the Book of Degrees nor the Velvet Book <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> about Ivan Fedorovich’s children—but neither of these books is completely reliable. According to the text of the Life of Galaktion, his father was put to death at the order of the tsar but not a word is said about Shuisky’s involvement. Galaktion may in fact be the son of Ivan Dmitrievich Belsky (? – 1571) but he was not registered in the Book of Degrees because he was only an infant {{at the time of its}} compilation. As we know, Galaktion, who, after his father’s death, was hidden in Staritsa when he was seven years old, received no outside support; this may be explained by the circumstances experienced by Prince Ivan Dmitrievich’s family at this time. Prince Ivan’s sister Evdokiya, her husband (the boyar Morozov), and their two sons were all executed and were thus unable to help Galaktion. In the Life of Galaktion, written twenty years after his death, there is no accurate information about his family, but the hypothesis presented here is supported by the existing sources...|$|R

40|$|We have {{an ongoing}} {{interest}} in the large-scale analysis of consumer-generated media, of which weblogs are currently of special concern. In this position paper, we describe how our data gathering and analysis system, called T 2 ™, {{is being used to}} collect weblog entries and analyze them for reactions to issues and events in the commercial and government arenas. The paper includes preliminary lessons learned in trying to apply our sentiment analysis techniques to the highly informal language usage found in weblogs. Operational Motivation The blogging phenomenon is now well documented, with Technorati, for example, reporting that “the blogosphere continues to double every 5. 5 months, ” and that they are “tracking about 900, 000 blog posts created every day. ” This outpouring of commentary on anything and everything of interest to individual consumers adds yet another dimension to the set of large scale “conversations” that the Internet supports. The challenge is to see whether this on-line material <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> of value about the reactions that consumers have to issues and events. In particular, whether weblogs provide us with market indicators that can enhance and complement more traditional marketing research techniques. As in our previous work (Tong and Yager, 2004), we are primarily concerned with large-scale behaviors rather than analysis of any specific posting, and with the general sentiment expressed rather than the raw mentions of topics. This kind of analysis is of potential value in both commercial and government sectors. It can be used to gauge reaction to new products, or assess the impact of an advertising campaign, as well as to track attitudes towards US foreign policy, or understand the sentiment “on the street. ...|$|R

40|$|Savage et al. {{describe}} {{two different}} kinds of invariant. The kind they claim to have the greatest biological importance allows the invariant quantities to vary widely, even randomly, between different species. We do not agree that such quantities reveal any deep constraints on evolution. The purpose of our study (1) wastoshow that the usual technique of identifying invariants does not work. This technique involves regressing logged variables against each other {{and looking for a}} slope of 1 and, as a bonus, observing a high R 2 (2). Savage et al. (3) distinguish between two types of invariant. In type A invariance, two variables, X and Y, such as weaning weight and adult weight, have a ratio X/Y that does not vary systematically, e. g., as a function of adult weight. Such invariance is easy to discover. Simply find two variables, one of which is some random fraction of the other, and divide the two. Note that for type A, Binvariance [does not mean invariable: The ratio may be extremely different for different species. Savage et al. observe that our analysis assumed that the data satisfied type A invariance. This is certainly true, and we do not find it remarkable that a variable such as weaning weight might be a random multiple of adult body weight and do not think that this fact <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> deep about the world. It is also clear that the log-log regression analyses are appropriate for identifying type A invariants. In type B invariance, the ratio of the two variables is tightly constrained and, as noted by Savage et al., it does not change. We woul...|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} a proper name {{is not the same}} as the object (if there is any) it refers to. Hence, though [...] "Pegasus" [...] refers to nothing, it still has a meaning. The German philosopher Gottlob Frege seems to have held a theory of this sort. He says that the {{sentence}} [...] "Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep" [...] obviously has a sense. ... the thought by that sentence remains the same whether [...] "Odysseus" [...] has reference or not." [...] Bertrand Russell may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised definite description that signifies some unique characteristic. If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent. Otherwise it is empty. Perhaps [...] "Aristotle" [...] means [...] "the teacher of Alexander". Since there was such a person, [...] "Aristotle" [...] refers to that person. By contrast, [...] "Pegasus" [...] may mean [...] "the winged horse of Bellerophon". Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent. This is the so-called description theory of names. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature. So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander. But if [...] "Aristotle" [...] means [...] "teacher of Alexander", it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. Saul Kripke proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means. The sole information carried by the name seems to be the identity of the individual that it belongs to. This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual. As John Stuart Mill argued, a proper name <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> the identity of its bearer, without <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>anything</b> else about it. Naming is rather like pointing.|$|R

Second, what can the history of internet activism and social protest in Malaysia <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> if <b>anything,</b> about the 2011 global wave of protests?
