The {{earliest}} fossil specimens of V.vulpes were uncovered in Baranya, Hungary dating from 3.4-1.8million years ago. The ancestral species was likely smaller than the current one, as the earliest red fox fossils are smaller than modern populations. The earliest fossil remains of the modern species {{date back to the}} mid-Pleistocene in association with <b>the</b> <b>refuse</b> of early human settlements. This has led to the theory that the red fox was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{migration}} of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used <b>the</b> <b>refuse,</b> after drying it, {{as a source of}} energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with {{the migration}} of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen. Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect <b>the</b> <b>refuse</b> themselves using their own donkey carts.|$|E

However, Dilshan denied these rumors. On 25 August 2016, Dilshan announced his retirement from international arena after the Australian tour.

25|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority. Unlike other waste disposal authorities in Greater London, Croydon's rubbish is collected independently and isn't part of a waste authority unit. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill {{in the south of}} Croydon. There have recently been calls by the ODPM to bring waste management powers to the Greater London Authority, giving it a waste function. The Mayor of London has made repeated attempts to bring the different waste authorities together, to form a single waste authority in London. This has faced significant opposition from existing authorities. However, it has had significant support from all other sectors and the surrounding regions managing most of London's waste. Croydon has the joint best recycling rate in London, at 36%, but <b>the</b> <b>refuse</b> collectors have been criticised for their rushed performance lacking quality. Croydon's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is EDF Energy Networks; there are no power stations in the borough. Thames Water manages Croydon's drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including Beckton and King George VI. Before 1971, Croydon Corporation was responsible for water treatment in the borough.|$|E
25|$|Second, the Zabbaleen are {{the group}} that {{actually}} collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, {{an important component of}} their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries. Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo’s municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize <b>the</b> <b>refuse</b> collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.|$|E

By 1912, only around 2,000 inhabitants remained compared to the 30,000 of the boom years and the site was becoming a ghost town. By 1972, 500 people were living in Dawson whereas the nearby settlements created during the gold rush had been entirely abandoned.

2500|$|Citing {{other law}} cases, the judge {{dismantled}} the Richards' arguments. Part of the rationale {{was that the}} original owners of Richards' mill started the operation with one saw.

The addition of the number of saws and other pieces of equipment enabled an obvious increase in pollution, which the court argued, surpassed Richards' rights.
