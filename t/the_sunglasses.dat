Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals <b>the</b> <b>sunglasses,</b> allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre {{in a game of}} baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, hallucinogenically tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.|$|E

500|$|Chao is seen {{in almost}} every video as {{sporting}} a pair of sunglasses, a habit which kindled viewer interest. Tong attributes <b>the</b> <b>sunglasses</b> as contributing to Chao's [...] "cool factor".

Chao also parodies popular songs, such as the Justin Bieber hits [...] "As Long as You Love Me" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend", as well as criticizing and poking fun at other people, usually with profane language. Fans of Chao {{are referred to as}} [...] "Chao Nation". Beth Hong of The Vancouver Observer writes that Chao {{is an example of a}} [...] "FOB" [...] or a [...] "Honger". Tong– speaking in character– refutes this, stating that [...] "a FOB is a fresh-off-the-boat immigrant that come [...] all the way from China to study in North America. Don't look at me, I'm not a FOB. I'm Peter Chao. FOBs can't speak a lick of English." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with <b>the</b> <b>sunglasses</b> is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E
500|$|The {{rush for}} Madonna's fashion {{started with the}} music video for [...] "Lucky Star". In the video, Madonna wore an all-black outfit with leggings, ankle boots, and belly button, with her tangled hair tied in a floppy black ribbon. This was coupled with a shiny black miniskirt, an earring on her right ear, cut-off gloves and rubber bangles. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was {{credited}} with designing the outfit, although biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was after all wearing her day-to-day outfit. Mary Lambert, then a Rhode Island School of Design graduate, was decided for directing the video. However, Arthur Pierson replaced her as the director. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a small budget to make the video, shot in an afternoon. Madonna's brother, Christopher Ciccone, is a back-up dancer in the video. In his book Life with My Sister Madonna he says that although he was only paid $200 to dance in the video, {{at the time he}} was [...] "just happy to be part of it." [...] The video starts with the close-up of Madonna's face, as she slides her sunglasses down her nose. This scene was a reference to the character of Lolita in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of the same name, and Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). The image then fades to white, denoting the celestial stars dazzle, and then resumes itself in color. Madonna is shown dancing against a stark white background, along with closeups of her mesmerised gaze. She is accompanied by Belle and brother Christopher, as backup dancers. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on <b>the</b> <b>sunglasses.</b> The taking down and putting up of those sunglasses provided a frame to contain the song, functioning like a curtain that marks the opening and closing of a stage performance.|$|E

2500|$|Wayfarers were {{designed}} in 1952 by American optical designer Raymond Stegeman, {{who worked for}} Bausch and Lomb, Ray-Ban's parent company at that time. The design was inspired by, [...] "a mid-century classic to rival Eames chairs and Cadillac tail fins." [...] According to design critic Stephen Bayley, the [...] "distinctive trapezoidal frame spoke a non-verbal language that hinted at unstable dangerousness, but one nicely tempered by the sturdy arms which, according to the advertising, gave the frames a 'masculine look.'" [...] <b>The</b> <b>sunglasses</b> also featured a new plastic molding technology.|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated.

The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
