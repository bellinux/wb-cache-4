[...] John slid off and waved a hand at the {{drooping}} beast, then began <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> him. [...] "Wal, he done great. We bogged some comin' over. An' I climbed the pass at night on the frozen snow." ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{speaking}} {{a word to}} him, the men led their horses through to the inner cave, and then threw themselves down by the fire. Jim at once proceeded <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> the horses, and rub them down; keeping an ear open, all the time, to {{what was being said}} by the bush rangers. Their remarks however were, for a time, confined to terrible curses as to their luck.|$|E
50|$|Grundy's winning time of 2:26.98 {{broke the}} race record by almost {{two and a}} half seconds, the record stood until 2010 when Harbinger ran 2:26.78 over a {{slightly}} modified course. As sometimes happens, a race of this nature took a toll on both horses. Bustino and Grundy appeared totally exhausted as they returned <b>to</b> the <b>unsaddling</b> enclosure. Bustino never raced again.|$|R
60|$|The knight {{shrugged his}} shoulders, {{and leaving the}} hut, brought in his horse, (which in the interim he had {{fastened}} <b>to</b> a tree,) <b>unsaddled</b> him with much attention, and spread upon the steed's weary back his own mantle.|$|R
60|$|Would {{anything}} more happen? Would our sheikh play us false? It {{was a moment}} of breathlessness. We crouched and cowered in the shade, holding our hearts with fear, while the Arab drivers pretended <b>to</b> be <b>unsaddling</b> the camels. A minute or two of anxious suspense; then, peering over our beasts' backs, we saw their long line filing off towards the oasis. We watched their turbaned heads, silhouetted against the sky, disappear slowly. One by one they faded away. The danger was past. With beating hearts we rose up again.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll camp {{here for}} an hour or two," [...] he said sharply, leaping from his horse, which he {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle.</b> [...] "Hallo! somebody's bin here before us. Their fire ain't cold yet. Well, it don't matter. Get the grub ready, boys, an' boil the kettle. My head is all but split. If ever I have the luck to come across that Irish blackguard Brixton I'll--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He began <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle,</b> and the Marquis, {{restored}} to equanimity, followed his example. Rolling up his sleeves, Miss Sally sprang for the grub wagon, shouting: [...] "I'm the new cook b'thunder! Some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire, and I'll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes." [...] Miss Sally's energy and good-humor, as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee, flour, and bacon, won the good {{opinion of the}} camp instantly.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Pierre <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> and {{rub down}} his horse, Philip {{walked to the}} farther edge of the wood, to view the country beyond. They were, he knew, not far from La Chatre; {{and he was not}} {{surprised}} to see the town, lying in a valley, to which the ground sloped down from the wood. It was about {{a mile and a half}} distant. Nearer the wood, but half a mile to the west, the towers of a fortified chateau rose from a clump of trees. The country was rich and well cultivated, and everything had an aspect of peace and comfort.|$|E
60|$|The joy in {{our hearts}} at our {{deliverance}} was poisoned; well-nigh dissipated, indeed. We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and sullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at everything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and in unsociable single file plowed our way <b>to</b> the horses, <b>unsaddled</b> them, and sought shelter in the station.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of her hock injury, it was decided to give Noblesse a couple of months rest before {{preparing}} her for a tilt at Europe's richest race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. Her preparatory race was to be the Prix Vermeille which is run over the same course and distance as the 'Arc'. Ridden by Lester Piggott in the 'Vermeille', Noblesse started a short-priced favourite but was beaten into third place and returned lame <b>to</b> the <b>unsaddling</b> enclosure. Since very little time remained to get her back fit and ready to run in the 'Arc', she was retired. Noblesse was named Champion three-year-old filly for 1963. Timeform summed her career up as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Once again {{sent off}} as short-priced {{favourite}} for the 2010 Cheltenham Gold Cup, Kauto Star was strongly fancied {{to win it}} for the third time. He spent {{the early part of}} the race travelling well and at the seventh fence went into second place. He looked to put in an equally big jump at the eighth fence before seeming to change his mind just after take off and crashed through the fence. This knocked him back to fifth place and despite getting back into contention, he never recovered the fluidity of earlier in the race. At the fourth-to-last fence, known as the downhill fence, and when in fifth place, Kauto Star fell awkwardly, landing on his neck. However, he got to his feet, apparently unscathed. The race was won by the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Imperial Commander, with Denman in second and Mon Mome in third place. Unusually for a non-finisher, Kauto Star was applauded by those in the grandstands as he returned <b>to</b> the <b>unsaddling</b> area.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the horses}} were detrained and the baggage packed, the little party mounted and left the station, and {{choosing}} a piece of unoccupied ground {{a few hundred yards}} away, proceeded <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> and picket the horses, while Chris rode away to the camp accompanied by one of the natives to hold his horse there. He had no difficulty in finding it, and dismounting, walked to the group of head-quarter tents. His appearance excited a good deal of amusement and some chaff from the soldiers he passed. He looked, indeed, like a young Dutch farmer in his rough clothes, and his rifle, and a bandolier of cartridges. Seeing a young officer close to a tent, he asked him which was that of the adjutant- general.|$|E
6000|$|... "This it {{said and}} vanished. I lifted my whip, but needed not to strike my horse, for not {{a bird that}} has wings could fly faster than he now flew with me on his back. No path was before me, nor did I know where we were going. Through rushes and through thickets, over burrows of wild animals, stones, rivers, marshes, we flew {{as if all the}} devils that are on the earth and under it were at our heels; and when the horse stopped it was at my own door. I stayed not <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> him, but, cutting the {{surcingle}} with my knife, left him to shake the saddle off; then with the bridle I hammered on the door, shouting to my wife to open. I heard her fumbling for the tinder-box. 'For the love of Heaven, woman, strike no light,' I cried. 'Santa Barbara bendita! have you seen a ghost?' she exclaimed, opening to me. 'Yes,' I replied, rushing in and bolting the door, 'and had you struck a light you would now have been a widow.' ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there is}} a great {{clapping}} of hands, and looking up you find the president has come; he is supported by two friends, and all three, with comic solemnity, wear tall hats and frock coats. They bow to the public. Bull-fighting is the only punctual thing in Spain, and the president arrives precisely as the clock strikes half-past four. He waves a handkerchief, the band strikes up, a door is opened, and the fighters enter. First come the three matadors, the eldest in the middle, the next on his right, and the youngest on the left; they are followed by their respective cuadrillas, the banderilleros, the capeadors, the picadors on horseback, and finally the chulos, whose duty it is <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> dead horses, attach the slaughtered bull to the team of mules, and perform other minor offices. They advance, gorgeous in their coloured satin and gold embroidery, bearing a cloak peculiarly folded over the arm; they walk with a kind of swinging motion, as ordained by the convention of a century. They bow to the president, very solemnly. The applause is renewed. They retire to the side, three picadors take up their places at some distance from one another on the right of the door from which issues the bull. The alguaciles, in black velvet, with peaked and feathered hats, on horseback, come forward, and the key of the bull's den is thrown to them. They disappear. The fighters meanwhile exchange their satin cloaks for others of less value. There is another flourish of trumpets, the gates are opened for the bull.|$|E
50|$|The {{final day}} of the 1985 season was at Doncaster and this was to be Mercer’s {{farewell}} to UK flat racing. Although he had a few rides his best chance of a win was presented to him by Jeremy Hindley and Michael Hills. Hills was to ride the favourite in a two-year-old race called Comme l’Etoile for his stable, but elected to step aside so Mercer could have a chance of riding a final winner for a stable he’d been long associated with. Mercer duly won on Comme l’Etoile and this seemed a perfect ending. Except that later on the card he rode a relatively unfancied colt called Bold Rex in the Manchester November Handicap. In very soft going Mercer kept this John Dunlop trained colt towards the rear but steered him up the centre of the course to win a final big victory. The horse and jockey were cheered loudly {{all the way from the}} course <b>to</b> the <b>unsaddling</b> enclosure.|$|R
60|$|To {{pour the}} charge of small shot down into {{the centre of the}} flying mass was the work of a moment; <b>to</b> mount his <b>unsaddled</b> charger, and dash down the steep rugged path with a clatter equal to that of half a {{squadron}} of dragoons, was the work of two minutes more. To pull up suddenly, when he had terrified the spirits of the intruders wellnigh out of their bodies, return slowly to his rude domicile, reload his blunderbuss, and retire to rest with a grim smile on his bearded mouth, and a lurking expression of fun in his big blue eyes, as he drew his blanket over him, was the usual termination of such scenes.|$|R
60|$|We {{arrived here}} {{yesterday}} afternoon, after three days’ marching. On the 26th the troops went from Mai Dehar to Dongollo, fifteen miles; on the 27th to Agula, nine miles; {{and on the}} 28th to Doullo, fifteen miles. The road has lain across a much more undulating country than that over which we have previously passed. On the first day’s march we had one very long and steep descent. This tried the mules; and many were the upsets of packs, many the tired animals who lay down, and refused <b>to</b> move until <b>unsaddled,</b> upon the narrow ledge. Fortunately, however, although long and steep, it was straight, and so the artillery got down with comparative ease and without any accident. The camp was in a valley, where the water was very good, and where there was one pool of deep water nearly 200 yards long, which afforded excellent bathing. There were a good many fish in it, and several were caught of over a pound in weight. This is curious, as {{it shows that the}} Abyssinians are by no means skilful fishermen; for Mr. Speedy tells me that during his residence in the country he never saw nor heard of a fish more than three inches long being caught.|$|R
6000|$|At {{five o'clock}} {{we came to}} the end of the road. It led to a forest glade, {{overlooking}} the stream we had followed, and that was as far as our wagon could go. The glade shone red with sumach, and surrounded by tall pines, with a rocky and shady glen below, it appeared a delightful place to camp. As I was about <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> my horses I heard the cluck-cluck of turkeys. Pulling out my borrowed rifle, and calling Romer, I ran to the edge of the glade. The shady, swift stream ran fifty feet or so below me. Across it I saw into the woods where shade and gray rocks and colored brush mingled. Again I heard the turkeys cluck. [...] "Look hard, son," [...] I whispered. [...] "They're close." [...] R.C. came slipping along below us, with his rifle ready. Suddenly Romer stiffened, then pointed. [...] "There! Dad!--There!" [...] I saw two gobblers wade into the brook not more than a hundred and fifty feet away. Drawing down with fine aim I fired. The bullet splashed water all over the turkeys. One with loud whirr of wings flew away. The other leaped across the brook and ran--swift as a deer--right up the slope. As I tried to get the sight on him I heard other turkeys fly, and the crack-crack of R.C.'s gun. I shot twice at my running turkey, and all I did was to scatter the dirt over him, and make him run faster. R.C. had not done any better shooting. Romer, wonderful to relate, was so excited that he forgot to make fun of our marksmanship. We scouted around some, but the turkeys had gone. By promising to take Romer hunting after supper I contrived to get him back to the glade, where we made camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] and {{immediately}} stepping from the porch, gestured the cosmopolitan to a settee near by, on deck. [...] "There, sir, sit you there, and I will sit here beside you--you desire {{to hear of}} Colonel John Moredock. Well, a day in my boyhood is marked with a white stone--the day I saw the colonel's rifle, powder-horn attached, hanging in a cabin on the West bank of the Wabash river. I was going westward a long journey through the wilderness with my father. It was nigh noon, and we had stopped at the cabin <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> and bait. The man at the cabin pointed out the rifle, and told whose it was, adding that the colonel was that moment sleeping on wolf-skins in the corn-loft above, so we must not talk very loud, for the colonel had been out all night hunting (Indians, mind), {{and it would be}} cruel to disturb his sleep. Curious to see one so famous, we waited two hours over, in hopes he would come forth; but he did not. So, it being necessary to get to the next cabin before nightfall, we had at last to ride off without the wished-for satisfaction. Though, to tell the truth, I, for one, did not go away entirely ungratified, for, while my father was watering the horses, I slipped back into the cabin, and stepping a round or two up the ladder, pushed my head through the trap, and peered about. Not much light in the loft; but off, in the further corner, I saw what I took to be the wolf-skins, and on them a bundle of something, like a drift of leaves; and at one end, what seemed a moss-ball; and over it, deer-antlers branched; and close by, a small squirrel sprang out from a maple-bowl of nuts, brushed the moss-ball with his tail, through a hole, and vanished, squeaking. That bit of woodland scene was all I saw. No Colonel Moredock there, unless that moss-ball was his curly head, seen in the back view. I would have gone clear up, but the man below had warned me, that though, from his camping habits, the colonel could sleep through thunder, he was for the same cause amazing quick to waken at the sound of footsteps, however soft, and especially if human." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{left our}} miserable sleeping-place before sunrise. The road {{passed through a}} narrow sandy plain, lying between {{the sea and the}} {{interior}} salt lagoons. The number of beautiful fishing birds, such as egrets and cranes, and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical forms, gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have possessed. The few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants, among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideae were most to be admired. As the sun rose, the day became extremely hot, and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very distressing. We dined at Mandetiba; the thermometer in the shade being 84 degrees. The beautiful view of the distant wooded hills, reflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon, quite refreshed us. As the vênda here was a very good one, and I have the pleasant, but rare remembrance, of an excellent dinner, I will be grateful and presently describe it, as the type of its class. (2/1. Vênda, the Portuguese name for an inn.) These houses are often large, and are built of thick upright posts, with boughs interwoven, and afterwards plastered. They seldom have floors, and never glazed windows; but are generally pretty well roofed. Universally the front part is open, forming a kind of verandah, in which tables and benches are placed. The bedrooms join on each side, and here the passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can, on a wooden platform covered by a thin straw mat. The vênda stands in a courtyard, where the horses are fed. On first arriving, it was our custom <b>to</b> <b>unsaddle</b> the horses and give them their Indian corn; then, with a low bow, to ask the senhôr to do us the favour to give us something to eat. [...] "Anything you choose, sir," [...] was his usual answer. For the few first times, vainly I thanked providence for having guided us to so good a man. The conversation proceeding, the case universally became deplorable. [...] "Any fish can you do us the favour of giving ?"--"Oh no, sir."--"Any soup?"--"No, sir."--"Any bread?"--"Oh no, sir."--"Any dried meat?"--"Oh no, sir." [...] If we were lucky, by waiting a couple of hours, we obtained fowls, rice, and farinha. It not unfrequently happened that we were obliged to kill, with stones, the poultry for our own supper. When, thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger, we timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal, the pompous, and (though true) most unsatisfactory answer was, [...] "It will be ready when it is ready." [...] If we had dared to remonstrate any further, we should have been told to proceed on our journey, as being too impertinent. The hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners; their houses and their persons are often filthily dirty; the want of the accommodation of forks, knives, and spoons is common; and I am sure no cottage or hovel in England could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every comfort. At Campos Novos, however, we fared sumptuously; having rice and fowls, biscuit, wine, and spirits, for dinner; coffee in the evening, and fish with coffee for breakfast. All this, with good food for the horses, only cost 2 shillings 6 pence per head. Yet the host of this vênda, being asked if he knew anything of a whip which one of the party had lost, gruffly answered, [...] "How should I know? why did you not take care of it?--I suppose the dogs have eaten it." ...|$|E
60|$|The account {{given by}} Mr. Pleydell of his sitting {{down in the}} midst of a revel to draw an appeal case was taken from a story told me by an aged gentleman of the elder President Dundas of Amiston (father of the younger President and of Lord Melville). It had been thought very desirable, while that {{distinguished}} lawyer was king's counsel, that his assistance should be obtained in drawing an appeal case, which, as occasion for such writings then rarely occurred, was held to be matter of great nicety. The solicitor employed for the appellant, attended by my informant acting as his clerk, went to the Lord Advocate's chambers in the Fishmarket Close, as I think. It was Saturday at noon, the Court was just dismissed, the Lord Advocate had changed his dress and booted himself, and his servant and horses were at the foot of the close to carry him to Arniston. It was scarcely possible to get him to listen to a word respecting business. The wily agent, however, on pretence of asking one or two questions, which would not detain him half an hour, drew his Lordship, who was no less an eminent ban vivant than a lawyer of unequalled talent, to take a whet at a celebrated tavern, when the learned counsel became gradually involved in a spirited discussion of the law points of the case. At length it occurred to him that he might as well ride to Arniston in the cool of the evening. The horses were directed to be put in the stable, but not <b>to</b> be <b>unsaddled.</b> Dinner was ordered, the law was laid aside for a time, and the bottle circulated very freely. At nine o'clock at night, after he had been honouring Bacchus for so many hours, the Lord Advocate ordered his horses to be unsaddled; paper, pen, and ink were brought; he began to dictate the appeal case, and continued at his task till four o'clock the next morning. By next day's post the solicitor sent the case to London, a chef-d'oeuvre of its kind; and in which, my informant assured me, it was not necessary on revisal to correct five words. I am not, therefore, conscious of having overstepped accuracy in describing the manner in which Scottish lawyers of the old time occasionally united the worship of Bacchus with that of Themis. My informant was Alexander Keith, Esq., grandfather to my friend, the present Sir Alexander Keith of Ravelstone, and apprentice at the time to the writer who conducted the cause.|$|R
5000|$|Mongolian nomads {{have long}} been {{considered}} to {{be some of the}} best horsemen in the world. During the time of Genghis Khan, Mongol horse archers were capable of feats such as sliding down the side of their horse to shield their body from enemy arrows, while simultaneously holding their bow under the horse's chin and returning fire, all at full gallop. In 1934, Haslund described how a herdsman breaking in a semi-wild horse was able <b>to</b> ungirth and <b>unsaddle</b> his horse as it bucked underneath him. He wrote, [...] "It is a pleasure to see the Mongols in association with their horses, and to see them on horseback is a joy. ...The strength, swiftness and elegance of a Mongol surpass that of any ballet dancer." [...] This same skill in horsemanship held true in antiquity. Giovanni de Carpini, a Franciscan monk who visited Mongolia during the 1240s, observed that [...] "their children begin as soon as they are two or three years old to ride and manage horses and to gallop on them, and they are given bows to suit their stature and are taught to shoot; they are extremely agile and also intrepid. Young girls and women ride and gallop on horseback with agility like men." [...] Today as in the Middle Ages, the education of a modern Mongolian horseman begins in childhood. Parents will place their child on a horse and hold them there before the child can even hang on without assistance. By the age of 4, children are riding horses with their parents. [...] By age 6, children can ride in races; by age 10, they are learning to make their own tack.|$|R
