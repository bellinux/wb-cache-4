2500|$|The formal {{approach}} of English courts is that agreement exists when an offer is mirrored by an unequivocal {{acceptance of the}} terms on offer. Whether an offer has been made, or it has been accepted, is an issue courts determine by asking what a reasonable person would have thought was intended. Offers are distinguished from [...] "invitations to treat" [...] (or an invitatio ad offerendum, the invitation of an offer) which cannot be simply accepted by the other party. Traditionally, English law has viewed the display of goods in a shop, even with a price tag, as an invitation to treat, so that when a customer takes the product to the till it is she who is making the offer, and the shopkeeper may refuse to sell. Similarly, and as a very general rule, an advertisement, the invitation {{to make a bid}} at an auction with a reserve price, or the invitation <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> <b>tender</b> bid are not considered offers. On the other hand, a person inviting tenders may fall under a duty to consider the submissions if they arrive before the deadline, so the bidder (even though there is no contract) could sue for damages if his bid is never considered. An auctioneer who publicises an auction as being without a reserve price falls under a duty to accept the highest bid. An automated vending machine constitutes a standing offer, and a court may construe an advertisement, or something on display like a deckchair, to be a serious offer if a customer would be led to believe they were accepting its terms by performing an action. Statute imposes criminal penalties for businesses that engage in misleading advertising, or not selling products at the prices they display in store, or unlawfully discriminating against customers on grounds of race, gender, sexuality, disability, belief or age. The Principles of European Contract Law article 2:201 suggests that most EU member states count a proposal to supply any good or service by a professional as an offer.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the use of stochastic modelling as an approach to assessing the impact of uncertainty in effort and cost estimations in software projects. Uncertainty in input values is modelled using probability distributions and this uncertainty is propagated through the model to provide risk information using Monte Carlo simulation. Statistical analysis of the outputs of the simulation provides a means for identifying where the highest risk in the estimates lies. Understanding this risk, in terms of both its impact and its likelihood, allows activities to be undertaken to mitigate the risk prior <b>to</b> <b>submitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>tender,</b> therefore increasing the confidence with which the bid/no-bid decision is made...|$|R

Companies are invited through a contract notice or prior indicative notice to express interest in being invited to tender, and selected companies are then invited <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>tender.</b> Negotiations may take place between the contracting authority and each business in order to [...] "improve the content" [...] of each tender, before invitations are issued <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> final <b>tender.</b> Final tenders are then evaluated against the previously published award criteria and a contract awarded.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the decision a purchaser must make regarding the number of suppliers that should be invited <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> <b>tender</b> for a certain purchase.

On the other hand, with every additional tender, the purchaser might obtain a better bid. We present a theoretical decision model, the Economic Tender Quantity (ETQ) model, that under certain conditions may assist the purchaser in finding the number of tenderers that minimises the expected total costs of the tender process, that is the sum of the expected costs of sending, evaluating and communicating, and the expected bid price. We discuss these conditions and possible extensions, as well as future research opportunities in this area...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} tool for the {{discovery}} of business opportunities on the Web, more specifically to help a user find relevant call for tenders (CFT), i. e. invitations to contractors <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> <b>tender</b> for their products/services. Simple keyword-based Information Retrieval do not capture the relationships in the data, which are needed to answer the complex needs of the users. We therefore augment keywords with information extracted through natural language processing and business intelligence tools. As opposed to most systems, this information is used at all stages in the back-end and interface. The benefits are twofold: first we obtain higher precision of search and classification, and second the user gains access to a deeper level of information. Two challenges are: how to discover new CFT and related documents on the Web, and how to extract information from these documents, knowing that the Web offers no guarantee on the structure and stability of those documents. A major hurdle {{to the discovery of}} new documents is the poor degree of “linkedness ” between businesses, and the open topic area, which makes topic-focused Web crawling (Aggarwal et al., 2001) unapplicable. To extract information, wrappers (Soderland, 1999), i. e. tools that can recognise textual and/or structural patterns, have limited success because of the diversity and volatility of Web documents. Since we cannot assume a structure for documents, we exploit information usually contained in CFTs: contracting authority, opening/closing date, location, legal notices, conditions of submission, classification, etc. These can appear marked up with tags or as free-text. A first type of information to extract are the socalled named entities (Maynard et al., 2001), i. e...|$|E
40|$|Reproduced with {{permission}} of the publisher. © 2008 Cambridge University Press. When called upon to host a banquet celebrating the forthcoming Great Exhibition of 1851, the world's first display of international industry, the Mayor of York turned to the period's most renowned chef for the catering. The Frenchman Alexis Soyer, who had recently resigned from his position at the Reform Club in Pall Mall, had {{made a name for}} himself in Britain through a combination of extravagant culinary endeavours and popular household cookery books. The banquet at York was an important occasion; joining Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's Consort, was a long list of national luminaries from Victorian high society and the political world. Soyer did not disappoint the Mayor, or his guests. The Times commented that amongst the vast array of international cuisines on offer was featured “one dish, to which turtles, ortolans, and other rich denizens of land and sea had contributed, [which] cost not less than 100 l. ” The paper noted with satisfaction that the feast was consumed before an “emblematical device representing Britannia in her conventional attire receiving the industrial products of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America” (“The Banquet at York” 5). That this emblem provided the backdrop to such cosmopolitan fare was salient: it spoke to the way in which the production and consumption of food would become a crucial motif in the positive representation of globalisation as it was understood at the Exhibition; it also highlighted the important role that the Victorian metropolis would fulfil in the realisation of this new world order. Certainly, the internationalist bent of Soyer's cooking seemed entirely appropriate to the luminaries gathered at the York banquet, and it was no doubt with the French chef's culinary scope in their minds as well as their stomachs that the Exhibition's organisers invited Soyer <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>a</b> <b>tender</b> to provide refreshments at the display itself (Soyer 197) ...|$|E
