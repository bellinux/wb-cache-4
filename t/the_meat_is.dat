5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park.

5|$|Harmless to humans, the banded houndshark is {{commonly}} displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan, and has reproduced in captivity. Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years. This species is often caught incidentally off Japan in gillnets and set nets; <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes sold, but {{is considered to}} be of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in the region. It is caught in lesser numbers off Taiwan, and is probably also fished off Korea and northern China. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the banded houndshark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant throughout its range. Off Japan, it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization data available, though this species is certainly caught by commercial fisheries operating across many parts of its range. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> said to be of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk.

5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> in a state of extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important role in}} its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>meat</b> of sheep, {{which also}} {{includes}} the category of lamb <b>meat,</b> <b>is</b> used by consumers {{all over the world}} of all cultures and religions, even though a considerable number of people do not accept this type of meat because of its characteristic smell and taste. One of the factors that influence <b>the</b> acceptability of <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> products <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sensoric properties (appearance, taste and smell which all together make up the aroma, tenderness and juiciness, <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> texture) <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> of lambs of mixed breed, combined Svrljig and Pirot Pramenka, was used as the material in this experiment. The lambs were aged one, three and five months at the time of slaughter. They were fed in a combined manner: with milk, on pastures, and with the addition of concentrated feeds to their diet ration. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> heat processed in an oven at a temperature of 170 oC over a period of 60 minutes. Eight evaluators took part in the experiment. The quantitative descriptive analysis (ISO 6564 / 85) comprised structure scales of intensity with seven points, with the examination of smell intensity, tenderness, juiciness, intensity (fullness) of taste, acceptability of aroma, and total acceptability. Following thermic processing, the smell of <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most intense in <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> of lambs aged five months. <b>The</b> most tender <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> that originating from lambs aged three months, and <b>the</b> juiciest <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> that of lambs aged five months. According to the evaluators, <b>the</b> tastiest <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> that originating from lambs aged three months. The specific aroma of lamb <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> most expressed in <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> of lambs aged three months. Total acceptability, as a very complex property dependent on a series of factors, nuanced by a large number of volatile compounds which individually have a very low threshold of detection, but are observed together and in combination with the other organoleptic characteristics, was most favorably assessed in <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> of lambs aged three months...|$|R
50|$|Canadian {{barbecue}} {{takes many}} influences from its American neighbour, {{as well as}} from British, Central European, and Euro-Mediterranean barbecue styles.
