5|$|By early July the Chinese {{launched}} a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> and South Koreans subsequently {{responded with a}} series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the Chinese attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Porkchop Hill on the US I Corps right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although again without success. Following another Chinese assault on 9 July <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the Chinese {{launched a}} series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. Yet, with <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> unprepared to accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Porkchop Hill on 11 July.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose <b>the</b> <b>Americans.</b> After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had not yet heard that war had been declared.

5|$|During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell {{showed their}} {{intention}} to deny <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> the gold {{for the first time}} at Olympic level.

Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had more speed in reserve, having rested 200m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> could move to Berlin because <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> already on the Elbe River, were {{unlikely}} to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.|$|E

5|$|Patch {{initiated}} a new offensive {{just as the}} 38th Division began {{to withdraw from the}} inland ridges and hills that it had occupied. On 20 January, the 25th Infantry Division, under Major General J.

Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.|$|E

The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island.

5|$|The provincial forces began {{landing at}} Gabarus Bay on 30 April, and laid siege to the {{fortress}} while the British ships blockaded the harbour. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> began suffering battle losses, while the British naval officers, {{who had a}} low opinion of American soldiers, grew increasingly critical of the American efforts.

Louisbourg surrendered on 17 June. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> lost 180 men in combat, to disease or at sea during the siege, while the Royal Navy ships did not fire on the fortress, and lost just one sailor. As the victors settled into occupation of Louisbourg, friction grew between <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> and the British. The terms of surrender guaranteed the French in all of their possessions; there was no plunder for the American troops.
