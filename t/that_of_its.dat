5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as actions against piracy, this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The {{counter-argument}} is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and independent maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{a member}} of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. Its foreign policy closely follows <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers). Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, {{although}} military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Mauna Loa would have started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from the sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843.
