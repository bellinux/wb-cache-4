50|$|The {{tower was}} built in 1959 for {{broadcasting}} of radio and television programs. Felsenegg-Girstel was the number one national <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> for TV transmissions {{and it was the}} connection point of many private TV stations in Switzerland allowing to connect to the national and international TV net. The REAL system moves antennas on other 27 Swisscom-towers. Today, Felsenegg is getting a station like all the others, as the optical fiber technology will replace beam radio technology. Felsenegg still supplies directional radio but also FM broadcasting among them Radio Zürisee in Rapperswil. Since 2005, Skyguide maintains a radar station at the same location.|$|E

Taxis, learner vehicles and heavy transport vehicles must undergo an inspection every year. Inspection centers can be either public or private companies. Private vehicle <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> (P-VTCC or I-KTEO in Greek) had to be accredited according to ISO 17020 standard. This requirement changed and P-VTCCs must be certified according to ISO 9001:2008 standard.|$|R
50|$|As Calgary grew, the Calgary Power Company Ltd. grew, with hydro dams being {{developed}} {{up and down}} the Bow River. Seebe became the <b>technical</b> hub, remotely <b>controlling</b> water flow from the Spray, Ghost, Kananaskis, Lake Minewanka, Brazeau, North Saskatchewan, and other watersheds, so that power could be produced efficiently. The <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> also could bring on more power from the coal-fired plants in the Wabamun area, west of Edmonton. The <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> at Seebe also once was the operations hub, while the head office was in Calgary.|$|R
40|$|In 2003, CERN {{decided to}} build a unified <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> to replace four of its control rooms: the âﾜMeyrin Control Roomâ which {{controlled}} the PS complex, the âﾜPrevessin Control Roomâ (PCR) which controlled the SPS and until 2000 LEP, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> Room (TCR), and the Cryogenics Control Room (QCR). After first contemplating a possible implementation next to the âﾜGlobe of Science and Innovationâ, it was decided for budgetary reasons to build the new CERN <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> (CCC) on the same location as the PCR. This represented a 50 % saving in construction costs {{as most of the}} technical infrastructure (computer network, water, electricity, ventilation) was already in place, but added stringent time constraints: civil engineering could not begin before the SPS shutdown in November 2004, yet the room had to be ready for the accelerator operations to resume in March 2006. Although this presented a strict construction schedule, it allowed the project to be completely driven by the operational needs of CERN, and not by public relations activities...|$|R
