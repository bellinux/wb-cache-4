25|$|In the United States, {{competitive}} drifters {{are required}} to run US DOT-approved (road legal) tires similar to racing slicks in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, {{with the exception of}} some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift which only permits commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has come to the point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. It makes for a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT <b>treadwear</b> rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s.|$|E

Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and <b>treadwear</b> warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty—Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).

50|$|It {{is legal}} and {{permissible}} for a tire manufacturer {{to give a}} particular tire line a lower <b>treadwear</b> grade. For example, if the highest <b>treadwear</b> grade in a manufacturer's lineup is 600, then a tire line with a lower <b>treadwear</b> test result might receive a grade of 400, instead of the 480 it could possibly receive.|$|E
5000|$|Notice {{that the}} <b>treadwear</b> grade is a ratio {{and not a}} mileage. This is because {{multiple}} factors determine <b>treadwear</b> rates {{and most of them}} are a function of driving conditions and operating environment, and not the tire itself. As a result, actual tire wear will vary considerably within the same tire line. However, two tires with exactly the same compound should have a <b>treadwear</b> rating that varies in accordance with tread depth.|$|E
50|$|As Course Monitoring Tires {{have changed}}, their <b>treadwear</b> grades have changed to numbers {{considerably}} higher than 100. As a result, {{it would be}} incorrect {{to say that a}} tire with a <b>treadwear</b> grade of 200 gets twice the life of the Course Monitoring Tire.|$|E
50|$|The UTQG {{rating is}} made up of three components, <b>treadwear,</b> {{traction}} and temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>treadwear</b> rating or <b>treadwear</b> {{grade is}} how long the tire {{manufacturers}} expect the tire to last. A Course Monitoring Tire (the standard tire that a test tire will be compared to) has a rating of [...] "100". If a manufacturer assigns a <b>treadwear</b> rating of 200 to a new tire, they are indicating that they expect the new tire to have a useful lifespan that is 200% {{of the life of}} a Course Monitoring Tire. The [...] "test tires" [...] are all manufacturer-dependent. Brand A's rating of 500 is not necessarily going to offer drivers the same mileage rating as Brand B's tire of the same rating. The testing is non-regulated and can vary greatly. <b>Treadwear</b> ratings are only useful for comparing Brand A's entire lineup against itself.Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface. Government legal standards prescribe the minimum allowable tread depth for safe operation.|$|E

5000|$|A Union of Concerned Scientists {{newsletter}} says [...] "LRR tires also {{meet the}} same federal standards for <b>treadwear,</b> traction, and temperature resistance as regular tires." ...|$|E
50|$|Also, it {{is common}} for tires whose <b>treadwear</b> grade is of little {{commercial}} value, such as racing tires, to be assigned extremely low values - sometimes even zero.|$|E
50|$|A lower <b>treadwear</b> rating {{indicates}} a higher friction coefficient and thus provides a shorter braking distance. A softer, more sticky tire, wears off its material faster {{to provide this}} performance.|$|E
50|$|Tires are {{restricted}} to a UTQG <b>treadwear</b> rating of 180 or greater. Prior to July 2013, this value was 190. The change was made to allow for additional options in tire selection.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>treadwear</b> {{grade is}} a {{comparative}} rating {{based on the}} wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test track. A tire graded 200 would last twice as long on the government test course under specified test conditions as one graded 100. In theory, this means that a tire with a 200 grade will wear {{twice as long as}} a tire with a 100 grade. However, tire manufacturers are not under any obligation to grade a tire based on the test results, except to say that they cannot overstate the grade. This is enforced by NHTSA requiring documentation to justify any assignment of a grade on a tire, [...] "These <b>treadwear</b> grades are no guarantee of actual tire mileage; differences in driving habits, service practices, climate, and road characteristics will affect a tire's longevity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there is}} no tread pattern, slick tyre tread does not deform much under load. The reduced {{deformation}} allows the tyre to be constructed of softer compounds without excessive overheating and blistering. Modern day slick tyres have now developed particular performance qualities in a specific window of temperatures, becoming [...] "sticky" [...] when accumulating enough heat, and thus give much greater adhesion to the road surface, {{but it also has}} a lower <b>treadwear</b> rating; i.e. it wears out much more quickly than the harder rubber tyres used for driving on the streets. It is not uncommon for drivers in some auto sports to wear out multiple sets of tyres during a single day's driving.|$|E
50|$|Uniform Tire Quality Grading, {{commonly}} abbreviated as UTQG, is {{the term}} encompassing a set of standards for passenger car tires that measures a tire's <b>treadwear,</b> temperature resistance and traction. The UTQG {{was created by the}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1978, a branch of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). All tires manufactured for sale in the United States since March 31, 1979 are federally mandated to have the UTQG ratings on their sidewall as part of the DOT approval process, in which non-DOT approved tires are not legal for street use in the United States. It is {{not to be confused with}} the tire code, a supplemental and global standard measuring tire dimensions, load-bearing ability and maximum speed, maintained by tire industry trade organizations and the International Organization for Standardization.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} in cheater slick technology {{has affected the}} development of tyres for racing series other than drag racing as well. When other forms of auto racing similarly instituted classes which require DOT approved street tyres, some manufacturers similarly began to market tyres which superficially resembled their high performance street tyres, but with the least tread pattern permissible and with very soft, sticky rubber, intended specifically for competition because the soft tread would wear too quickly for street use. These became known, loosely, as R compound tyres. With additional years of progress, this class of tyre has in its turn followed its own line of development, {{to the point where}} they have little in common with true street tyres of the same brand. Ironically, this has led to new classes of racing which require not only DOT approval, but also a minimum <b>treadwear</b> rating, in an effort to eliminate the R compound tyres from competition and require [...] "true" [...] street tyres.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A set of <b>treadwear</b> data {{representing}} {{over eight}} million tire section-miles of road testing was fitted by a carefully constructed simple model involving only two carbon black properties as independent variables, plus test severity as a parameter. It is {{shown that the}} carbon black char-acteristics measured by two practical laboratory tests &mdash; surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) adsorption for accessible specific sur-face area and dibutylphthalate absorption on precompressed black for "structure " &mdash; can account for {{virtually all of the}} observed wear resistance variation among carbon blacks which is not obscured by random exper-imental error. This degree of success in correlating roadwear data using only a simple two-parameter description of morphology hinges on use of surface area and structure test methods relatively free of extraneous influences known to affect results obtained by the standard ASTM iodine number and DBP procedures. The weight of data on which the model is based renders predictions by means of the correlation more reliable than results of individual tire tests of conventional design. Potentially attractive economies in quality testing of carbon black are implied by the possibility of "instant " roadwear screening of carbon blacks from diverse sources...|$|E
