5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E

In the Netherlands, the law forbids companies to offer housing to their employees, because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> to prevent people who have just lost their job adding to their stressful situation by having to search for new housing. In Japan, many of the larger companies {{as well as some of}} the ministries still offer to their newly graduated freshmen a room in a dormitory. A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women).

2500|$|In the United States the use or {{denial of}} use of current {{military}} aircraft in films {{is determined by the}} U.S. military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the U.S. military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get U.S. military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, [...] "This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts.

In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about that will probably depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E

2500|$|When first {{ordering}} the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted {{that it was}} a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, {{it was part of a}} plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, [...] "We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life." [...] In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, [...] "The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork." [...] In another New york Times article, Audi writes, [...] "Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically." [...] According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, [...] "The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt." [...] In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, Marina of the Zabbaleen. Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: [...] "The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses." ...|$|E

Now, this Anti-Corn-Law League, which they established last year at Manchester, and which begins to be very busy, though nobody at present talks of it, is, in my mind, a movement which ought to be watched. I tell you what; it occurred to me more than once during that wondrous pageant, that we have just now been taking part in, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> better information than they have as to the state of the country, the real feelings and condition of the bulk of the population. We used to sneer at the Tories for their ignorance of these matters, but after all, we, like them, are mainly dependent on quarter sessions; on the judgment of a lord-lieutenant and the statistics of a bench of magistrates. It is true we have introduced into our subordinate administration at Whitehall some persons who have obtained the reputation of distinguished economists, and we allow them to guide us. But though ingenious men, no doubt, they are chiefly bankrupt tradesmen, who, not having been able to manage their own affairs, have taken upon themselves to advise on the conduct of the country--pedants and prigs at the best, and sometimes impostors. No; this won't do. It is useless to speak to the chief; I did about the Anti-Corn-Law League; he shrugged his shoulders and said it was a madness that would pass. I have made up my mind to send somebody, quite privately, to the great scenes of national labour. He must be somebody whom nobody knows, and nobody suspects of being connected with the administration, or we shall never get the truth--and the person I have fixed upon is yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of the subtreasury, then, as {{contrasted with}} a {{national}} bank for the before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium. (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent. (3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show {{the truth of the}} first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository of the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost constantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes. The natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation. But, again, by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I anticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said {{that it is not the}} policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message recommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words: ...|$|E
