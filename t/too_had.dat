5|$|Bolton {{were playing}} {{in their second}} League Cup Final, having lost the 1995 edition 2–1 to Liverpool. Middlesbrough <b>too</b> <b>had</b> never {{previously}} won the competition: in 1997 they lost the final after extra time in a replay against Leicester City, {{and a year later}} they lost 2–0 to Chelsea after extra time. In 1997, they also lost the FA Cup final to Chelsea, and were relegated from the Premier League. Although Middlesbrough, founded in 1876, were without a major trophy, Bolton had 4 FA Cups from 7 finals between 1894 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|Clydesdale (or Strathclyde) was {{the heartland}} of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde; by Donnchadh's day the Scots had settled many English and Continental Europeans (principally Flemings) in the region, and {{administered}} it through the sheriffdom of Lanark. Gaelic <b>too</b> <b>had</b> penetrated much of the old Northumbrian and Strathclyde territory, coming from the west, south-west and the north, a situation that led historian Alex Woolf to compare the region to the Balkans. The British language of the area, {{as a result of}} such developments, was probably either dead or almost dead, perhaps surviving only in the uplands of Clydesdale, Tweeddale and Annandale.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{had been}} in turmoil {{since the start of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this <b>too</b> <b>had</b> been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.|$|E

5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a first down. The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they <b>too</b> <b>had</b> difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a first down off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on the horizon and {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit. Loire was faster than Mermaid in the high winds but was unable to outrun Kangaroo, which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between the combatants was greatly unbalanced, and Kangaroo eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. Loire <b>too</b> <b>had</b> been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage Mermaid—by then the only pursuer still within reach.|$|E

5|$|The Germans, <b>too,</b> <b>had</b> {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost}} its offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Apropos had run her ashore {{soon after}} Emerald {{had entered the}} harbour. The harbour {{batteries}} having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach. The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart. British casualties were heavy. Emerald had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties <b>too</b> <b>had</b> been heavy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he <b>too</b> <b>had</b> other production commitments.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it <b>too</b> <b>had</b> technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, <b>too,</b> <b>had</b> lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he <b>too</b> <b>had</b> not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E

5|$|All of the {{surviving}} ships except Condorcet were reduced to second-line roles by 1920. Mirabeau was not repaired after her salvage and was hulked {{for a few years}} before being sold. Vergniaud was in bad shape and became a target ship before she was sold for scrap. Voltaire and Diderot had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships before they were condemned in the mid-1930s. Condorcet was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s before she <b>too</b> <b>had</b> her underwater protection modernized. She also became a training ship after its completion, but she was hulked in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school. The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship. Condorcet was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and refloated the following year before being scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he <b>too</b> <b>had</b> been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm <b>too</b> <b>had</b> reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E

5|$|During the night, the American artillery, {{under the}} command of Henry Knox, {{occasionally}} fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge. As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men <b>too</b> <b>had</b> evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E
5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by Schleswig-Holstein, though it <b>too</b> <b>had</b> failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{maintained}} {{in the lead}} until lap 25, when he made a pit stop for tyres. He resumed the lead from Rosberg after he <b>too</b> <b>had</b> to pit for new tyres. During this series of pitstops, Sebastian Vettel gained a position by passing Felipe Massa for third place. On lap 34, Max Verstappen retired while in a points-scoring position after his Toro Rosso was engulfed by smoke. On lap 42, Räikkönen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose. This put Jenson Button briefly into the tenth and final points position but for Sergio Pérez quickly passing the McLaren-Honda driver after a race long battle that begun at the start, for last position.|$|E
