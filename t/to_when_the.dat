5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of limited}} data {{concerning}} gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> prototypes {{of what is}} now the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the Malay archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese gong tradition, which is what the kulintang was believed to be derived from, developed only by the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate as}} <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict}} started. Proposed dates {{for the first}} war are either 547 or 549. At {{the same time as}} the two peoples took the field, a 10,000-strong Byzantine horse army under the command of John, the magister militum of Illyricum, marched against the Gepids. Before John's arrival, Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted. As a result, when the Byzantines arrived, the war had already ended, but not before they had clashed with the Gepids' Herulian allies. To seal the truce, Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up Ildigis, a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court. Thurisind refused, but he did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, {{although}} the 1901 census shows {{that she was still}} living with her parents. The marriage {{does not appear to have}} been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and no information relating <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> couple separated.|$|E

During World War II, he had led an Ahnenerbe expedition to find the entrance of Shambhala. However, afraid of what the Nazis would do with the power found in the Cintamani Stone, Schäfer shot and killed all {{of the members of the}} expedition but himself.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics who {{identify}} {{issues with the}} traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that {{should not have been}} available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>The</b> Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{vary with}} regards <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{singular}} Dąbrowski Legion was expanded into multiple Legions. Pivka and Roffe {{note that in}} May 1797 the Legion was reorganized into two formations, the first being commanded by Karol Kniaziewicz and the second by Józef Wielhorski, each numbering about 3,750 infantry, not counting artillery support. Davies, however, states that the Second Legion was formed in 1798 under Józef Zajączek. In July 1797 the Legions suppressed another insurrection, this time in Reggio Emilia.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief of}} the {{garrison}} and replacement with fresh troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the 1st Polish Carpathian Brigade replace the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade.

On 10October, for security reasons and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division.

5|$|Traditional {{arts and}} crafts are {{produced}} throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common. Imigongo, a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back <b>to</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> region {{was part of the}} independent Gisaka kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes. Other crafts include pottery and wood carving. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as nyakatsi) are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron.|$|E
