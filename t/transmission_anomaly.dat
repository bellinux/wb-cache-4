40|$|ABSTRACT] Ionospheric {{disturbances}} preceding large earthquakes {{have been}} reported, recently. Those are devided into two types; one is <b>transmission</b> <b>anomaly</b> of radio station signals such as VLF navigation system (Omega system) and VHF broadcasting signals {{and the other}} is anomalous density distribution of ionosphere. As for latter one, convincing results were reported by Liu et al(2000, 2001). It was pre-seismic ionospheric phenomena associated with Chi-Chi earthquake, Taiwan (21 / 09 / 1999, Mw 7. 8) by using Ionosonde. The aim {{of this study is to}} verify the ionospheric disturbances of electron density associated with large earthquakes. In this paper, we analyzed total electron content (TEC) variation with the use of GPS (Global positioning System) data around the day of Tottori earthquake (06 / 10 / 2000 M 7. 3) and Geiyo earthquake(24 / 03 / 2001 M 6. 4) ...|$|E

The light <b>transmission</b> <b>anomaly</b> in the deep-sea water after 36 days became atypically greater (∼ 35 %) and more extensive (thickness ∼ 1500  m) near the trench axis owing to the turbulent diffusion of fresh seafloor sediment, coordinated with potential seafloor displacement. In addition to the chemical influx associated with sediment diffusion, an influx of 13 C-enriched methane from the deep sub-seafloor reservoirs was estimated. This isotopically unusual methane influx was possibly triggered by the earthquake and its aftershocks that subsequently induced changes in the sub-seafloor hydrogeologic structures. The whole prokaryotic biomass {{and the development of}} specific phylotypes in the deep-sea microbial communities could rise and fall at 36 and 98 days, respectively, after the event.

40|$|Abstract. Resonant {{scattering}} of plane waves by a periodic slab under conditions close {{to those that}} support a guided mode is accompanied by sharp <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies.</b> For two-dimensional structures, we establish sufficient conditions, involving structural symmetry, under which these <b>anomalies</b> attain total <b>transmission</b> and total reflection at frequencies separated by an arbitrarily small amount. The loci of total reflection and total transmission are real-analytic curves in frequency-wavenumber space that intersect quadratically at a single point corresponding to the guided mode. A single anomaly or multiple anomalies can be excited by the interaction with a single guided mode.

The scattering problem in the diffraction regime is investigated in this part, for which the size of the period is comparable to the incident wavelength. We distinguish scattering resonances and real eigenvalues, and derive their asymptotic expansions when they are away from the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies. Furthermore, we present quantitative analysis of the field enhancement at resonant frequencies, by quantifying both the enhancement order and the associated resonant modes. The field enhancement near the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies is also investigated. It is demonstrated that the field enhancement becomes weaker at the resonant frequency if it is close to the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies. Finally, we also characterize the embedded eigenvalues for the underlying periodic structure, and point out that <b>transmission</b> <b>anomaly</b> such as Fano resonant phenomenon does not occur for the narrow slit array.

We also derive the leading asymptotic behavior of the related phenomenon of resonant enhancement near the guided mode. The theory applies to structures in which losses are negligible and to very general geometries of the unit cell. It is based on boundary-integral representations of the electromagnetic fields. These depend on the frequency and on the Bloch wave vector and provide a complex-analytic connection in these parameters between generalized scattering states and guided slab modes. The perturbation of three coincident zeros-those of the dispersion relation for slab modes, the reflection constant, and the transmission constant-is central to calculating <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies</b> both for lossless dielectric materials and for perfect metals...|$|R

The model elucidates a phenomenon common in electromagnetics, {{in which the}} interaction of plane waves with embedded guided modes of the waveguide causes sharp <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies</b> and field amplification. The ambient space is modeled by a planar lattice and the waveguide by a linear periodic lattice coupled to the planar one along a line. We show the existence of standing and traveling guided modes and analyze a tangent bifurcation, in which resonance is initiated at a critical coupling strength where a guided mode appears, beginning with a single standing wave and splitting {{into a pair of}} waves traveling in opposing directions.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{concerns}} {{the interaction between}} guided electromagnetic or acoustic modes of a penetrable periodic planar waveguide and plane waves originating from sources exterior to the waveguide. The interaction causes resonant enhancement of fields in the waveguide and anomalous transmission of energy across it. A guided mode is an eigenfunction {{of a member of}} the family of operators in the Floquet-Bloch decomposition of the periodic differential operator underlying the waveguide structure. The theory of existence or nonexistence of modes in ideal lossless waveguides is founded on variational principles. The mechanism for resonant scattering behavior is the dissolution of an embedded eigenvalue into the continuous spectrum, which corresponds to the destruction of a guided mode of a waveguide, upon pertur-bation of the wavevector or the material properties or geometry of the structure. Analytic perturbation of functions that unify the guided modes and the extended scattering states gives rise to asymptotic formulas for <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies...</b>|$|R

The knolls consist of three porphyritic andesite-to-dacite domes, each 1. 0 to 1. 5 km in diameter, with crests rang-ing from 1, 150 to 1, 520 m below sea level. An intense hydrothermal plume, with peak <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies</b> in excess of 40 %, originates from SuSu Knolls, and associated hydrothermal venting, with fluid temperatures exceeding 300 °C and sulfide mineralization, has been detected on the crests of all three edifices.

40|$|Group Delay and AM/PM {{conversion}} {{measurements are}} used as signal distortion indicators: In many practical measurement applications we deal with quasi linear systems which pass information {{with a high degree}} of fidelity. In order to verify the transmission performance through these systems, we can either approach them as linear networks and look for deviations from an ideal distortionless transfer function H(jw) in terms of deviations from constant amplitude and linear phase, or we can stimulate the network with a simulation of an actual information carrying signal (modulated signal) and observe the distortion on the information itself. In the first case, we can compute the expected signal distortion from static measurements of the deviation from constant amplitude 6 A(w) and linear phase 60 (w) via conversion tablfs for a variety of commonly used signals. In the second case, we are using a dynamic measurement approach by applying a modulated signal as a test signal and then deriving the expected signal distortion from the signal modifications observed on the test signal. The most commonly used parameters are deviations from constant gain over the information bandwidth and dynamic range of the system. This figure of merit is sometimes called gain linearity or differential gain when evaluated in the presence of another signal. Deviation from constant group delay is another distortion parameter which is used to detect <b>transmission</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the system. And again, when the phase change of the modulated signal is observed as a function of another signal, it is referred to as differential phase. Furthermore, there is the effect of modulation conversion in the form of, for example, Amplitude Modulation to Phase Modulation conversion which has to be characterized on networks and systems.

ABSTRACT (maximum 200 words) This thesis examines two implementations of the parabolic equation approximation to the acoustic wave equation aimed at removing three errors inherent to the wide-angle parabolic equation (WAPE) model. First, {{the selection of}} the range-step size used by the split-step Fourier algorithm affects the convergence of the solution. Second, in certain ocean environments WAPE incorrectly computes the down-range transmission loss. Finally, WAPE does not reproduce the standard normal mode basis set as defined by normal mode theory. A double-precision implementation of the WAPE (DP-WAPE) is developed to evaluate the dependence of solution convergence on the numerical precision of the model. Finally, an implementation that is insensitive to the choice of the reference sound speed (COPE) is evaluated for its ability to reduce or remove the latter two of these three errors. The stability ofthe WAPE solution was found to be unaffected by the DP-WAPE implementation. The range-step dependence is inherent to the split-step algorithm. The COPE corrects the <b>transmission</b> loss <b>anomaly</b> and satisfactorily reproduces the standard normal mode basis set...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from American Physical Society via the DOI in this record. The authors present a {{computationally}} efficient technique for the analysis of extraordinary transmission through both infinite and truncated periodic arrays of slots in perfect conductor screens of negligible thickness. An integral equation is obtained for the tangential electric field in the slots both in the infinite case and in the truncated case. The unknown functions are expressed as linear combinations of known basis functions, and the unknown weight coefficients are determined by means of Galerkin's method. The coefficients of Galerkin's matrix are obtained in the spatial domain in terms of double finite integrals containing the Green's functions (which, in the infinite case, is efficiently computed by means of Ewald's method) times cross-correlations between both the basis functions and their divergences. The computation in the spatial domain is an efficient alternative to the direct computation in the spectral domain since this latter approach involves the determination of either slowly convergent double infinite summations (infinite case) or slowly convergent double infinite integrals (truncated case). The results obtained are validated by means of commercial software, and it is found that the integral equation technique presented in this paper is at least two orders of magnitude faster than commercial software for a similar accuracy. It is also shown that the phenomena related to periodicity such as extraordinary <b>transmission</b> and Wood's <b>anomaly</b> start to appear in the truncated case for arrays with more than 100 (10 × 10) slots.

40|$|Mechanical {{failure of}} an ideal crystal is {{dictated}} either by an elastic instability or a soft-mode instability. Previous interpretations of nanoindentation experiments on suspended graphene sheets, however, indicate an anomaly: the inferred strain in the graphene sheet directly beneath the diamond indenter at the measured failure load is anomalously large compared to the fracture strains predicted by both soft-mode and acoustic analyses. Through multiscale modeling combining the results of continuum, atomistic, and quantum calculations, and analysis of experiments, we identify a strain-shielding effect initiated by mechanochemical interactions at the graphene–indenter interface as the operative mechanism responsible for this <b>anomaly.</b> <b>Transmission</b> electron micrographs and a molecular model of the diamond indenter’s tip suggest that the tip surface contains facets comprising crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } planes. Ab initio and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that a covalent bond (weld) formation between graphene and the crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } facets on the indenter’s surface can be induced by compressive contact stresses of the order achieved in nanoindentation tests. Finite element analysis (FEA) and MD simulations of nanoindentation reveal that the shear stiction provided by the induced covalent bonding restricts relative slip of the graphene sheet at its contact with the indenter, thus initiating a local strain-shielding effect. As a result, subsequent to stress-induced bonding at the graphene–indenter interface, the spatial variation of continuing incremental strain is substantially redistributed, locally shielding the region directly beneath the indenter by limiting the buildup of strain while imparting deformation to the surrounding regions. The extent of strain shielding is governed by {{the strength of the}} shear stiction, which depends upon the level of hydrogen saturation at the indenter’s surface. We show that at intermediate levels of hydrogen saturation the strain-shielding effect can enable the graphene to support experimentally determined fracture loads and displacements without prematurely reaching locally limiting states of stress and deformation...|$|R
