5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state <b>transducer</b> that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This <b>transducer</b> works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the <b>transducer.</b> The <b>transducer</b> resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped <b>transducer</b> maps each input to a single output.|$|E

40|$|Unsteady {{pressures}} {{were measured}} above the suction {{side of a}} blade that was oscillated to simulate blade stall flutter. Measurements were made at blade oscillation frequencies up to 500 Hz. Two types of miniature pressure <b>transducers</b> were used: surface-mounted flat custom-made, and conventional miniature, body-mounted <b>transducers.</b> The signals of the surface-mounted <b>transducers</b> are significantly affected by blade acceleration, whereas the signals of body-mounted <b>transducers</b> are practically free of this distortion. A procedure was introduced to correct the signals of surface-mounted <b>transducers</b> to rectify the signal distortion due to blade acceleration. The signals from body-mounted <b>transducers,</b> and corrected signals from surface-mounted <b>transducers</b> represent true unsteady pressure signals {{on the surface of}} a blade subjected to forced oscillations. However, the use of body-mounted conventional <b>transducers</b> is preferred for the following reasons: no signal corrections are needed for blade acceleration, the conventional <b>transducers</b> are noticeably less expensive than custom-made flat <b>transducers,</b> the survival rate of body-mounted <b>transducers</b> is much higher, and finally installation of body-mounted <b>transducers</b> does not disturb the blade surface of interest...|$|R
5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive <b>transducer</b> requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the <b>transducer</b> and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} <b>transducer</b> at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the <b>transducer</b> are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the <b>transducer</b> coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its <b>transducer</b> header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the <b>transducer</b> head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the computational power of particular tree <b>transducers,</b> viz., macro tree <b>transducers</b> and attributed tree <b>transducers.</b> The former tree <b>transducers</b> formalize {{the idea of}} syntax-directed translation, {{with the possibility of}} handling context; the latter tree <b>transducers</b> can serve as a formal model for the reduction semantics of attribute grammars. Here we generalize these tree <b>transducers</b> by allowing the invocation of external functions during the usual rewriting process. The main result of this paper is the characterization of macro tree <b>transducers</b> with external function calls in terms of attributed tree <b>transducers</b> with external function calls. Furthermore, such tree <b>transducers</b> with external function calls induce, in an obvious way, two operators on the set of all classes of tree functions. According to this point of view, we define two classes of tree functions inductively {{in the same way as}} the class PREC of primitive recursive tree functions, except that the closure under the scheme of primitive recursion is replaced by the closure under macro tree <b>transducers</b> with external function calls and attributed tree <b>transducers</b> with external function calls, respectively.

25|$|<b>Transducer</b> {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT <b>transducer</b> but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of <b>transducer</b> folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a <b>transducer</b> with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints.

The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the <b>transducer</b> and receiver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Courcelle (1992) {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} using logic, in particular Monadic second-order logic (MSO), to define graph to graph transformations. <b>Transducers,</b> on the other hand, are executable machine models to define transformations, and are typically studied in the context of string-to-string transformations. Engelfriet and Hoogeboom (2001) studied two-way finite state string-to-string <b>transducers</b> and showed that their expressiveness matches MSO-definable transformations (MSOT). Alur and Čern´y (2011) presented streaming transducers—oneway <b>transducers</b> equipped with multiple registers that can store output strings, as an equi-expressive model. Natural generalizations of streaming <b>transducers</b> to string-to-tree (Alur and D’Antoni, 2012) and infinite-string-to-string (Alur, Filiot, and Trivedi, 2012) cases preserve MSO-expressiveness. While earlier reductions from MSOT to streaming <b>transducers</b> used two-way <b>transducers</b> as the intermediate model, we revisit the earlier reductions in a more general, and previously unexplored, setting of infinite-string-to-tree transformations, and provide a direct reduction.
