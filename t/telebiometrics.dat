It defines protocols for biometric authentication of unspecified end-users and service providers on open networks. In the open network, {{there are various}} biometric communication devices for the end-users. And there are various security policies for network services on the providers. This draft Recommendation defines nine <b>telebiometrics</b> authentication models for the environment. And it defines the negotiation protocol for the policies and device environments using the models, and it defines the requirements of biometric transportation data for the each model...|$|E
