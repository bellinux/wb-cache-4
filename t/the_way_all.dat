5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes her out of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>All</b> three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|To stop this, the Spartan {{commander}} ordered {{some of his}} men {{to charge}} the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, and then, when the Spartans turned {{to return to the}} regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, about a half mile away. The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke and ran for the boats, pursued by the peltasts all <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>All</b> in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed.|$|E

With John leading <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>all</b> were eventually caught and killed, achieving a great victory and removing the ongoing Saracen threat on the Italian mainland.

25|$|On 11 November a Martinsyde {{and nine}} B E.'s, loaded with bombs and petrol, left the Kantara and Mahemdia {{aerodromes}} {{at dawn and}} assembled at Mustabig, just west of Bir el Mazar. There a raiding force of five B.E.'s and the Martinsyde formed the largest force yet organised by Australians or any other air squadron in the East, filled up with petrol and bombs and set off in formation towards Beersheba. Over Beersheba the anti-aircraft guns engaged them with high explosive and shrapnel, and the raiders flew through a flurry of white, black, and green bursts. The Martinsyde dropped a 100–lb. bomb fair in {{the centre of the}} aerodrome; two 20–lb. bombs hit tents; others made direct hits on the railway to Beersheba and the station. A Fokker and an Aviatik took to the air but were decisively beaten. After photographing Beersheba and the damage caused by the bombs, the airmen returned, reconnoitering Khan Yunis and Rafa on <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>All</b> machines arrived safely, after having spent seven hours in flight. Two days later a German aeroplane retaliated by bombing Cairo.|$|E

500|$|.....To prepare Mau Piailug for the voyage, David Lewis briefed {{him on the}} {{geography}} of the islands {{in this part of}} the Pacific and the winds and currents that could be expected along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>all</b> information that an early Polynesian navigator acquainted with this route would have carried in his head. In addition, to alert Mau of how the elevation of stars above the northern and southern horizons would change as the canoe sailed farther and farther south, we held training sessions in Honolulu's Bishop Museum planetarium to graphically show how, for example, as one sailed toward Tahiti Polaris sank lower and lower on the northern horizon until it disappeared at the equator while the Southern Cross curved higher and higher in the sky. During his first few days of the voyage, Mau received further coaching on the pattern of winds and currents from Rodo Williams, a veteran Tahitian seaman on the crew who the year before had sailed a yacht from Tahiti to Hawaii and could therefore provide Mau with a firsthand account of what he could expect to encounter.|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of The New York Times {{felt that}} the episode was problematic. He thought that having Kurt {{sabotage}} his own audition sent out a [...] "mixed message", and believed that actress Lauren Potter was [...] "used as a prop in the continuing humanization of Sue Sylvester." [...] Hale wrote that the storyline felt [...] "smarmy and artificial", though praised Lynch for making the scene with Sue's sister [...] "warm and real". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson {{felt that the}} revelation about Sue's sister was [...] "a little manipulative", though wrote that he [...] "didn't care in that glorious moment." [...] He hoped that Glee writers would not humanize Sue too often, however, fearing that she would lose her [...] "dictatorial swagger". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 7.5/10, commenting: [...] "I really hope that episode was about {{getting a lot of}} 'issue' storylines out of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>all</b> at once, because {{that was a lot of}} overkill." [...] He felt that, although the episode contained [...] "the usual strong humor, warm character moments and catchy musical performances", overall it felt [...] "very afterschool special".|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>all</b> of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E

2500|$|Emerson toured Europe in 1833 {{and later}} wrote of his travels in English Traits (1856). He left aboard the brig Jasper on Christmas Day, 1832, sailing first to Malta.

2500|$|When {{the time}} came {{that he should be}} brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, [...] "That which I have preached I will seal with my blood." [...] Then Mr. Woodroofe said, [...] "Thou art an heretic." [...] "That shall be known," [...] quoth Mr. Rogers, [...] "at the Day of Judgment." [...] "Well," [...] said Mr. Woodroofe, [...] "I will never pray for thee." [...] "But I will pray for you," [...] said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>all</b> the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the {{presence}} of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ." ...|$|E
