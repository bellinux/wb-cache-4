25|$|Not many Michelia {{species have}} so far become horticulturally or {{economically}} important, apart for their wood. Both subgenus Magnolia and subgenus Yulania include species of major horticultural importance, and a change of name would be very undesirable for many people, especially in the horticultural branch. In Europe, Magnolia even {{is more or less}} a synonym for Yulania, since most of the cultivated species on <b>this</b> <b>continent</b> have Magnolia (Yulania) denudata as one of their parents. Most taxonomists who acknowledge close relations between Yulania and Michelia therefore support the third option and join Michelia with Magnolia.|$|E
25|$|For example: the {{similarity}} of southern continent geological formations had led Roberto Mantovani to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had once been joined into a supercontinent; Wegener noted {{the similarity}} of Mantovani's and his own maps of the former positions of the southern continents. In Mantovani's conjecture, <b>this</b> <b>continent</b> broke due to volcanic activity caused by thermal expansion, and the new continents drifted {{away from each other}} because of further expansion of the rip-zones, where the oceans now lie. This led Mantovani to propose an Expanding Earth theory which has since been shown to be incorrect.|$|E

Models searches were being conducted in five territories: France, Germany, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom. Finalists was selected from each territory with the final two winners being announced in November 2011 in conjunction with the release of Need for Speed: The Run.

500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration.

He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth on <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition {{that all men are created}} equal." ...|$|E
500|$|The tension over Nicaragua soon abated, but the May 1895 {{death of}} Secretary Gresham, who like Bayard had favored {{cooperation}} with the British, led to increased disagreement over the Venezuela issue. [...] Cleveland appointed Richard Olney {{to take over the}} State Department, and Olney soon proved more confrontational than his predecessor. [...] Olney's opinion, soon adopted by Cleveland, was that the Monroe Doctrine not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. [...] Olney drafted a long dispatch {{on the history of the}} problem, declaring that [...] "to-day the United States is practically sovereign on <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition..." [...] Bayard delivered the note to the British Prime Minister (Lord Salisbury, who was also serving as Foreign Secretary) on August 7, 1895.|$|E

500|$|In July 1895 new Secretary of State Richard Olney (succeeding Gresham, {{who died}} in office {{at the end of}} May) sent a {{document}} to London which became known as [...] "Olney's twenty-inch gun" [...] (the draft was 12,000 words long). The note reviewed the history of the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute and of the Monroe Doctrine, and it firmly insisted on the application of the Doctrine to the case, declaring that [...] "today the United States is practically sovereign on <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition." [...] At this point the President and the Secretary of State as well as the US public [...] "had been brought to believe that Britain was in the wrong, that the vital interests of the United States were involved, and the United States must intervene." [...] The note had little impact on the British Government, partly because Joseph Chamberlain, at the Colonial Office, thought it possible that the colony had a major gold-bearing region around the Schomburgk line, and partly because the Government rejected the idea that the Monroe Doctrine had any relevance for the boundary dispute.

500|$|Final Fantasy XII is set {{within the}} land of Ivalice during an age when [...] "magic was commonplace" [...] and [...] "airships plied the skies, {{crowding}} out the heavens". At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells and in powering airships—a popular form of transportation in Ivalice. Ivalice {{is divided into three}} continents:Ivalice - The region consisting of the three continents of Valendia, Ordalia, and Kerwon, blessed throughout with verdant natural landscapes and climatic conditions supporting a great variety of life. [...] Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon. Ordalia is located {{in the western part of}} Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of <b>this</b> <b>continent</b> as the eastern portion of it is largely desert and [...] "jagd"—lawless regions so rich in Mist, the ethereal manifestation of magicite, that airships cannot function. Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia, where lush highlands dot the landscape. Central to the story is Dalmasca, a small kingdom between the two continents and empires. Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia, Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert. The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon to the south and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia. During this time, Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia. Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.|$|E
500|$|John Roebling was a {{contrasting}} {{character to}} Charles Ellet. [...] Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds, Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve, taking a scientific approach to all interests. [...] Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings, even to his closest associates. [...] The man, however, dared to confront his detractors and make bold exaltations about his work. [...] He openly called European suspension bridges—including American suspension bridges built with European techniques—weak, and occasionally sniped at Ellet's and Stephenson's works. [...] He announced that his Brooklyn Bridge, when completed, [...] "will {{not only be}} the greatest bridge in existence, {{but it will be}} the greatest engineering work of <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> and of the age." [...] Roebling's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge, early in their careers. [...] During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project, Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the American Railroad Journal. [...] Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract, Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet's assistant. [...] He received a formal reply without any reference to his request, and his subsequent letter was ignored. [...] When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid, he successfully applied to be the contractor's chief engineer. [...] Ellet, however, persisted with his tactics and snatched the project away from the contractor; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment. [...] From then on, Ellet and Roebling became rivals, vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America. [...] Roebling learned from their rivalry. [...] His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired.|$|E
