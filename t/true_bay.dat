50|$|The 'Bay' {{is not a}} <b>true</b> <b>bay</b> at all, but a large tidal basin. It is {{enclosed}} by the villages of Kinloss and Findhorn to the East, and Culbin Forest to the West. It drains the river Findhorn and the Muckle Burn.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the plant}} is uncertain. It {{has been suggested that}} the species may be native to the Mediterranean, and that the California specimens may actually be introduced. If, however, it is a <b>true</b> <b>Bay</b> Area endemic, the plant is rare and threatened by habitat destruction and disturbance. It is a resident of salt marsh and other wet coastal habitat.|$|E

2500|$|The palest shades, which lack {{specific}} English terminology {{found in}} other languages, are called wild bays. Wild <b>bays</b> are <b>true</b> <b>bays</b> with fully pigmented reddish coat color and black manes and tails, but the black points only extend up to the pastern or fetlock. Wild bay is often found {{in conjunction with a}} trait called [...] "pangare" [...] that produces pale color on the underbelly and soft areas, such as near the stifle and around the muzzle.|$|R

5000|$|Dead Chest {{is little}} more than a large rock {{outcropping}} located just under one half mile north east (0.4 miles at 27 degrees <b>true)</b> of Deadman's <b>Bay</b> on Peter Island, British Virgin Islands. [...] It is uninhabited, has no fresh water or trees and only sparse vegetation. It was formerly used as a firing range by the Royal Virgin Islands Police, but the opening of the nearby hotel on Peter Island coincided with the decision to build a proper firing range on the island of Tortola. The island is now an uninhabited National Park, with several popular Scuba diving and snorkeling sites.|$|R
60|$|It was a flat calm, and the packets {{were all}} {{dropping}} down the bay with the ebb. The day was lovely, {{and the view}} of the harbour, which has so many, while it wants so many, of the elements of first-rate scenery, was rarely finer. All estuaries are most beautiful viewed in the calm; but this is peculiarly <b>true</b> of the <b>Bay</b> of New York--neither the colour of the water, nor its depth, nor the height of the surrounding land, being favourable to the grander efforts of Nature. There is little that is sublime in either the Hudson, or its mouth; but there is the very extreme of landscape beauty.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Throughout {{the process}} of this {{dissertation}} I have explored an architecture that can truly represent {{the reality of the}} manufactured landscape and the complexities of such a morphology. It is with this interest that I found Granger Bay and its inherently manufactured qualities. It is a landscape that is simultaneously natural and artificial. An enquiry into the shift from the natural to the artificial was explored in terms of what it means for our reading of place as well as how architecture can encompass this new terrain. In the study of this site, like an archaeological investigation, the story of ‘unbuilding to build’ arose from the ground; discovering Granger <b>Bay’s</b> <b>true</b> genius loci, which is grounded in rubble and the stories of the buildings that make up its rubble ground. It was with these ideas that I allowed the landscape to inform and generate a unique architectural language where boundaries are blurred between nature and man-made and enclosure and opening. The key informants to this design are the various geometries and forces that act on the site: Fort Wynyard’s sight lines, the buried natural landscape, the ocean, rubble ground and the memory of the Alhambra Theatre. Through design I hope to have harnessed the sites latent energies and unleash the potential of Granger Bay’s favourable location with key infrastructure and public space...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{anthropogenic}} infrastructure {{has significantly}} modified nearshore environments. Because these structures {{often have a}} strong association with shipping as would be found in ports and harbors, they {{have been identified as}} invasion hotspots. Due to propagule pressure from shipping and recreational boating and suitable uncolonized substrate that provides a refuge from native predators, a greater number of non-native species have been found on these structures compared to nearby natural substrate. The mechanisms that limit the spread of non-native species from anthropogenic structures to natural substrate have been explored for several taxa at a species-specific level, but less so from an overall community perspective. Predation has been identified as one of the biotic interactions limiting invasion success. In addition to predation, dispersal ability may also prevent the spread of non-native species from anthropogenic structures to natural substrate. This thesis addresses how these two mechanisms interact to limit the spread of non-native species from anthropogenic structures to natural substrate and how that alters overall community composition. I aimed to explore differences between communities inside and outside of a marina and {{determine the extent to which}} predator and dispersal limitation were structuring these communities. I used a three-factor design, deploying seven unglazed ceramic tiles per each treatment combination of 1) in versus outside a marina in Yaquina Bay, Oregon; 2) cage keeping out predators greater than the mesh size, no cage, or partial cage; 3) fixed near the substrata (benthic) versus suspended 1 meter below the surface. I also transplanted caged, suspended tiles of either adults or recruits from inside the marina to benthic and suspended caging treatments outside of the marina. These tiles allowed me to examine predation when dispersal limitation was not a factor for the community inside the marina, i. e. what happens to both recruits and adults if they can get outside of the marina. I found that the communities inside and outside of the marina were different and the data suggest that both predation and dispersal limitation interact to limit the spread of non-native species. Additionally, I found that mesopredators that could fit through the caging may be influencing predation results and community structure. This research addresses gaps in scientific knowledge regarding the mechanisms that prevent or facilitate the spread of non-native species. Future work could include the further exploration of mesopredation as an important factor in limiting the spread of non-native species and exploring dispersal limitation more in depth as well as broadening the geographic scope to see if the same trends hold <b>true</b> across <b>bays</b> and bioregions...|$|R
40|$|Coral {{recruitment}} {{was recorded}} on tiles deployed at Columbus Park reef (CPR) within Discovery Bay, Jamaica {{and at the}} CARICOMP site on the West Fore Reef Slope (WFR) outside Discovery Bay. Spiny lobster pueruli and motile invertebrates were recorded using Witham collectors deployed at approximately the same sites {{as well as two}} additional sites: the Blue Hole (BH) (within Discovery Bay) and Dairy Bull Reef (DBR) (outside Discovery Bay). Prior to the early 1980 's CPR, WFR and DBR had high scleractinian coral cover. Today CPR is characterized by coral rubble, zooanthids and Millepora, WFR is characterized by high algal cover and low percent coral cover, and DBR still has high coral cover. The rate of coral recruitment on the WFR was higher (203 spat m- 2) than on the CPR (136 spat m- 2). Acroporid recruitment was low, with only 3 spat m- 2 (< 1 % of total recruitment) on the WFR and no acroporid spat on tiles at CPR. Agariciids and poritids were the dominant taxa recruiting to tiles at CPR and the WFR, respectively. While protected inshore waters are the preferred settlement habitat for spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) pueruli in other Caribbean studies, this was not <b>true</b> for Discovery <b>Bay.</b> No pueruli settled on Witham collectors deployed at CPR and BH. The numbers of other invertebrate species and individuals settling on collectors at the CPR and BH were much lower than on the WFR and DBR. It is hypothesized that anthropogenic activities are adversely affecting the water quality in Discovery Bay, and this, in turn, is adversely affecting the recruitment of scleractinian corals and motile invertebrates.
