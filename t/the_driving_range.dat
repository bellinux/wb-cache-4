5|$|Bertuzzi and his wife, Julie, {{were married}} in July 1996. They have two {{children}} born one-and-a-half years apart in Vancouver, a son named Tag and a daughter named Jaden. His son, Tag Bertuzzi, was drafted into the OHL by the Guelph Storm, 2nd overall in 2017.Bertuzzi is a recreational golfer and has credited the sport with allowing him to relax more as a hockey player. During his 10-game suspension from the NHL in October and November 2001, he played golf to focus his energy. Afterwards, he made it a custom to go to <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> before every game.|$|E

She met her first husband David Esch in 1994 on <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> at Moon Valley Country Club, Phoenix, Arizona, where she was an LPGA rookie practicing for a tournament and he worked for club manufacturer Ping. They were engaged at the 1995 Evian Masters, married in Lake Tahoe on 4 January 1997, and were divorced in 2005. In August 2007 she became engaged to Mike McGee, the managing director for the ANNIKA brand of businesses and son of former PGA Tour and Champions Tour player Jerry McGee. They married at Lake Nona Golf & Country Club in Orlando, Florida, on 10 January 2009.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} of the energy storage system of a parallel hybrid plug-in car. The objective is to study how <b>the</b> electric <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> is influenced by factors such as package volume and auxiliary power consumption. Simulation and optimisation are used {{to find the most}} cost effective battery arrangement for specified electric <b>driving</b> <b>range,</b> volume, power and lifetime requirements. Two battery technologies, NiMH and Li-ion, are included in the simplified case study. The result indicates that the battery cost and size are highly dependent on <b>the</b> required electric <b>driving</b> <b>range.</b> It is found that a 3 ± 5 km electric <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> is possible with a minor cost increase. An electric <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> of 15 ± 25 km is possible, but results in a more bulky, and much more costly, battery system. It is {{important to point out that}} the results are not general. <b>The</b> electric <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> can be significantly extended by decreasing the roll and/or the air resistance...|$|R

25|$|With {{the rise}} of Solihull, a road {{connecting}} to Hockley Heath became formed. Along this road, the Four Ashes (after which the recently developed estate was named) became a landmark – records show the trees being present in 1662 and marking the Parish boundary. They were also mapped in 1725 even in preference to some local buildings of note. The ashes still exist today near to <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>range,</b> though they have been replaced several times since the earliest records.

500|$|In June 2011 Mitsubishi {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} lithium titanate oxide SCiB battery technology for its two new models of electric vehicles, the i-MiEV and Minicab MiEV. The SCiB technology was developed by Toshiba, which stated that its SCiB batteries can withstand 2.5 times more charge/discharge cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the AC Level 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. In terms of performance, the SCiB battery offers a higher effective capacity than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the carmaker could install a smaller battery with less weight and keep the same range to contribute to lower the vehicle price as compared to lithium-ion batteries. [...] Recharging is estimated to take 14 hours from a 110 volt power supply, 7 hours from a 220 volt power supply and as little as 30 minutes from a quick charging station. The SCiB {{is available in the}} Japanese market. The U.S. has a more typical lithium ion battery.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the stadium}} threat to Langston Golf Course gone, {{a number of}} {{improvements}} went ahead. In 1988, the Nation's Capital Bicentennial Celebration committee said it would spearhead a $15 million fund-raising project to build a family golf center at Langston. This project, however, was not forthcoming. In 1999, heavy rains washed away some fairways and greens, exposing buried trash (such as household appliances). An $8 million project to regrade the course to improve drainage began. A year later, the concessionaire agreed to begin a series of projects to bring Langston Golf Course up to Professional Golfers Association standards. In 2002, a print of a painting by noted local artist Linwood Barnes depicting Clyde Martin taking the first drive at Langston Golf Course was hung in the clubhouse. In May 2002, Langston Golf Course {{became one of the}} first courses to host a First Tee chapter, a program designed to interest minorities and economically disadvantaged children in golf. In 2002 and 2003, Langston Golf Course opened a putt-and-chip practice area for young golfers and a four-hole course for novices. An academic resource center with computer stations, a small library, and tutoring and study programs was also opened. Students from local junior and senior high schools who study their schoolwork in the education center for an hour are awarded a free hour golf on the course. In 2002, about 200 students took advantage of the educational center. (The number had risen to 400 students by 2006.) The National Park Service and the concessionaire also established a strategic plan to raise $12 million to $17 million in public and private funds to complete the upgrade to PGA tour standards, build a new clubhouse with banquet facilities, establish a museum dedicated to African American golfers, replace <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>range,</b> and expand the education center. In 2007, D.C. Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the [...] "Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act" [...] in Congress, legislation which would allow the National Park Service (NPS) to lease Langston and the other federally owned golf courses in the District of Columbia (rather than simply offer a concession contract). A long-term lease, Norton said, would allow the lessee to obtain high levels of capital investment funds and greatly improve the courses.|$|E

From May through July 1995, the water table elevations decreased in most monitor wells due to less precipitation and higher evapotranspiration. Review and evaluation of collected data suggest that irrigation of <b>the</b> golf <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> will have negligible effects on water levels and ground water flow patterns if rates of irrigation do not significantly exceed future rates of evapotranspiration...|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{meta-analysis}} of studies investigating consumer preferences for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) to provide insights into <b>the</b> way <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> is traded off for capital costs. We find {{that consumers are}} willing to pay, on average, between 66 and 75 US$ for a 1 -mile increase in <b>driving</b> <b>range.</b> Ceteris paribus, 100 -mile-range cars have to be priced about 60 % less than their conventional counterparts to become competitive. In line with intuition, but in contrast to most specifications employed in primary studies, we find that consumers' marginal willingness to pay (WTP) decreases at a diminishing rate with increases in <b>driving</b> <b>range.</b> <b>The</b> variation in the WTP and compensating variation estimates among examined studies {{can be attributed to}} differences in <b>the</b> levels of <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> considered, in other elements of the study design and in the country of study. Our findings support stated preference literature's conclusion that short <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> has been a major limitation to the large-scale adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and other AFVs, and that technological developments permitting longer <b>driving</b> <b>ranges</b> will, to some extent, facilitate their market penetration. We further propose that consumer valuation of <b>driving</b> <b>range</b> should not be examined in isolation from other attributes related to refuelling activities, such as refuelling duration and the coverage of refuelling infrastructure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
