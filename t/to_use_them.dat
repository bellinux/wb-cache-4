5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creator Ian Brennan and {{directed}} by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon.

5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E

5|$|Following their defeat, straggling gendarmes retreated {{back into}} Angola. Tshombe began {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to stage {{an invasion of}} the Congo, but this was cut short by his imprisonment in 1967. They reconstituted themselves as the Front de Libération Nationale Congolaise and made two attempts retake Katanga in the 1970s. Both failed, but secessionist insurgency activity continued. Hostilities resurfaced in 2006 after a new national constitution, which promulgated the division of Katanga into four new provinces, was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating {{a demonstration of the}} atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017 the {{critical}} WiFi vulnerability BroadPwn affecting many iOS devices, including the iPad 2 was published. It allows an attacker to remotely {{take control of}} all affected devices within WiFi range without any user interaction. Since iOS 9 is in its end of life the iPad 2 won't receive a security patch for this vulnerability, making it dangerous <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> further.|$|E

5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for use {{would have been a}} considerable expense, so it was never realized.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The Catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
30|$|The {{computational}} effort {{needed to}} evaluate Erlang multilocus probabilities {{need not be}} an obstacle <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>them</b> in a genetic linkage study. One can precompute many of the terms needed in the formulas and the remaining computations are small compared to the total computation time used in linkage programs.|$|R

5|$|The Outsider (Billy Lush) {{offers to}} help Corvo in his quest. Described as {{a mixture of}} God and the Devil, The Outsider {{imprints}} his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters. Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> up to the recipient.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} scrutiny being {{imposed by}} the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more drastic measures by broadcasting companies attempting <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.|$|E
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
50|$|Green {{coatings}} have no environmental downside <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>them.</b> They are non-toxic, water based, low VOCs, (Volatile Organic Compounds), no ODS (Ozone Depleting Substances), and Class A fire rated.

50|$|Ordinarily, a {{voluntary}} act refers to commission. However, as discussed below, some crimes do punish failure to act. A status is not {{a voluntary}} act. For example, no law will be constitutional {{that makes it a}} crime to be addicted to illegal drugs, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>them,</b> as happened in Robinson v. California.|$|R

5|$|The wargames {{from which}} Dungeons & Dragons evolved used {{miniature}} figures to represent combatants. D initially continued {{the use of}} miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original D set of 1974 required {{the use of the}} Chainmail miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as a visual reference.|$|E
5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} earrings made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The earrings were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she was not able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> until she had her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} were hung above {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} in the ring, with only the legal men allowed <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot in Team Canada, which Cage said he would consider.|$|E
50|$|Segui was {{identified}} by Jason Grimsley {{as one of}} the players that have taken human growth hormone during his major league career (he w{{as one of the}} players whose name was redacted on Grimsley's document).

5000|$|Arman (November 17, 1928 - October 22, 2005) was a French-born American artist. Born Armand Fernandez in Nice, France, Arman was {{a painter}} {{who moved from}} using objects for the ink or paint traces they leave ("cachet", [...] "allures d'objet") <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>them</b> as the {{painting}} itself. He {{is best known for}} his [...] "accumulations" [...] and destruction/recomposition of objects.|$|R
5000|$|Design with Memory of the Material -This {{strategy}} is for finding successful paths to re-use materials. Materials that are discarded {{can be a}} rich resource for new product development. Adding value to the material through artistic design is the key <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>them</b> successfully. A winning entry example of this {{strategy is}} the elegant baskets woven from discarded industrial metal strapping.|$|R
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E
