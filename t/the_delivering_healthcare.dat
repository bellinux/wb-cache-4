40|$|Although {{primary care}} is at <b>the</b> {{forefront}} of <b>delivering</b> <b>healthcare</b> to <b>the</b> population, {{its role in}} preventing poor health has varied throughout history. Faced with growing demand on healthcare services and a rise in noncommunicable diseases, some health systems are attempting to integrate healthcare delivery with broader population health and wellbeing interventions. Liverpool has a rich history of taking action to improve population health; this paper discusses a range of interventions {{that have taken place}} across the city. There is a renewed opportunity to systematise approaches to primary and secondary prevention, strengthened by the lead that general practitioners now have in commissioning health services and their accountability for improved population health outcomes through clinical commissioning groups.  This is strongly articulated in the Healthy Liverpool program, a city-wide plan for health and care services. This paper suggests that four key enablers strengthen delivery of public health priorities through primary care: maximising opportunities to identify risk factors for preventable disease, fully exploiting the data collected in primary care to plan and design services, responding to community needs and assets through community engagement, and addressing wider determinants of health through strong partnerships...|$|R

This study sought to explore and describe the experiences of nurse leaders in delivering care to youth victims of violence at a community health centre in Khayelitsha. A qualitative, descriptive, and contextual design was used. The accessible population was professional nurses (N = 40) taking the lead in influencing victims of violence in the community to wellness. Nine individual unstructured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. The findings of this study showed that nurse leaders experienced challenges in terms of under-preparedness, staff shortages, work load, verbal abuse, as well as victim-related factors. Participants also expressed some rewarding experiences, such as increased personal awareness, personal empowerment, victim empowerment, and job satisfaction.

40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibilities}} for video-based learning of computer systems in the field of medical education in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Background Low-income countries are forced to perform healthcare services with resources already spread too thin. The use of electronic medical records can increase <b>the</b> cost-effectiveness of <b>delivering</b> <b>healthcare</b> services, but <b>the</b> low computer literacy in sub-Saharan Africa is an obstacle necessary to overcome. E-learning and video-based learning has the potential to partially solve this problem. Methods User observations were conducted on five healthcare workers in rural Uganda. The users watched an instruction video, after which they performed an assessment test of an electronic medical record system. Results Some effectiveness was perceived – but it was slight, and varied greatly between the test subjects. Computer experience is an important prerequisite for the success of e-learning initiatives. Effectiveness was higher for more simple tasks. Conclusion This paper does not propose video-based learning as the only source of training for the target group. However, there is a possibility to envision video-based learning as a building block in a blended-learning strategy – utilising video-based learning for easier tasks and knowledge retention for users who are already familiar with the system...|$|R

Objective  The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and impact of patients presenting with fatigue in primary care, using the only known electronic database in Canada to capture patient-reported symptoms. Methods  Data were extracted from <b>the</b> <b>Deliver</b> Primary <b>Healthcare</b> Information (DELPHI) database, an electronic medical record database located in Ontario, Canada. Patients were identified using the International Classification of Primary Care, Revised Second Edition coding system. Two groups of patients (fatigue or non-fatigue symptom) were followed for one year and compared. Both descriptive and multivariable analyses were conducted. Results  A total of 103 fatigue symptom patients, and 103 non-fatigue symptom patients, were identified in the DELPHI database. The period prevalence of fatigue presentation was 8. 2 %, with the majority of patients being female and over 60 years of age. These patients experienced numerous co-occurring morbidities, in addition to the fatigue itself. During the one year follow-up period, fatigue symptom patients had significantly higher rates of subsequent visits (IRR = 1. 19,  p  = 0. 038) and investigations (IRR = 1. 68,  p  < 0. 001), and markedly high levels of referrals following their index visit.

40|$|Abstract Background Electronic {{medical records}} contain {{valuable}} clinical information {{not readily available}} elsewhere. Accordingly, they hold important potential for contributing to and enhancing chronic disease registries {{with the goal of}} improving chronic disease management; however a standard for diagnoses of conditions such as diabetes remains to be developed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish a validated electronic medical record definition for diabetes. Methods We constructed a retrospective cohort using health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences Ontario Diabetes Database linked with electronic medical records from <b>the</b> <b>Deliver</b> Primary <b>Healthcare</b> Information Project using data from 1 April 2006 - 31 March 2008 (N = 19, 443). We systematically examined eight definitions for diabetes diagnosis, both established and proposed. Results The definition that identified the highest number of patients with diabetes (N = 2, 180) while limiting to those with the highest probability of having diabetes was: individuals with ≥ 2 abnormal plasma glucose tests, or diabetes on the problem list, or insulin prescription, or ≥ 2 oral anti-diabetic agents, or HbA 1 c ≥ 6. 5 %. Compared to the Ontario Diabetes Database, this definition identified 13 % more patients while maintaining good sensitivity (75 %) and specificity (98 %). Conclusions This study establishes the feasibility of developing an electronic medical record standard definition of diabetes and validates an algorithm for use in this context. While the algorithm may need to be tailored to fit available data in different electronic medical records, it contributes to the establishment of validated disease registries with the goal of enhancing research, and enabling quality improvement in clinical care and patient self-management. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{number of}} people {{affected}} by Parkinson 2 ̆ 019 s disease (PD) is increasing in the United Kingdom driven by population ageing. The treatment of the disease is complex, resource intensive and currently there is no known cure to PD. The National Health Service (NHS), <b>the</b> public organisation <b>delivering</b> <b>healthcare</b> in <b>the</b> UK, is under financial pressures. There {{is a need to}} find innovative ways to improve the operational and financial performance of treating PD patients. The use of community services is a new and promising way of providing treatment and care to PD patients at reduced cost than hospital care. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential operational and financial benefits, which could be achieved through increased integration of community services in the delivery of treatment and care to PD patients in the UK without compromising care quality. Methods A Discrete Event Simulation model was developed to represent the PD care structure including patients 2 ̆ 019 pathways, treatment modes, and the mix of resources required to treat PD patients. The model was parametrised with data from a large NHS Trust in the UK and validated using information from the same trust. Four possible scenarios involving increased use of community services were simulated on the model. Results Shifting more patients with PD from hospital treatment to community services will reduce the number of visits of PD patients to hospitals by about 25...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I have made efforts towards {{investigating}} healthcare in two arenas. First, can a model with life expectancy {{as a proxy}} for healthcare quality be used to objectify the study of efficiency in the G 7 countries and Korea? Table 1 and the results section have illuminated many factor variables which vary between countries and characterize the environments in which different healthcare systems have developed. The analysis also illuminates an inherent structural difference in <b>the</b> mechanism of <b>delivering</b> <b>healthcare</b> throughout <b>the</b> developed world. Secondly, can these aggregate data be used to show us anything new about the studies performed by Peter Zweifel and Friedrich Breyer? Did the SISYPHUS Syndrome disappear in the early 1990 s as Zweifel suggested in 2002 ? No, in Table 2 I have demonstrated through SURS that over the time period 1990 - 2009 there are clear statistically significant SISYPH variables in at least Canada, Germany, Korea, and Britain. Lastly, can I confirm Breyer’s model of HCE in Germany and can it be useful in other countries? Yes to extent possible the methodologies were replicated in a SURS fashion in an effort to simultaneously test and examine different variables in different countries. I was unable to confirm the results of Breyer in his 2011 examination of the sickness fund members for Germany.

Objectives: To gain an insight into how (if at all) the professional identity of student nurses had been impacted through volunteering as health care workers in Nepal. Method: The research used the phenomenological paradigm. Five student nurses, who had volunteered in Nepal as healthcare workers and participated in the CWON/SVPI program for three week intervals, were interviewed.
