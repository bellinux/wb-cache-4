Compliance with the regulations given by the PSAN (Petroleum Safety Authority Norway) requires annual testing of these valves. The testing of safety critical valves are essential to increase {{the probability that the}} valves are able to conduct intended functions, and beneficial to improve safety and regularity. Moreover, "Too often" testing can lead to unnecessary production loss, with major economic consequences, and the danger/risk of test-induced errors. "Too less" testing can lead to the valves failure, which in a result could have major consequences in relation to safety and long downtime during repairs. There are a number of test methods (differential pressure test, partial stroke testing etc.) used for different safety critical valves, because Valve design, the consequences of downtime, environmental aspects of the testing, etc. varies between different safety critical valves. The choice of inappropriate test regimes can lead to unnecessary downtime and environmental emissions in testing.

In addition to imperfect and partial proof tests, the system can also be subject to proof testing with short <b>test</b> <b>intervals</b> (intervals in the order of two or three weeks).

Factors that influenced HBR included calendar time, herd size, number of cattle tested, the test type, the inter-test interval and spatial grouping of farms. Herd tests other than routine herd tests had {{an increased risk of}} HBR in all four counties. In all counties, the risk of HBR increased with calendar time and in Shropshire a <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> of 3 years was associated with an increased risk of HBR compared with a 1 -year <b>test</b> <b>interval.</b> In Staffordshire and Sussex, a 4 -year <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> was associated with a lower risk of HBR compared with a 1 -year <b>test</b> <b>interval.</b> There was no evidence of spatial clustering of HBR in West Glamorgan (equal spatial risk in a 15 - 30 km radius) and weak evidence of spatial clustering in Shropshire (7 - 15 km) and Sussex (5 - 10 km). In Staffordshire, there was evidence of spatial (2 - 4 km) and time (3 - 4 years) clustering of HBR. The locally increased rate of testing following a confirmed HBR increased the detection of infected herds but did not prevent local spread in two of the four counties (Shropshire and Staffordshire) since the rate of HBR increased linearly from 1988 to 2000.

40|$|Two general {{classes of}} {{models have been}} {{proposed}} to account for how people process temporal information in the milliseconds range. Dedicated models entail a mechanism in which time is explicitly encoded; examples include clock–counter models and functional delay lines. Intrinsic models, such as state-dependent networks (SDN), represent time as an emergent property {{of the dynamics of}} neural processing. An important property of SDN is that the encoding of duration is context dependent since the representation of an interval will vary {{as a function of the}} initial state of the network. Consistent with this assumption, duration discrimination thresholds for auditory intervals spanning 100  ms are elevated when an irrelevant tone is presented at varying times prior to the onset of the <b>test</b> <b>interval.</b> We revisit this effect in two experiments, considering attentional issues that may also produce such context effects.

We {{sought to}} compare the {{accuracy}} of biphasic and ischemic responses and sustained improvement for reversible dysfunction and to identify causes of false negative and false positive findings. Background. Previous {{studies have shown that}} low dose dobutamine echocardiography was accurate for detecting reversible dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI) but did not determine whether accuracy was improved by peak dose findings or influenced by the <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> or clinical or angiographic factors. Methods. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (DASE) (baseline, low dose [5 and 10 μg/kg body weight per min] and peak dose) and coronary angiography were performed in 115 patients 2 to 7 days after MI (<b>test</b> <b>interval).</b> Segmental wall thickening was analyzed according to the 16 -segment model. Sustained improvement and biphasic and ischemic responses included improved wall thickening at low and peak doses, improved wall thickening at the low dose with worsening at peak dose and no change in wall thickening at the low dose with worsening at peak dose, respectively. Follow-up echocardiography was performed at 4 to 8 weeks, and reversible dysfunction was defined as improved wall thickening. Results. Wall thickening improved at follow-up in 305 (44 %) of 688 dysfunctional segments. The <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> was 2 days in 16 patients, 3 days in 24, 4 days in 24, 5 days in 12, 6 days in 16 and 7 days in 23. No change at low and peak doses accurately predicted fixed dysfunction (318 [88 %] of 360 segments), especially in akinetic and dyskinetic segments (276 [91 %] of 303), irrespective of the <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> or clinical and angiographic factors. Ischemic segmental responses also predicted fixed dysfunction (63 % [12 of 19 patients]), especially in medically treated compared with revascularized patients (100 % [8 of 8] vs. 36 % [4 of 11], p = 0. 013). Both biphasic responses and sustained improvement (77 % [179 of 231 segments] vs. 87 % [84 of 97], p = 0. 082) were highly predictive of reversible dysfunction, especially in akinetic segments, irrespective of the <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> or clinical and angiographic factors. The only limitation was reduced accuracy (77 % [177 of 222 segments], p < 0. 001) due to false positive results (16 %) in hypokinetic segments. Conclusions. No change and ischemic responses during DASE were specific for fixed dysfunction.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} high incidence areas of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain (GB) raises {{a number of}} questions concerning the determinants of infection at the herd level that are driving spread of the disease. Here, we develop risk factor models to quantify the importance of herd sizes, cattle imports from Ireland, history of bTB, badgers and cattle restocking in determining bTB incidence. We compare the significance of these different risk factors in high and low incidence areas (as determined by parish <b>testing</b> <b>intervals).</b> Results Large herds and fattening herds are more likely to breakdown in all areas. In areas with lower perceived risk (longer <b>testing</b> <b>intervals),</b> the risk of breaking down is largely determined by the number of animals that a herd buys in from high incidence areas. In contrast, in higher perceived risk areas (shorter <b>testing</b> <b>intervals),</b> the risk of breakdown is defined by the history of disease and the probability of badger occurrence. Despite differences in the management of bTB across different countries of GB (England, Wales and Scotland), we found no significant differences in bTB risk at the national level after these other factors had been taken into account. Conclusions This paper demonstrates that different types of farm are at risk of breakdown and that the most important risk factors vary according to bTB incidence in an area. The results suggest that significant gains in bTB control could be made by targeting herds in low incidence areas that import the greatest number of cattle from high incidence areas. </p...|$|R

40|$|A method with best {{prediction}} {{properties that}} condenses information from all test days into measures of lactation yield and persistency {{has been proposed}} as a possible replacement for the <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> method and projection factors. The proposed method uses previously established correlations between individual test days and includes inversion of a matrix for each lactation. Milk weights that were representative of monthly, a. m. [...] p. m., and trimonthly test plans were examined to compare the accuracy of best prediction and <b>test</b> <b>interval</b> methods for estimating lactation yield. Individual milk weights or daily yields of 658 Canadian cows in 17 herds were selected to correspond to test intervals for 100, 000 US cows. For a. m. [...] p. m. testing, the initial milk weight that was credited was selected randomly from the a. m. or p. m. milking and was alternated thereafter. Trimonthly credits were {{from one of the}} first three designated test day weights, selected randomly, and each third designated test [...] ...|$|E
30|$|The {{implementation}} {{was based}} on a fully connected test assignment, i.e., each node tests all others. To be considered recommended, the tested process must reply correctly and within the time interval defined by the recommendation threshold. At the end of a <b>testing</b> <b>interval,</b> if a tester has detected events in which at least one process is considered to be non-recommended, it reliably broadcasts the information to the other processes.|$|R

The key to our results is an efficient parallel algorithm for finding a perfect elimination ordering...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} for testers: reduce the <b>testing</b> <b>interval</b> without reducing quality. One answer: {{find a new}} way to approach test design and test generation. This paper will discuss an ongoing Lucent Technologies experiment in automated test generation from a behavioral model of the software product under test. Results indicate that our new approach can increase the effectiveness of our testing while reducing the cost of test design and generation...|$|R
