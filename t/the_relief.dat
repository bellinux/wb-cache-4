5|$|The {{final stage}} of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> effort took place between 12 and 25October. The {{remaining}} elements of the 70th Division were transported into Tobruk and the remaining Australian garrison (save the 2/13th Battalion and elements of the 2/15th Battalion) were shipped out. In total, <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> effort evacuated 47,280 men (including prisoners) and brought in 34,113 men; it also brought the garrison's armour strength to 126 tanks. On 22October, the 32nd Army Tank Brigade {{was attached to the}} 70th Division. With <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> effort over, command of the garrison was given to Scobie. Investing Tobruk were some German infantry and the Italian 27th Infantry Division Brescia, 25th Infantry Division Bologna, 17th Infantry Division Pavia, and 102nd Motorised Division Trento.|$|E

5000|$|Although a {{minority}} of researchers suggest that <b>the</b> <b>reliefs</b> are of fighters, perhaps hurling stones, the strong consensus is that they portray ballplayers.

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1633, <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> force, led {{personally}} by the king and numbering about 25,000 (20,000 in the Polish-Lithuanian army, according to Jasienica), arrived near Smolensk; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633. By {{the first days of}} September, the main body of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines, freeing the Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> Party turned its {{attention}} to the gubernatorial election of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E

In both settings, <b>the</b> <b>reliefs</b> define clusters sub-perpendicular to the regional contours, possibly indicating an origin related to escape of fluids from an impregnated unit {{at the base of}} the late-Holocene wedge.

5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> and the skills of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of the lower courts.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} focusses on de spatial {{context of}} <b>the</b> wall <b>reliefs</b> in <b>the</b> Northwest Palace of Assurnasirpal II, at Nimrud. This palace {{was built by}} Assurnasirpal II as the administrative centre of the new capital of the empire {{at the beginning of}} the 9 th century B. C. While doing so, the capital was moved from Assur to Nimrud. 	A lot of research has been done on Neo-Assyrian palaces, which often focusses on <b>the</b> wall <b>reliefs</b> that decorated <b>the</b> rooms of the palace. However, <b>the</b> wall <b>reliefs</b> have mainly been investigated in isolation. Especially the iconography of the images and their meaning have gotten a lot of attention. For example, images of hunting and war scenes are often associated with propaganda. However, to be able to make a statement about the meaning of these images, it is necessary to look at the context of these <b>reliefs.</b> <b>The</b> palace – and the rooms in the palace itself – were not accessible for everyone, and a great distinction can be made between the public and private quarters of the palace. 	In order to investigate the spatial context of <b>the</b> wall <b>reliefs,</b> <b>the</b> images on <b>the</b> <b>reliefs,</b> written sources, and reconstructions of the positions of <b>the</b> <b>reliefs</b> have been used. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>reliefs</b> in each room, de locations of these rooms in de palace, and the images on <b>the</b> <b>reliefs</b> have been investigated. One can recognise different themes on the images: war scenes, hunting scenes, the bringing of tribute to the king, and religious scenes.
