5|$|Allied {{planners}} envisaged {{preceding the}} sea-borne landings with airborne drops: near Caen {{on the eastern}} flank to secure the Orne River bridges, and north of Carentan on the western flank. The initial goal was <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Carentan, Isigny, Bayeux, and Caen. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen {{in order to protect the}} American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the Avranches-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Manila.

MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the city.|$|E

5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area. Failure <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided that the only way <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
