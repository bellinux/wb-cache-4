Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole.

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where}} it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{an opinion}} {{delivered}} by Justice Powell, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, saying that “where the statute expressly entrusts the Secretary {{with the responsibility}} for implementing a provision by regulation, review is limited <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary’s statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.” The Court decided that even where an agency's enabling statute expressly required that it hold a hearing, the agency could rely on its rulemaking authority <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> issues that didn't require case-by-case considerations.|$|R

As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity. In April 2011, Perrin-Johnson resigned her position.|$|E

With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.|$|E

The problem is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> complete graph [...] is biplanar (it is not, and the conjecture is true).

Most ethnic community leaders of Sabah, namely, Mustapha Harun representing the native Muslims, Donald Stephens representing the non-Muslim natives, and Khoo Siak Chew representing the Chinese, would eventually support the union. After discussion culminating in the Malaysia Agreement and 20-point agreement, on 16 September 1963 North Borneo (as Sabah) was united with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore, to form the independent Federation of Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, {{all of the}} thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E
