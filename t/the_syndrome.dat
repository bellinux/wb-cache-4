5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> itself, {{it is hard}} to {{determine}} whether certain additional diseases are actually part of <b>the</b> <b>syndrome.</b> With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with <b>the</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Although fully penetrant, since <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of <b>the</b> <b>syndrome,</b> while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven.

40|$|Both preeclampsia and <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome</b> {{have their}} {{origin in the}} placenta. The aim {{of this study is to}} review genetic factors {{involved}} in development of preeclampsia and <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome</b> using literature search in PubMed. A familial cohort links chromosomes 2 q, 5 q, and 13 q to preeclampsia. The chromosome 12 q is coupled with <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome.</b> <b>The</b> STOX 1 gene, the ERAP 1 and 2 genes, the syncytin envelope gene, and the − 670 Fas receptor polymorphisms are involved in the development of preeclampsia. The ACVR 2 A gene on chromosome 2 q 22 is also implicated. The toll-like receptor- 4 (TLR- 4) and factor V Leiden mutation participate both in development of preeclampsia and <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome.</b> Carriers of <b>the</b> TT and the CC genotype of the MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism seem to have an increased risk of <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome.</b> <b>The</b> placental levels of VEGF mRNA are reduced both in women with preeclampsia and in women with <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome.</b> <b>The</b> BclI polymorphism is engaged in development of <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome</b> but not in development of severe preeclampsia. The ACE I/D polymorphism affects uteroplacental and umbilical artery blood flows in women with preeclampsia. In women with preeclampsia and <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome</b> several genes in the placenta are deregulated. Preeclampsia and <b>the</b> HELLP <b>syndrome</b> are multiplex genetic diseases...|$|R
5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. <b>The</b> <b>syndrome,</b> eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Asperger's was {{estimated}} to affect 37.2 million people globally. <b>The</b> <b>syndrome</b> is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited understanding of others' feelings, and were physically clumsy. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went {{through a period of}} popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA). Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.|$|E
40|$|Several {{investigators}} {{have suggested that}} <b>the</b> Marshall <b>syndrome</b> and <b>the</b> Weaver <b>syndrome</b> are one entity because of some phenotypic overlap. This paper reviews the findings in nine additional patients with <b>the</b> Marshall <b>syndrome</b> and concludes that <b>the</b> <b>syndromes</b> are two distinct entities. In <b>the</b> Marshall <b>syndrome</b> there is a characteristic facies, failure to thrive in terms of height, weight, and psychomotor development, and early death. In the Weaver syndome the infants thrive too well: weight and heights are much above normal. They also have increased bifrontal diameters, hypertonia, prominent finger pads, and thin, deep-set nails, and the face {{is quite different from}} the Marshall facies...|$|R

5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with <b>the</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. <b>The</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months.

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with <b>the</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{suggested}} <b>the</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{may be an}} inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus Nosema apis.
