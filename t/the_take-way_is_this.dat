Portugal, the sixth European country where <b>this</b> disease <b>is</b> more prevalent, expends 3, 5 % of the annual health budget with this pathology. Characterization of the obese children followed in the pediatric outpatient clinic. A twelve year cohort study who comprehended 482 kids, analysing demographic variables; family and social backgrounds; personal backgrounds; habits; body mass index (BMI); comorbidities; blood tests; clinical intervention and follow-up. A positive family history with, at least, two obese elements was found in 64 %, of the 246 boys (51 %) and 236 girls (49 %) analysed. We observed a 93 % rate of eutocic delivery for an average birth weight of 3585 gr. These children were exclusively breastfeed for, at least, four months, in 38 % of the cases. In our sample, we found {{an average of three}} meals per day, with an 81 % rate of <b>take-way.</b> <b>The</b> absence of a regular physical activity plan was observed in 89 % of the sample. Anthropometric evaluation and counselling about healthy habits were focused through all appointments. For a follow-up of 16 months (+/- 7 months), a 10 % success rate was obtained, with an 1, 22 BMI reduction. We verified a 20 % dismissed rate, averagely occurring in the first 12 months (+/- 3 months). On the whole, the characterization of our sample seems to be according to the children obesity literature. Trough out follow-up, commitment to the interventional schedule was critical for life-style modification and desirable BMI achievement. Regular appointments and periodic evaluation of the results seems to be reliable strategies in the fight of this epidemic disease.
