2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} <b>turning</b> <b>bolt.</b> [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder.

2500|$|In {{the first}} set of service trials, the naval small arms board tested several submissions, {{including}} the Van Patten, Daudeteau, Briggs-Kneeland, Miles, the Russell-Livermore Magazine Rifle, five Remington turnbolt designs (all with side-mounted magazines), and the Lee straight-pull. [...] In a second set of trials the Model 1893/94 Luger 6-mm Rifle and the Durst rifle were also considered, along with a Lee turning-bolt design. [...] The Durst prototype fractured the receiver in firing and was withdrawn from the test, while the Luger Rifle performed excellently. [...] Luger's submission had only one major disadvantage: it failed to meet government specifications, having been chambered in a non-standard rimless 6mm cartridge. [...] The Lee <b>turning</b> <b>bolt</b> design was considered to be a good one, but marred by its magazine system, which the Small Arms Board found to be problematic. [...] The Board thought so highly of the Luger Rifle that it recommended purchase of either a prototype or an option to purchase the rights to manufacture. [...] Apparently this never came to pass, as Luger not only declined to submit its design in the Navy's government 6mm chambering, but withdrew from the third round of the service trials. [...] The Lee straight-pull rifle with its charger-loaded magazine was chosen as the winner in repeated small arms trials, and was selected for adoption by the U.S. Navy in 1895 as the Lee Rifle, Model of 1895, caliber 6-mm, a.k.a. the M1895 Lee Navy.|$|E

50|$|Paul's first {{invention}} was {{a cannon}} and its ammunition. His {{ability to produce}} both the gun and the ammunition for it was followed during his entire career and made him unique in this ability. Following {{the success of the}} Dreyse needle gun Paul turned his energies to improving on that design and producing a new one. Paul and Wilhelm had separated due to differences during this time. After Paul developed a new <b>turning</b> <b>bolt</b> design Wilhelm was impressed enough to rejoin the business and succeeded in obtaining the financing to purchase machinery and continue development. While the original needle gun used a pin that pierced the base of the cartridge to ignite the primer in the middle Mauser soon developed a needle that ignited the charge at the base, a superior design.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{manufacturers}} were solicited for prototype designs: Gustloff-Werke, Mauser, Johannes Großfuß Metall- und Lackierwarenfabrik, C.G. Hänel, Rheinmetall-Borsig and Heinrich Krieghoff Waffenfabrik. Several contracts {{were awarded}} {{but only a}} few prototypes are known to have been submitted. Mauser offered a version of the MG 81 (rejected due to excessive weight and its belt-fed operation) while Krieghoff presented a rising-block prototype, which too was quickly dropped. A design credited to Rheinmetall-Borsigs Louis Stange of Sömmerda proved satisfactory and underwent military trials conducted by the GL/C E-6 test station at Tarnewitz in mid-1942. This early prototype, known under the factory designation Gerät 450 ("device 450") or Ausführung [...] "A" [...] ("type A"), was intended to be a pure sheet metal design, using pressed steel {{in the construction of the}} receiver, buttstock and corrugated handguard. The proposed system of operation was modeled on that used in World War I Lewis light machine gun, with a gas-operated <b>turning</b> <b>bolt</b> action geared to a spiral (clock-type) recoil spring. The type [...] "A" [...] was never produced beyond model form, but the basic design layout was retained for further development.|$|E

5000|$|Rather than a {{traditional}} wooden or polymer rifle stock, the AW {{is based on}} an aluminium chassis which extends {{the entire length of the}} stock. This chassis system is marketed as the Accuracy International Chassis System (AICS) and can be used for all Accuracy International rifles. All other components, including the receiver, are bolted directly to this chassis. Two hollow polymer [...] "half thumb-hole stock panels", usually coloured green, dark earth or black, are in <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to the chassis, creating a rugged, yet for its sturdiness comparatively light, weapon.|$|R
50|$|In the final, Adam Gemili {{seemed to}} get the best start, but flanked by the Jamaican uniforms, he was quickly {{swallowed}} up. Mid way into the <b>turn,</b> Usain <b>Bolt</b> had a clear lead. Coming off the <b>turn,</b> <b>Bolt</b> had several meters on the field. The winner determined, Bolt eased off and cruised across the finish in what would be a great time for any other human being, just a slow 200 for Bolt in 19.66.Coming off the turn about even with Gemili and Nickel Ashmeade, Warren Weir out in lane 7 separated from those two and gained significantly on the slowing Bolt, setting a personal best of 19.79.Taking a lesson from American teammate Wallace Spearmon who was vanquished in the semis, Curtis Mitchell spotted the field several meters then closed from dead last {{at the end of the}} turn to take the bronze. Gemili took a full dive at the finish to try to beat Ashmeade but still finished in fifth.|$|R
50|$|A belt trailer or self {{unloading}} belt trailer is a semi-trailer {{that uses}} either a chain and flap assembly or a continuous belt that runs lengthwise {{on the bottom}} of the trailer.

40|$|Low cost {{approaches}} to the design and fabrication of blades for a two-bladed 200 kW wind turbine were identified and {{the applicability of the}} techniques to larger and smaller blades was assessed. Blade tooling was designed and fabricated. Two complete blades and a partial blade for tool tryout were built. The patented TFT process was used to wind the entire blade. This process allows rapid winding of an axially oriented composite onto a tapered mandrel, with tapered wall thickness. The blade consists of a TFT glass-epoxy airfoil structure filament wound onto a steel root end fitting. The fitting is, in <b>turn,</b> <b>bolted</b> to a conical steel adapter section to provide for mounting attachment to the hub. Structural analysis, blade properties, and cost and weight analysis are described...|$|R
50|$|The {{track laying}} began on 2 September 2009 along a wide, grassy forest track. The track {{consisted}} of circular steel pipe of about 6mm wall thickness, welded to steel cross members {{which were in}} <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to wooden sleepers. One side was fitted with a steel spike to engage with the next section. Thus, it fitted together {{very much like a}} toy railway, using preassembled track sections which are either straight or of fixed curvature. The track laying operation looked a bit like a child’s train set on a large scale. The rails, with sleepers ready attached, came in sections - straight or curved to suit their position. The tube and pin joints fitted together exactly as do the rail sections of the toy set.|$|R

5000|$|Mannlicher's {{successful}} designs {{during his}} lifetime were his bolt-action rifles, both military and sporting, in both <b>turn</b> <b>bolt</b> and straight-pull actions. Mannlicher also developed several innovative semi-automatic handgun designs {{in the last decade}} of the 19th century. A measure of how far ahead of his time he was can be seen by looking at his experimental designs of semiautomatic rifles, developed at a time when ammunition was not suitable to function properly in such a weapon. Mannlicher began development in 1883 of an automatic rifle firing the 11mm Austrian Werndl, a black powder cartridge. [...] According to WHB Smith in [...] "Mauser, Walther and Mannlicher Firearms" [...] the Mannlicher 1885 became the inspiration for the M1 Garand and the Mannlicher 1900 with the 'short-stroke piston' became the inspiration for the M1 Carbine.|$|R
