25|$|By definition, {{condensation}} liberates a small molecule, such {{as water}} or alcohol. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules {{by the process of}} polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or macromolecule) formed from hundreds or <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> called monomers. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of silicon alkoxide, for instance, can lead to complex branching of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)4 is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups (ligands) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol-gel science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Graduation became {{ranked as}} the 15th highest sales week for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began {{tracking}} data in 1991, {{as well as}} the highest sales week {{at the time of its}} release for an album since 50 Cent's The Massacre (2005). It also set the record for the largest week of an album digitally downloaded, registering over 133,000 paid downloads, beating Maroon 5's previous set record of 102,000 for It Won't Be Soon Before Long. Graduations first week sales of 957,000 and Curtiss first week sales of 691,000 marked only the second time ever since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan that two albums debuted within the same week with totals surpassing 623,000 copies in the United States. The first occurrence of such an event was in September 1991, when Guns N' Roses conjunctively released Use Your Illusion I, which sold 685,000 copies, and Use Your Illusion II, which sold 770,000 copies. The first week sales totals of Graduation and Curtis have outsold the first week sales totals of Guns N' Roses' two albums. 50 Cent showed graciousness in regards to his defeat. In a statement released to the Associated Press, he said, [...] "I am very excited to have participated in one of the biggest album release weeks in the last two years. Collectively, we have sold hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> in our debut week. This marks a great moment for hip-hop music, one that will go down in history." [...] After years of slumping sales, the album competition between the two releases and the resulting record breaking performances both albums demonstrated was considered to be a [...] "fantastic day for hip-hop".|$|E
