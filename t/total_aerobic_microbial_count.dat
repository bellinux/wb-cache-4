40|$|This study {{investigated}} the capability of three rapid microbiological methods to detect microorganisms in aseptically prepared pharmacy preparations at National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom. BacT/ALERT 3 D (bioMerieux), AKuScreen (Celsis), and BactiFlow ALS (AES Chemunex) technologies were used to detect levels of microorganisms in pharmaceutical products. Four products selected to represent the range of pharmaceuticals prepared in National Health Service hospital pharmacy departments were spiked with known levels of microorganisms. The presence of microorganisms in these products was then determined using each of the rapid microbiological methods and compared to the number determined by traditional <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> methodology. An evaluation of the performance parameters associated {{with each of the}} methods, including cost analysis, was also undertaken. There was good correlation between rapid microbiological methods and <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> for heparin and parenteral nutrition products. The rapid microbiological methods had difficulty recovering Gram-positive organisms from vancomycin and methotrexate products; however, protocol developments demonstrated that this was surmountable. The main differences between the rapid microbiological method systems were time-to-result, the initial equipment cost, and the skill required to operate the instruments. The main finding from this work is that rapid microbiological methods can detect microbial contamination of hospital pharmaceutical products in a reduced time when compared to traditional microbiological techniques. The instrument comparison showed that Celsis AKuScreen provided the most rapid result for detecting bacteria; BacT/ALERT was the least expensive instrument and the simplest system to use; and BactiFlow ALS was the most expensive and more complex to use and gave intermediate time to results...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether copper incorporated into hospital ward furnishings and equipment can reduce their surface microbial load. Design. A crossover study. Setting. Acute care medical ward with 19 beds {{at a large}} university hospital. Methods. Fourteen types of frequent-touch items made of copper alloy were installed in various locations on an acute care medical ward. These included door handles and push plates, toilet seats and flush handles, grab rails, light switches and pull cord toggles, sockets, overbed tables, dressing trolleys, commodes, taps, and sink fittings. Their surfaces and those of equivalent standard items on the same ward were sampled once weekly for 24 weeks. The copper and standard items were switched over after 12 weeks of sampling to reduce bias in usage patterns. The <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> {{and the presence of}} indicator microorganisms were determined. Results. Eight of the 14 copper item types had <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> on their surfaces that were significantly lower than counts on standard materials. The other 6 copper item types had reduced microbial numbers on their surfaces, compared with <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> on standard items, but the reduction did not reach statistical significance. Indicator microorganisms were recovered from both types of surfaces; however, significantly fewer copper surfaces were contaminated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms, compared with standard surfaces. Conclusions. Copper alloys (greater than or equal to 58 % copper), when incorporated into various hospital furnishings and fittings, reduce the surface microorganisms.

Approaches to reducing environmental microbial contamination in addition to cleaning are thus worthy of consideration. Copper is well recognised as having antimicrobial activity but this property has not been applied to the clinical setting. We explored its use in a novel cross-over study on an acute medical ward. A toilet seat, set of tap handles and a ward entrance door push plate each containing copper were sampled {{for the presence of}} micro-organisms and compared to equivalent standard, non-copper-containing items on the same ward. Items were sampled once weekly for 10 weeks at 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. After five weeks, the copper-containing and non-copper-containing items were interchanged. The <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> per cm 2 including the presence of ‘indicator micro-organisms’ were determined. Median numbers of microorganisms harboured by the copper-containing items were between 90 % and 100 % lower than their control equivalents at both 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. This reached statistical significance for each item with one exception. Based on the median <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> cfu counts from the study period, five out of ten control sample points and zero out of ten copper points failed proposed benchmark values of a <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> count of < 5 cfu/cm 2.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the protective effects of gamma irradiation against postharvest insect damage and microbial contamination {{and its effect}} on the nutritive value of adlay (Coix lacryma-jobi L.). Adlay was treated with doses of 0 - 20 kGy gamma irradiation and subsequently stored at ambient temperature. The number of insects, microbial quality and chemical properties of irradiated and non-irradiated adlay were evaluated immediately after treatment and after 6 months of storage. Before irradiation, <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> ranged from 5. 6 x 10 (2) to 1. 4 x 10 (5) CFUg(- 1) and the mean total number of insects was 3. 2 +/- 2. 1 per 100 g of polished kernel. Two kilograys was the lowest dose that provided 100 % insect control. A radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans RC 1, was found in 2 of 10 adlay samples. Four kilograys was a sufficient dose for Enterobacteriaceae inactivation, and 6 kGy was a sufficient dose for yeast and fungi inactivation. Twenty and 8 kGy sufficed for the inactivation of all mesophilic microbes in samples with and without D. radiodurans, separately. Moreover the moisture, ash, crude fiber, crude fat, crude protein and riboflavin content all remained constant. However, 8 kGy irradiation reduced vitamin B 1 concentration by 24. 2 %, but did not measurably reduce the amount of amino acids, except methionine and cysteine. Fatty acid contents did not alter after 8 kGy irradiation, but changes were observed after the 6 months of storage. These changes caused by irradiation were no greater than those caused by the 6 -month storage. Irradiation up to 8 kGy did not markedly increase the acid value, but did increase the peroxide value to 13 % of the initial value right after irradiation. However, significant changes in acid value and peroxide value were noted after 6 months of storage both in non-irradiated and post-irradiated storage samples. Additionally, 8 kGy irradiation did not significantly change the adlay appearance. The improvement in the hygiene of this vital food source compensates for the small loss of some nutritional constituents. Hence 8 kGy of gamma irradiation can be used in cold decontamination of adlay to prolong shelf-life, to improve postharvest quality, and {{to reduce the risk of}} food-borne disease.

Moreover,the microflora were examined to study whether possible changes in bile salt concentration coincide with alterations in microbial numbers. Carboxymethylcellylose depressed apparent lipid digestibility (P = 0. 021). Feed intake and weight gain were not significantly:affected. Water intake was increased in birds fed the CMC diet (P = 0. 039). Bile acid concentration in small intestinal digests was decreased (P = 0. 047) in birds fed the CMC diet, which may have been caused by the increased water content of digesta (P < 0. 001). The concentration of bile acids per gram dry matter or per milligram chromium was not reduced in small. intestinal contents. Broiler chickens fed the CMC diet excreted more bile acids in the excreta (P < 0. 001). <b>Total</b> <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> in the intestinal digesta were Significantly increased in the duodenum plus jejunum (P = 0. 038) but not in the ileum.

40|$|Teat {{cleaning}} before milking {{is necessary}} to protect the milk from microbial contamination resulting from dirt. For this reason, the commission directive 89 / 362 /EEC provides prerequisites on the cleanliness of the teats and udder before milking. Many studies have assessed the effects of various teat cleaning methods on milk quality. Teat cleaning is automated in automatic milking systems (AMS), with the disadvantage that testing {{of the effectiveness of}} the cleaning has, up to now, been impossible. The goal of this study was initially to develop a practical method for testing teat cleanliness. With the help of a suitable testing method, the effectiveness of different AMS teat cleaning systems was measured and it was examined whether differences exist in the effectiveness of teat cleaning in automated milking systems made by different manufacturers. For each of 6 AMS from different manufacturers, three farms employing that particular AMS were analyzed. Data were also collected at each farm using two methods {{to determine the extent to}} which hygiene management influenced teat cleanliness. In one method a questionnaire was designed which was then completed in an interview with the farm manager. In the other method, a check list was completed at the farm to determine hygiene status in various areas. A variance analysis was carried out to show which factors exerted an influence. This analysis included 45 questions from the questionnaire and 17 points from the check list. A sample was taken from each farm’s bulk milk tank in order to quantify possible deficiencies in milk quality. The <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> and the numbers of coliform and heat-stable microorganisms and staphylocci were determined for each sample. From each farm, a sample of fresh bedding material was also examined for bacterial contamination. The results can be summarised as follows: 1. 	The bacteriological status of bulk tank milk can reveal problems in milk quality and permit conclusions to be drawn as to the possible source of contamination. Such findings are helpful in addressing errors so that the total microbial count in the bulk tank milk does not climb above the critical maximum of 10 000 CFU/ml. A high coliform count in the bulk milk of eight of the farms suggested insufficient system hygiene and/or teat cleaning. Heat stable microbial counts at 14 farms exceeded 200 CFU/ml, indicating a problem in the automatic cleansing system, even though the total microbial count was clearly below 10 000 CFU/ml. However heat stable bacteria may also originate from the bedding material. 2. 	Differing amounts of bacterial contamination were found in fresh bedding material from the farms. The lowest total microbial counts were found in specially treated wood shavings and in sand. Coliform bacteria on the teats do not necessarily originate from fecal contamination since they also occurred in fresh bedding material. 3. 	The method developed to test teat cleanliness consisted of a visual examination of the teats before and after cleaning, sediment tests after cleaning and determination of total microbial count and ATP values in teat swabs taken before and after cleaning. 50 cows were examined at each of the eighteen farms included in this study. Two teats of each cow were examined using four procedures. Results showed that the ATP determination technique that was used as one of a combination of methods to determine teat cleanliness is a suitable procedure for demonstrating the effectiveness of teat cleaning on working farms. This analytic technique makes it possible to detect inadequate teat cleanliness and can thus reveal management errors at individual farms. 4. 	The results obtained with this combination of methods showed great variation both within one farm and between the individual farms. Furthermore, a variance analysis showed significant differences in effectiveness of 4 manufacturers’ teat cleaning systems compared to those of 2 other companies. In comparing the results of the individual methods (visual assessment, determination of microbial count and ATP) with regard to the effectiveness of teat cleaning, a ranking list of the manufacturers was created showing the differences. For only one manufacturer did the results differ within the method combination. The deviation can be explained by the fact that, for technical reasons, samples could not be taken directly after teat cleaning with this manufacturer’s device. In this case the cleaning effect found was influenced additionally by teat washing during milking. A variance analysis was conducted to determine the effects of manufacturer, farm and initial teat contamination on teat cleaning effectiveness. This revealed significant differences not only between the manufacturers but also between the individual farms employing the same AMS. In addition, the initial contamination before cleaning exerted a significant influence on the cleaning effectiveness. 5. 	Detailed evaluation of management factors from the questionnaire and additional checklist on udder and teat cleanliness revealed some large differences between farms. Differences between the 3 farms with the AMS of one manufacturer suggest that milk quality is substantially influenced by the farm’s management as well as by its equipment. For this reason management factors for ensuring clean teats before milking are also important, particularly as it can be assumed that improvements are possible. The results of this study could be used by the AMS manufacturers to improve their systems. 6. 	Management factors at the farms with AMS which show a connection with high levels of teat contamination are the changing of the cleaning unit once per year or less, poor condition of the teat cleaning unit, average cleaning frequency of 2. 5 times per day or less and no selection of cows according to robot acceptance. 7. 	Effects occurring independently of the presence of AMS, but significantly causing a high level of teat contamination, involved the management of cubicles. They included, in particular, the provision of less than one cubicle per cow, the presence of cows preferring to lie on slatted floors, the addition of bedding material less than once a day, no selection of cows according to udder health, moderate or poor bedding condition and moderate or poor hoof condition. 8. 	Particular attention must be paid to cows with mastitis as they can contaminate cubicles with high numbers of bacteria due to milk leakage. For this reason the selection of cows according to udder health would reduce the risk of cubicle contamination and is thus directly related to a low microbial count on the teats. Furthermore cows in AMS are at higher risk of milk leakage. This aspect of management should be a part of a mastitis control program promoting a cleaner environment as an additional measure. 9. 	The first impression of the robot, the cleaning frequency of the milking stalls, the hygienic status of the teat cups and the utilization of cow brushes in stalls are all factors depending on the general attitude of the farm manager towards hygiene and less on teat cleanliness. 10. 	The following management factors – practised by almost all the farm managers – can be seen as generally accepted parameters of hygiene: a twice daily cleaning of cubicle stalls, the shaving of the udder and the shortening of the tail tip. These factors should be the management basis to which other hygienic measures are added. It is to be expected that consideration of those factors which are connected to teat cleanliness, with the exception of AMS-specific factors such as frequency of changing the cleaning unit, will improve the teat cleanliness on farms using conventional milking systems to the same extent as on farms using automatic milking systems...|$|E

Heat inactivation studies {{indicated that the}} purified PME can be inactivated rapidly at 80 o and 90 oC. However, at or below 70 oC the enzyme showed activation by heating and inactivated very slowly. The in-situ activation of PME occurred much more extensively when sun-dried figs were rehydrated between 70 o and 90 oC to produce IM figs with approximately 30 % moisture and this prevented the effective inactivation of enzyme even by rehydrations conducted at 80 o and 90 oC. The partial reduction of PME enzyme activity (almost 30 %) by rehydration of figs at 80 oC for 16 min {{may be used to}} delay undesirable textural changes in cold stored IM figs for 3 months. However, for longer storage periods hot reyhdration alone is not sufficient to prevent softening. No considerable yeast and mold growth was detected in IM figs cold stored 3 - 3. 5 months. However, in some samples rehydrated in water at 80 oC, the <b>total</b> mesophilic <b>aerobic</b> counts and <b>total</b> yeast and mold counts showed a considerable increase when storage time exceeded 3 - 3. 5 months. The rehydration of IM figs in 2. 5 % H 2 O 2 for 16 min at 80 oC reduced the <b>total</b> mesophilic <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> of figs almost 90 %. Due to bleaching caused by H 2 O 2, the brown fig color turned to a desirable and stable yellowlight brown as well. However, during cold storage the O 2 gas released due to the decomposition of H 2 O 2 by in situ fig catalase, accumulated within figs and caused some physical defects. Also, the residual level of H 2 O 2 in the homogenates of disinfected figs was too much (300 ppm) and it seemed unlikely to eliminate this amount of H 2 O 2 by physical or chemical means during processing. Pureeing IM figs eliminated residual H 2 O 2 very rapidly. The application of rehydration first in 2. 5 % H 2 O 2 solution at 80 oC for 4 or 8 min and then in hot water at the same temperature for 12 or 8 min, respectively, also reduced the amount of residual H 2 O 2 in IM figs considerably. Besides, these two-stage rehydration procedures eliminated the physical defects occurred in IM figs due to O 2 gas release and gave firmer IM figs. To reduce the initial microbial load of IM figs, 4 and 8 min disinfections conducted in H 2 O 2 solutions were less effective than 16 min disinfection in H 2 O 2 solution. However, both 4 and 8 min disinfections effectively suppressed microbial load for at least 3. 5 months and they may be used in the production of SO 2 free light colored fig products...|$|R

Experiment two, consisting of one trial, utilized twelve 1. 8 x 3. 7 m (6 x 12 ft) pens to rear broilers to 42 d of age. Used litter was obtained from separate commercial broiler farms for each experiment and placed into the pens at an average depth of 11 cm (4. 3 in). Feed consumption and mortality were recorded for each pen for each trial. Ammonia production was measured by placing an enclosed chamber over the litter and measuring the headspace ammonia concentration after 20 minutes for both experiments. Experiment one also utilized a two minute ammonia flux technique. Ammonia measurements were taken at the time of litter treatment, at chick placement, and once per week {{for the remainder of the}} grow-out. Litter samples were collected at the same time and location as ammonia measurements. At the end of all trials, caked litter was removed from each pen, weighed and sampled.

The analysis comprised the results of microbiological purity tests performed before the products are marketed. Total of 1285 samples of non-sterile drugs manufactured by different pharmaceutical plants in Polish were taken into study. The microbiological quality of drugs was assessed in accordance with the criteria included in the European Pharmacopoeia (EP).

40|$|Trypticase ™ Soy Agar is {{a general}} purpose medium which {{supports}} {{the growth of a}} variety of bacteria and fungi. The Sterile Pack plates are useful for microbial load testing of environmentally-controlled areas, clean rooms, pharmaceuticals, and other instances when sterility of the medium is of importance. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The nutritional composition of the Trypticase Soy Agar base has made it a popular medium for many years. The medium is used for a multitude of purposes, including maintenance of stock cultures, <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts,</b> isolation of microorganisms from a variety of specimen types and as a base for media containing blood. 1 - 3 It is included in the compendia of methods for the examination of water, waterwaste and foods. 4, 5 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE The combination of casein and soy peptones in Trypticase Soy Agar renders the medium highly nutritious by supplying organic nitrogen, particularly amino acids and longer-chained peptides. The sodium chloride maintains the osmotic equilibrium. Because the entire double-bagged product is subjected to a sterilizing dose of gamma radiation, the contents inside the outer bag are sterile. 6 This allows the inner bag to be aseptically removed without introducing contaminants. Since the agar medium has been sterilized after packaging, the presence of microbial growth after sampling and incubation can be relied upon to represent true recovery and not pre-existing medium contamination...|$|R

Properties of all-beef patties containing 20 % fat and low-fat (10 %) beef patties containing water, carrageenan, encapsulated salt, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein with no additional additives (control) or with sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium ascorbate (SA), sodium lactate (SL), STPP and SA, or SL and SA were compared. Control low-fat patties had lower cooking yields than high- fat patties. STPP and SL improved cooking yields. The control low-fat patties were harder and springier than the high-fat patties and the additional additives did not have significant effects (p> 0. 05) on the texture of low-fat patties. Precooked, oxygen-permeable polyvinylchloride (PVC) -wrapped low-fat control patties and high-fat control patties had similar values of 2 -thiobarbituric acid(TBA) -reactive substances after 6 days of refrigerated storage, but the low-fat control patties had better flavor than high-fat patties when either freshly cooked or stored. STPP was an effective antioxidant and was synergistic with SA as measured by TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis and by sensory scores. SA alone reduced TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis, but did not significantly improve flavor. SL reduced TBA values on a sample weight basis in refrigerated patties, regardless of packaging method, and in frozen, vacuum-packaged patties, but increased the values on a fat weight basis in frozen, PVC-wrapped patties. SL had no effect on TBA values on a sample weight basis of precooked, PVC-wrapped frozen patties or on TBA values on a fat weight basis of precooked, vacuum-packaged frozen patties or of precooked, PVC-wrapped refrigerated patties. SL did not improve flavor, but the combination of SA and SL improved sensory scores of stored patties. Control low-fat patties and high-fat patties did not have significantly different <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> plate <b>counts.</b> SL and SA both had antimicrobial effects, but STPP did not affect <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> There was an increase in nonheme iron during refrigerated storage which was most pronounced in control low-fat patties.

40|$|Maximal {{shelf life}} was {{determined}} and microbial flora were compared for irradiated (0. 1 and 0. 2 Mrad) and nonirradiated yellow perch fillets stored at 1 C. Shelf life was estimated by organoleptic determinations. Microbiological studies included {{determination of the}} effects of irradiation on the <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> population, lag phase, and rate of growth. Genera of organisms isolated from fillets through the course of microbial spoilage were identified, and the proteolytic activity of the organisms was determined. Plate counts for fish prior to irradiation showed the presence of approximately 106 organisms per g of sample. Irradiation to 0. 1 and 0. 2 Mrad produced 1. 4 and 3 logarithm reductions of the initial count, respectively. Irradiation to 0. 1 and 0. 2 Mrad approximately doubled the product's shelf life. Organisms initially isolated from the nonirradiated fillets, in order of decreasing number, consisted of Flavobacterium, Micrococcus-Sarcina, Achromobacter-Alcaligenes-Mima, Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, Vibrio, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Brevibacterium, and Aeromonas. By the 6 th and 9 th days of fillet storage, Pseudomonas and the Achromobacter group were the predominant organisms. All members of the genus Flavobacterium, but not all members of the genus Pseudomonas, were proteolytically active on raw fish juice-agar and skim milk-agar media. The Achromobacter group was found to be nonproteolytic on both media. Residual flora of fillets irradiated to 0. 1 and 0. 2 Mrad consisted of the Achromobacter group, Lactobacillus, Micrococcus-Sarcina, and Bacillus. Their sequence in predominance, however, varied with dose level. Not all proteolytic bacteria in the fillets were eliminated by 0. 1 and 0. 2 Mrad; proteolytic Micrococcus-Sarcina survived these treatments...|$|R
40|$|Various {{chemical}} compounds {{contribute to the}} naturally pleasant flavor of milk. Over time, however, and with unwanted chemical reactions, loss of flavor is inevitable. This {{study was conducted to}} identify and quantify volatile flavor compounds associated with off-flavored and commercial reduced-fat milk products. Fresh milk was used for the preparation of altered milk samples having off-flavors such as “light-oxidized” and “high-acid. ” Milk lacking freshness (i. e., milk produced two weeks before sampling and maintained at 40 oF in the dark) also was compared with fresh unaltered milk and two commercial milk samples. For headspace analysis, milk samples were subjected to SPME-GC for volatile compound identification. In addition, the composition and <b>aerobic</b> and coliform <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> for all milk samples were analyzed. The milk samples did not differ in the concentrations of volatile flavor constituents. When comparing “light-oxidized” milk samples (200 lx exposure for 1 or 3 hr), 2 -butanone and pentanal concentrations tended to increase as light exposure time increased. All milk samples had similar fat and total solids contents. “High-acid” milk had a greater <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> microbe count than the other milk samples. Fresh milk had a greater octanal concentration than the offflavored reduced-fat milk samples did. This might indicate that octanal is an important contributor to fresh milk flavor and deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|In two turkey {{processing}} {{plants in the}} northwest of Germany, skin samples were taken at 4 different positions (prior to scalding, after plucking, before and during chilling), which {{was repeated three times}} per sampling day (two days). The scalding technique was different (steam respectively water scalding). Samples were examined for <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> plate count as a hygiene parameter and the zoonotic agents Salmonella and Campylobacter. The examinations followed § 35 LMBG, DIN 10113 - 1 and DIN-ISO DIS 10272. After identification, Salmonella and a selection of Campylobacter isolates were characterized using molecularbiological pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It was the aim of this study to reflect the influence of steam scalding on the microbiological status of the turkey skin compared to water scalding and the distribution of zoonotic agents under different scalding techniques. Scalding is generally recognised a a weak point in poultry processing. Scalding by steam {{is considered to be a}} potential alternative to water scalding. In abattoir one (water scalding), an average <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> plate count was obtained lg 4 and 5. No significant reduction of the <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> plate count during scalding and plucking was observed. In the end, the <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> at the chilling position was lower than in the beginning. In abattoir two (steam scalding), the <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> plate count was between lg 3, 63 and lg 7, 13. The <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> was lower after plucking than prior to scalding. A reduction of the <b>total</b> <b>aerobic</b> plate count was sometimes significant. However, during the following procedures the <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> increased. So in the end, steam scalding had no impact on the <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> underlining the importance of the complete processing line. In abattoir one (water scalding), 58 % of the samples were Salmonella positive. 6 Salmonella serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Indiana, S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, S. of Group B and S. Saintpaul) were recovered. No Salmonella was identified at the first position of sampling. 42 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive (C. jejuni und C. coli). In abattoir two (steam scalding), 22 % of the samples were Salmonella positive which were recovered at each of the 4 sampling sites. Salmonella serovars were S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg und S. Saintpaul. Altogether 89 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive at each sampling site: C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari were identified. The results of PFGE demonstrate, that both, Salmonella and Campylobacter strains are being transferred through the whole processing line demonstrating the lack of critical points with respect to both zoonotic agents. With respect to restrictive legislation on zoonotic agents in the near future, the poultry processing lines must become more safe with respect to bacterial transfer...|$|R

Non-sterile pharmaceutical productsneed not to be sterile but may contain low levels of microbial load during use. The pharmaceutical products prepared in pharmacies have the potential of contamination with different microorganisms, this is {{in part due to}} the unhygienic environment and also lack of a suitable preservative system. This is not the case with preparations manufactured in pharmaceutical factories. In this study 21 pharmaceutical items (including: tablets, suspensions, syrups, and capsules) were examined. The <b>aerobic</b> viable <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> and specific microorganisms per gram or mL of product were determined according to the British Pharmacopoeia, (2007) using pour plate method. All the examined samples immediately after purchase were found to have viable count of less than 10 2 cfu/g or mL. The objectionable organisms e. g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella species were not found. V The study demonstrated the possible quality and quantity of micro flora of the factory air that might be incriminated as a source of microbial contamination of the medical preparations. A review of the microbial identification methods that are available to support compendial testing was undertaken to determine {{the state of the art}} within the pharmaceutical industry. Emphasis was given to the preliminary screening of microbial isolates for the cellular morphology, staining, and diagnostic biochemical reactions to either characterize the micro-organisms or support decisions for using different microbial identification schemes and the rapid microbial identifications methods that are available.

40|$|AbstractAmong {{researchers}} worldwide, {{the combination}} of preservation methods aimed to achieve improved effects on microbial inactivation of seafood products {{is an area of}} research receiving increasing interest. Globally also, the demand for high quality minimally processed food products are on the increase. Ozone treatment, three decade – long declared ‘Generally Recognized As Safe’ and approved as food contact sanitizing agent has evolved up to recent times where it assumes the likes of domestic food-processing facilities manufactured with environment-friendly status ensuring consumer safety. On the other hand, the subject of inactivation kinetics of seafood microorganisms following ozone treatment is still under debate. Furthermore, kinetic models remain the economical and quick approach to predict the preservation parameters. Nevertheless, there is paucity of information regards <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> inactivation of crustacean product arising from fixed minimal ozone discharge. Is the phenomenon of <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> inactivation kinetics of shrimp product subject to a fixed minimal ozone discharge during iced storage a fact or fib? To answer this, the <b>aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> inactivation kinetics of shrimp during iced storage of up to 11 days was inspected. The process conditions comprised of a fixed ozone concentration of 100 mg/h minimally discharged at wash time of 1 min as well as iced storage of up to 11 days. Minimal ozone treatment was applied either prior to or during iced storage situations. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>microbial</b> inactivation presented significant effects during iced storage (P< 0. 05).

Frankfurters were inoculated after irradiation and stored aerobically for 4 wk at 4 ??C to simulate the product becoming contaminated after opening, or they were inoculated prior to vacuum packaging and stored for 8 wk at 4 ??C. Incorporation of lactate/diacetate into frankfurter formulations with or without irradiation had a strong listeriostatic effect throughout 4 wk of <b>aerobic</b> storage. <b>Total</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> for frankfurters formulated with lactate/diacetate remained constant throughout storage while those without increased steadily (5. 4 to 9. 3 log cfu). Over 4 wk of storage, the outgrowth of L. monocytogenes on frankfurters formulated with lactate/diacetate was effectively suppressed and counts {{were not significantly different}} from initial counts (5. 2 vs. 5. 0 log cfu, respectively). Irradiation treatments alone had significantly higher L. monocytogenes counts after 3 wk of storage. Both treatments together or alone were not detrimental to sensory aroma or flavor attributes. Meaty/brothy complex, smoke, spice aroma, springiness, and cohesiveness attributes were judged slightly lower for frankfurters formulated without lactate/diacetate than those with lactate/diacetate at the end of aerobic storage. Sensory color was not dramatically influenced by either treatment, however, L*a*b* values of all treatments decreased slightly during storage. Both the addition of lactate/diacetate to a frankfurter formulation and irradiation were effective towards controlling microbial growth of L. monocytogenes in an unopened vacuum package after 8 wk of storage. Large and incremental reductions in total <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> were seen with irradiation treatment, which were maintained throughout storage with lactate/diacetate treated frankfurters.
