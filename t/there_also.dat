5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s.

5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.

5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome.

It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many English dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional varieties {{that differ from}} each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.

It became a significant post for the New Model Army under William Waller. Bath was retaken by royalists following the Battle of Lansdowne fought on the northern {{outskirts of the city}} on 5 July 1643. Thomas Guidott, a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College, Oxford, set up a practice in the city in 1668. He was interested in the curative properties of the waters, and he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters <b>there.</b> <b>Also,</b> Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676.

5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus died on 10 October 644 at Rochester, {{where he}} {{was buried in the}} sacristy of the church. His {{successor}} at Rochester was Ithamar, the first Englishman consecrated to a Gregorian missionary see. After Paulinus' death, Paulinus was revered as a saint, with a feast day on 10 October. When a new church was constructed at Rochester in the 1080s his relics, or remains, were translated (ritually moved) to a new shrine. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> were shrines to Paulinus at Canterbury, and at least five churches were dedicated to him. Although Rochester held some of Paulinus' relics, the promotion of his cult there appears to have occurred after the Norman Conquest. He is considered a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905.

However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, <b>there</b> <b>also</b> emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
