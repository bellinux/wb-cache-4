5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> or rape of {{a mortal}} woman {{by a male}} god, {{resulting}} in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{team was}} largely that which had opposed the Claimant {{in the civil}} case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew, both future judges. The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; he would not reengage Ballantine, and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew {{they would have to}} present evidence concerning <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers. Other key witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, likewise would not give evidence at the criminal trial.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 2009, {{the band}} premiered the radio musical <b>The</b> <b>Seduction</b> of Ingmar Bergman, {{commissioned}} by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsjö, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, {{tells the story of}} Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with Smiles of a Summer Night (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking <b>The</b> <b>Seduction</b> of Ingmar Bergma with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director Guy Maddin.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{continued}} {{to appear in}} films of the 1970s-80s, including Freaky Friday with a young Jodie Foster, Movie Movie for director Stanley Donen, and The North Avenue Irregulars with Edward Herrmann and Cloris Leachman.

The show was held at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. The group showcased at the film festival in their quest for funding for the feature film version. The performance garnered glowing reviews from journals such as The Huffington Post, the LA Times, the LA Weekly, and LA Record.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} de Romieu’s Brief Discourse and Estienne’s Paradoxes {{can be found}} within the author’s voice. Marie de Romieu’s is distinctly a woman’s voice, showcasing true indignity {{at the idea that}} it is women who lead men astray. She proceeds to thoroughly develop on the notion that men are at fault, attempting to seduce women with their wily ways. De Romieu then accuses them of blaming guileless women for <b>the</b> <b>seduction</b> they impose upon their innocence. She attributes the injustice to man’s ignorance, comparing him to a “cock who cannot distinguish between a pearl and a stone”. Furthermore, while Estienne’s audience was primarily masculine, de Romieu speaks to multiple audiences. She addresses women, including herself, as “us, women” and “we, my ladies”, as well as a universal and neutral “one”. She utilizes those when presenting dialogue in which a masculine voice presents arguments that are subsequently countered by her own female voice.|$|E
