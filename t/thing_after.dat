Mera states that she knows who he is, and after she tells him, Aquaman leaves, and rescues Jackson from a Xebel attack. It is revealed that Aquaman's Silver Age origin has been re-established and he is once again the half-human son of Tom Curry and an Atlantean queen. The Entity subsequently reduces Aquaman to {{what appears to be}} white water. Aquaman is revealed {{to be one of the}} Elementals, and was transformed by the Entity to become the element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp <b>Thing.</b> <b>After</b> the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing returns Aquaman to normal. Afterward, Aquaman is reunited with Mera, at which point he discovers that the Xebels' weapons were made of Atlantean technology.|$|E

500|$|For The King of Fighters XIII, K's {{design was}} crafted {{so that he}} had a [...] "cool" [...] appearance. Developers liked the result as his moves, such as putting on his sunglasses, were {{carefully}} detailed. His gameplay mechanics were developed so that gamers who had used him before would not find his new gameplay mechanics strange. In contrast to Kyo's flames, K's were designed with intention of making them look more violent. As a result of various The King of Fighters endings showing K' removing his red glove, a special move was required to show him doing the same <b>thing.</b> <b>After</b> thinking of several methods that would show this, the staff was inspired by The King of Fighters HK Comics printed adaptations in which the character's glove once broke after defeating his opponent, leading to his winpose that happens only after he has used his strongest technique. Following various revisions of K's [...] technique, in order to better follow the material that inspired the move, the staff decided to make K' fight while wearing his sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God wants you to say". They also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether [...] "people are going to like it". Ultimately, Hall [...] "absorbed" [...] the feedback their first record had received, using it as inspiration. Lifesong focuses mainly on the [...] "truth-can-be-a-tough-pill-to-swallow message" [...] that [...] "there are broken people within arm’s reach of the church, {{and if there is}} any hope of healing, it begins with people who will be the hands and feet of Jesus". Hall responded to critics who felt the band's material was [...] "preaching to the choir" [...] by saying [...] "How can writing songs that challenge the church, songs that ask Christians to consider their actions, be a bad <b>thing?</b> <b>After</b> all, it’s the message that matters...

500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E

500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{approach}} to resolving the problem {{relies on a}} distinction between [...] "proximate" [...] and [...] "non-proximate" [...] matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word [...] "body" [...] {{to refer to the}} matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this [...] "body" [...] remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same body after its death, he is using the word [...] "body" [...] to refer to the fully organized body, which (according to this interpretation) does not remain the same <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> death.|$|E
