25|$|In 1913 the {{property}} was reopened {{as one of the}} first guest ranches in Arizona. Named the Garden of Allah due to the location's resemblance to the locale in a popular romantic novel of the time with that title. Its visitors were offered a true experience of a Western ranch. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> were hauled in from nearby Castle Hot Springs on wagons. Over the years it saw several other uses such as a campground.|$|E

25|$|By nightfall, the Dutch {{bombardment}} {{had managed}} to significantly damage the bastion of Santiago. Their shots penetrated the weaker sections of the wall (near the main gate) and entered the fort. The Portuguese, {{with the help of}} the inhabitants, began to repair the fortifications. All <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> within the fort were cut down and they were laid over the bastion of Santiago and the damaged sections. These repairs were made under continuous cannon fire and their effectiveness was noted even by the Dutch commanders.|$|E
25|$|Date palms are {{cultivated}} in Sudan from the Egyptian {{border in the}} North all the way along the Nile south of Khartoum until Sennar. In addition to {{the banks of the}} Nile, isolated occurrences of cultivated date trees occur in the Red Sea Hills in the vicinity of Port Sudan, in Kassala, along the Atbara River, in the deserts around Dongola and far Southwest in Darfur, for example in Wadi Kutum, Wadi Mellit and Barra. In all these locations, <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> depend on accessible ground water or on irrigation. The water for irrigation is either taken from wells or from the river Nile, where it is nowadays provided by diesel pumps.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Tadmor" [...] {{is known}} from the early second {{millennium}} BC; eighteenth century BC tablets from Mari written in cuneiform record the name as [...] "Ta-ad-mi-ir", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as Ta-ad-mar. Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; TDMR (i.e. Tadmar) and TDMWR (i.e. Tadmor). The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by Albert Schultens, connects it to the Semitic word for [...] "date palm", tamar (...) , thus referring to <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> that surrounded the city.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{the large}} napalm {{explosion}} in the opening scene of the film required a 450-foot (137-meter) row of explosive pots containing 1,100gallons (4,165liters) of gasoline and diesel fuel. All <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> used in the explosion were moved to the specific location after the crew determined {{the impact of the}} lighting and necessary camera angles. Due to the size and cost of the 1.25-second explosion, it was only performed once and was captured by twelve cameras. For the safety of the crew and cast, the detonators were added onehour before the explosion and nobody was allowed to be within [...] during detonation. The explosion was made up of twelveindividual explosions and resulted in a mushroom cloud that reached [...] in the air. For the scene in the film, Danny McBride's character, Cody Underwood, was the only actor shown in the shot of the explosion. All the other characters were added digitally. The explosion of the bridge in one of the final scenes used nine cameras to capture the shot, and the crew was required to be [...] away for their safety.|$|E
500|$|Late on August 21, about 24hours {{prior to}} its closest approach, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} warning for uninhabited territory of Johnston Island, due to the uncertainty of whether anyone was on the island. A United States Air Force vessel and a 12person crew were on the island, and after securing their ship the crew took shelter in a hurricane-proof concrete bunker. There were no meteorological observations on the island, but the crew estimated tropical storm force winds lasted for about 27hours with hurricane-force winds lasting six to eight hours; peak wind gusts were estimated at [...] The crew sustained no injuries, and their ship received only minor damage. Hurricane Ioke, with a portion of its eye crossing the atoll, left an estimated 15% of <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> on the island with their tops blown off, with some ironwood trees blown over; the island bird population was unaffected. The hurricane produced rough surf which washed away {{a portion of a}} sea wall and an adjacent road.|$|E
500|$|Swiftsures {{bombardment}} of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed {{well away from}} their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the [...] gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her [...] guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with proximity fuses intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective. A subsequent investigation found that a faulty split pin {{had fallen out of}} Swiftsures Admiralty Fire Control Table, most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns. After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia.

Hold on a little, people. If you just checked with Google maps...." [...] Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E
