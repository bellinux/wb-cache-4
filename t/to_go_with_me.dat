500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Within a few weeks, Hall {{was making}} {{preparations}} for a sledging trip {{with the aim}} of beating Sir William Parry's furthest north record. Mistrust amongst the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that [...] "I cannot trust that man (Captain Budington). I want you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship." [...] There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for preservation of specimens. Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior, and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition. With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sledges with first mate Chester, and the native guides Ebierbing and Hendrik, leaving on Oct 10, 1871. The day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the chronometers at the right time every day. In his book Trial by Ice, Richard Parry postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Jena. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence. This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20years of experience.|$|E
2500|$|Before dawn on {{the second}} day, Forsyth said, [...] "Some one must go to Wallace for assistance." [...] Sharp Grover, who was chief of scouts, said [...] "It is {{impossible}} to get out." [...] Then Stilwell came forward and said, [...] "Let me choose the man <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and I will go." [...] Grover said, [...] "Jack is too young and inexperienced, he can’t get through." [...] Ft. Wallace was about [...] to the south east. But Forsyth tore off the fly leaf out of his daybook, wrote a note to Col. Bankhead at Ft. Wallace, {{and gave it to}} Stilwell.|$|E

6000|$|It {{gave her}} another pause; which, however, she happily enough shook off. [...] "Will you consent <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>with</b> <b>me</b> a little--provisionally--as if you did?" ...|$|R
