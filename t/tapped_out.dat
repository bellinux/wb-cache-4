5|$|At WrestleMania XXIV, Edge {{lost the}} World Heavyweight {{championship}} to the Undertaker when he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> to the Hell's Gate. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash {{to retain the}} World Heavyweight championship.

The first match ended with a countout victory for The Undertaker but no champion was crowned due to the circumstances. The second match at One Night Stand saw Edge walk away champion, which also meant Undertaker {{was forced to leave}} the company.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, London and Kendrick made an {{appearance}} in Dragon Gate USA, where Kendrick had already appeared in singles competition. However, their {{run as a}} tag team in the company was short-lived due to losing a Pinfall Loser Leaves Company match to Jimmy Jacobs and Jack Evans {{and as a result}} Kendrick, who <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> to Jacobs, was forced to leave the company for good. They reunited once again on October 4, 2012, at the first Family Wrestling Entertainment's PPV, Back 2 Brooklyn. They, along with Jay Lethal, defeated the team of The Young Bucks and Petey Williams.

50|$|In the {{original}} full tap-in/tap-out design, a multi-zone bus trip could be completed {{for a single}} zone fare by <b>tapping</b> <b>out</b> within the first zone of travel but remaining on the bus. This fault was not publicly acknowledged by the administration until system testing in September 2013. Regardless of the loophole, Transit police or designated transit security fare enforcement officers may issue a fine if they catch riders without adequate fare in a Fare Paid Zone. Furthermore, the <b>tapping</b> <b>out</b> process on buses {{was reported to be}} slow, and failure to record a passenger's <b>tapping</b> <b>out</b> may have resulted in the passenger being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they only travelled through one or two zones.|$|R

25|$|Angle, {{who became}} a fan {{favorite}} {{as a result of}} Austin's treachery, immediately began challenging Austin for the WWF Championship.

25|$|Farmers {{cleared the}} land of trees and drained the swamps, but farming was {{difficult}} due to the glacial till beneath the shallow soil. Other settlers turned to the natural resources left by the glaciers and mined sand and gravel deposits. Limestone and clay mines were opened in the area; shale was discovered and was mined, as well as bituminous coal. Coal mining was a profitable enterprise and seven coal beds were deep mined and later strip mined. Later still, wells were drilled to extract {{oil and natural gas}} from deep within the Earth. When the mines were cleared and the wells <b>tapped</b> <b>out,</b> the land was left barren. Since the mines were left uncapped, the topsoil eroded from the land.|$|E
25|$|At InVasion, the Inaugural Brawl {{took place}} between Team WCW/ECW and Team WWF.

Near {{the end of the}} match, all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle. Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T, who <b>tapped</b> <b>out,</b> but no referee was there to witness it. Austin then dragged a referee into the ring, but in a swerve, kicked Kurt Angle in the stomach, hit him with a Stunner, and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count. Team WCW/ECW won the match due to Austin's betrayal of the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Hiding {{themselves}} {{as best they}} could, with aerials strung up in attics or disguised as washing lines, they <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> Morse on the key of transmitters, and would often wait hours for a reply while alone waiting for a signal in reply saying the messages were received. If they stayed on the air transmitting for more than 20 minutes, their signals {{were likely to be}} picked up by the enemy, and detection vans would trace the source of these suspect signals. When the operator moved location, the bulky transmitter had to be carried, sometimes concealed in a suitcase or in a bundle of firewood. If stopped and searched, the operator would have no cover story to explain the transmitter. In 1943, an operator's life expectancy was six weeks.|$|E
50|$|When a rider starts {{their trip}} by tapping in at Skytrain or Seabus, {{the system will}} {{automatically}} reserve enough fare for three zones. <b>Tapping</b> <b>out</b> {{at the end of}} a trip will ensure that riders are only charged the fare for the distance (in zones) travelled. Failing to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> at the end of the trip may result in a rider being charged a full three-zone fare even if only travelling one or two zones. If the trip is started from a bus, the system will only deduct fare for one-zone.|$|R

25|$|After the Bound for Glory Series, Magnus began a {{feud with}} Bad Influence, who {{assaulted}} {{him during the}} finals, and first challenged them to a six-man tag team match against himself, Sting and Samoa Joe, prior to the match Bad Influence incapacitated Magnus and injured his knee, but Sting and Joe emerged victorious. In the aftermath, Magnus announced {{he was going to}} take on all three members of Bad Influence himself in a gauntlet match. During the gauntlet, Magnus defeated Kazarian and Christopher Daniels, but was defeated by Bobby Roode, who took advantage of his injured knee and made him submit. After the match Magnus began venting his frustrations around the ring before Sting came out to calm him down, which culminated in Sting offering Magnus a match against him at Bound for Glory, which Magnus accepted. Magnus defeated Sting at Bound for Glory after Sting <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> to the King's Lynn Cloverleaf.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista {{successfully}} {{defended the}} World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a Tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista exchanged the World Tag Team Championships with Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX, Evolution defeated the Rock 'n' Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. Later that night, Triple H lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Benoit (in a triple threat match that also involved Shawn Michaels) when he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> to the Crippler Crossface. At Backlash, Flair lost to Shelton Benjamin in one-on-one action. Later that night, Orton defended the Intercontinental Championship successfully against Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) in a Hardcore match, while Chris Benoit retained the World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and Shawn Michaels, this time forcing Michaels to submit with the Sharpshooter.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} held under a one-night tournament format. In the first round, Shamrock was pitted against taekwondo stylist Patrick Smith, who he made short work of by {{throwing}} Smith {{to the mat}} and submitting him with a heel hook. His next opponent would be Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent and eventual tournament winner Royce Gracie. Shamrock sprawled a takedown attempt and maneuvered on top of Gracie, and then grabbed his ankle and sat back to attempt another heel hook. According to Shamrock, however, his arm had gotten tangled in Gracie's gi, and when Shamrock sat back, it pulled Gracie on top of him, which allowed Gracie to secure a choke and submit Shamrock. While the move is often listed as a rear naked choke, Shamrock later stated it to be actually a gi choke, in which Royce would have wrapped the cloth of his gi around Ken's neck. The ending of the fight was also source of controversy because the referee {{did not see the}} tap and ordered the two fighters to continue fighting after Gracie had let go of the hold. Shamrock paused for a few seconds but declined, admitting to the ref that he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> and {{that it would not be}} fair for him to continue fighting.|$|E
