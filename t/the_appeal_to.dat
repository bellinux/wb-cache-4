5|$|In Barker v. Harvey (1901), the Supreme Court {{heard the}} {{consolidated}} appeals {{of a group}} of Mission Indians who had lost a quiet title action by several non-Indians. <b>The</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court was brought by the federal government in its trustee capacity. Justice Brewer, for a unanimous Court (White recused), affirmed.|$|E
5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|Peter Frankopan {{has argued}} that the First Crusade has been {{fundamentally}} distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also {{as a result of a}} state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. <b>The</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Pope Urban II was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan goes further, showing that the Crusade's primary military targets in Asia Minor - Nicaea and Antioch - required large numbers of men with experience of siege warfare; precisely the sort recruited by Urban during his preaching in France in 1095-6.|$|E

5|$|When Tipu's embassy {{visited the}} court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788, Pope Clement XIV's {{representative}} conveyed <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the embassy. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789–92), the British and their allies defeated Tipu. Desperate to break the alliance of powers surrounding him on all sides, Tipu sought {{to make peace with}} Portugal, the Marathas, and other powers. According to Severine Silva, he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians, opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa, with a promise that he would stop molesting the Christians, further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost. The Christians found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in his attitude. The Christians now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Serbian Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes that many of those who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon the Serbian population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist rebels, and called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties for the killing of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E

25|$|Wayland had met Emil Mengshoel — {{the editor}} of the radical Minnesota Populist {{newspaper}} Nye Normanden (New Norseman) — though his prior contributions to <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> Reason, making him a logical choice for the editorial desk. Helle Crøger Mengshoel was a formidable activist in her own right, having worked previously as a trade union organizer in Christiana, Norway (today's Oslo). The couple assented to Wayland's request, moved to Kansas, and on November 29, 1903 the first issue of Gaa Paa (Forward) rolled from the Appeal's presses.|$|E
25|$|After {{a six-week}} lecture tour of Illinois {{on behalf of}} the state Socialist Party {{organization}} in that state, Work left the party's employment to take a job as a teacher of law at LaSalle Extension University in Illinois, a post which he continued for the next four academic years. The school had obtained over 3,000 socialist correspondence students, largely through its advertising in <b>The</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> Reason, and actively sought a qualified socialist teacher for their instruction. Work was hired as a correspondence teacher of law.|$|E
25|$|The Masses was to {{some extent}} defined by its {{association}} with New York’s artistic culture. “The birth of The Masses,” Eastman later wrote, “coincided {{with the birth of}} ‘Greenwich Village’ as a self-conscious entity, an American Bohemia or gipsy-minded Latin Quarter, but its relations with that entity were not simple.” The Masses was very much embedded in a specific metropolitan milieu, unlike some other competing socialist periodicals (such as <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> Reason, a populist-inflected 500,000-circulation weekly produced out of Girard, Kansas).|$|E

Although stated as the Third Edition, this actually constituted the Fourth Edition of the work. A slightly corrected hardcover Fifth Edition followed from Kerr the next year.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the socialist}} press was privately owned as the party was {{concerned}} that a single official publication might lead to censorship {{in favor of the}} editors' views, {{in much the same way}} Daniel DeLeon used The People to dominate the Socialist Labor Party. A number of papers carried the party's official notices in its first years, the most important being The Worker (New York), <b>The</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> Reason (Girard, Kansas), The Socialist (Seattle and Toledo, OH), The Worker's Call (Chicago), St. Louis Labor, and The Social Democratic Herald (Milwaukee).|$|E
