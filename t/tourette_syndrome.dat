5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome)</b> are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is found}} among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been {{reported}} {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E

40|$|Studies of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> have {{indicated}} that the etiology may be either primary or secondary. Secondary <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{has been reported in}} association with numerous neurological conditions, but there have been no previous reports of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and its relationship to neonatal anoxia. This report presents the case of a 15 -year-old boy with a history of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and neonatal anoxia and examines {{whether or not there is}} a connection between the two. To test the hypothesis that this is the first documented case of cerebral anoxia at birth followed by Tourette's, a review of the pertinent literature on secondary <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is presented. Evidence of perinatal anoxia, subsequent <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a negative family history, as well as an examination of the statistical chances of anoxia and <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> co-existing and of all previous reports of acquired <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> tend to favor an organic perinatal insult as having caused the later development of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the case of this adolescent...|$|R
40|$|Dysfunction of the dopaminergic pathway {{has been}} {{postulated}} to underlie the symptomatology of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Presynaptic functional integrity of dopaminergic terminals was assessed with 18 F-dopa PET in 10 patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> three {{of whom were}} drug free and seven of whom were on neuroleptic treatment. Dopamine D 2 receptor site density was measured with 11 C-raclopride PET in a further group of five drug free patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Mean caudate and putamen 18 F-dopa influx constants were similar in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and controls, {{and there was no}} difference in striatal 18 F-dopa uptake between the treated and untreated <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> groups. Mean caudate and putamen 11 C-raclopride binding potentials in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> were also similar to control values. The findings suggest that striatal metabolism of exogenous levodopa and the density of striatal D 2 receptors are both normal in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and that <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> does not arise from a primary dysfunction of dopaminergic terminals...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} the presence of both multiple motor and vocal tics. While the pathogenesis at a molecular and cellular level remains unknown, structural and functional neuroimaging studies point to the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits as the neuroanatomical site for <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Moreover, <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> has a strong genetic component, and considerable {{progress has been made in}} understanding the mode of transmission and in identifying potential genomic loci. Summaries of recent findings in these areas will be reviewed, followed by a critical overview of findings both supporting and challenging the proposed autoimmune hypothesis of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We conclude that <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a heterogeneous disorder, and that immune factors may indeed be involved in some patients...|$|R
5|$|Conditions {{that must}} be {{considered}} in a differential diagnosis along with ADHD include other ASDs, the schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, semantic pragmatic disorder, nonverbal learning disorder, social anxiety disorder, <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome,</b> stereotypic movement disorder, bipolar disorder, social-cognitive deficits due to brain damage from alcohol abuse, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome,</b> might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette's. A subset of OCD {{is thought to}} be causally related to Tourette's and may be a {{different}} expression of the same factors that are important for the expression of tics. The genetic relationship of ADHD to <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome,</b> however, has not been fully established.|$|E
40|$|Changes in moods {{are one of}} the comorbid {{psychiatric}} manifestations {{that frequently}} occur in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The assessment of a manic episode in children with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is challenging. Furthermore, the treatment of children with comorbid mania and <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> has not been extensively studied. We present a 10 -year-old boy who suffered from both <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and mania, whose symptoms improved after using lithium and risperidone. The child was diagnosed with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> at 7 years of age when he suffered from tics and experienced his first manic episode. He received monotherapy, including haloperidol, risperidone and aripiprazole, and the response was poor. When the combination of lithium and risperidone was used, the tics and mania subsided. It is important to assess individuals with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> for associated bipolar disorder. The treatment of children with both disorders is a major clinical issue, and our case may serve as an example for successful treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} data {{have suggested that}} abnormalities in the serotonergic neurotransmissions in frontal-subcortical circuits are involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> To test {{the hypothesis that the}} brain’s 5 -HT 2 A receptor binding is increased in patients with <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> PET imaging was performed. Twenty adults with <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 20 healthy control subjects were investigated with PET-[18 F]altanserin using a bolus-infusion protocol. Regions of interest were delineated automatically on co-registered MRI images, and partial volume-corrected binding parameters were extracted from the PET images. Comparison between control subjects and <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients showed increased specific [18 F]altanserin binding, not only in the a-priori selected brain regions hypothesized to be involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but also post-hoc analysis showed a global up-regulation when testing for a overall difference with a randomization test (p< 0. 03). Increased 5 -HT 2 A receptor binding was found not only in regions closely related to subcortical regions in patients with <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but also in most other brain regions. Our data suggest that the serotonergic transmitter system is pathophysiologically involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and that a clinical trial with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists may be justified...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder manifested by involuntary motor tics and vocalisations. Because the basal ganglia have {{been implicated in}} the pathology underlying <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the present two procedures, both involving sequential movements, sought {{to determine the extent}} to which patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> were reliant on, and could utilise different levels of advance information. Patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> were found to be more reliant than controls on external visual cues to execute rather than to initiate a motor programme. When there was a high level of reduction in advance information [...] that is, a visual pathway to be followed was extinguished well in advance of each successive movement [...] executions progressively slowed as the sequence was traversed. Similarly, if no advance information was provided before each move, movement execution was slower than that of controls. The movement initiation times of patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> were, however, similar to those of controls, as were their movement execution times when advance visual information was available. It seems that patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> like parkinsonian patients who are known to have a basal ganglia disorder, require external sensory cues to sequence a motor programme effectively. The present study found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> like patients with Parkinson's disease, may be dysfunctional in internal switching mechanisms. Alternatively, with limited visual guidance, patients with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> regardless of medication or depression state, may require more time to plan and programme each next submovement, and under such conditions may require external visual cues to direct attention effectively to given targets. Although the underlying pathogenesis is still speculative, it is concluded that there is much to support the notion that <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> may stem from abnormalities of the major pathways between the basal ganglia and the frontal lobes...|$|R

5|$|<b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric {{disorder}} with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} late onset Gilles de la <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> are presented.

Reflex tics may occur in Gilles de la <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but have not been described in late onset <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Such tics must be distinguished from psychogenic myoclonus and the culture bound startle syndrome...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this case {{study was to investigate}} the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in treating <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a childhood- onset disorder that is characterized by sudden, involuntary movements or tics. The participant in this study was a 33 -year-old male who had been diagnosed with <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> at the age of 9 years. His major complaints included facial tics, shoulder shrugging, and clearing the throat. Using a combination of acupuncture, herbs, Gua-Sha, and lifestyle changes once a week for 35 treatments, all the symptoms were reduced by 70 %, as reported by the patient. In this case, the results indicated that Chinese medicine was able to minimize the symptoms of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Further investigation is needed to support this argument. <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which was first described in 1885 by a French physician named Gilles de la Tourette, is characterized by facial tics, involuntary body movements from the head to the extremities, or vocal tics, and it usually has its onset in childhood. It is a neuropsychiatric disorder. The treatment for <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is based on pharmacological treatment, behavior treatment, and deep brain stimulation. Unfortunately, none of these could completely control the symptoms; furthermore, antipsychiatric drugs might cause additional side effects, such as Parkinson symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and metabolic disturbances. Finding acupuncture and oriental medicine literature on treatment of <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> was difficult, especially that written in English. Some research papers that have been translated into English indicated that Chinese herbs and acupuncture could reduce the tics significantly. For example, a study by Dr Pao-Hua Lin reported the significant effects of using acupuncture and oriental medicine in treating 1000 <b>Tourette's</b> <b>syndrome</b> cases. This case was treated to further investigate the principles of Dr Lin's study...|$|R
5|$|<b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{spectrum}} disorder—its severity ranges over {{a spectrum}} from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dating Gilles de la Tourette's 1885 publication, likely {{portrayals of}} TS or tic {{disorders}} in fictional literature are Mr. Pancks in Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens and Nikolai Levin in Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. The entertainment {{industry has been}} criticized for depicting those with <b>Tourette</b> <b>syndrome</b> as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and in the British media.|$|E
