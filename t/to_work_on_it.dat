5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Hideo Kojima and {{his studio}} Kojima Productions {{were working on}} a new Metal Gear game focused on one of its main {{characters}} Raiden, a ninja equipped with swords. Unable to continue working on the game, Kojima contacted Minami to ask PlatinumGames <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> According to Kojima, PlatinumGames was the only studio capable of working on an action game with sword-based combat. The team added stealth elements to the game finding its system too boring and straightforward. Directed by Kenji Saito, the game, titled , was released in 2013 and received generally positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success. It also became the company's first licensed title.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
50|$|Thomas and Box wanted further <b>work</b> done <b>on</b> {{the script}} but Janet Green was unavailable. Eric Ambler was hired <b>to</b> do <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{black-and-white}} photographs exist {{of the original}} incomplete mural, taken when Rivera was forced <b>to</b> stop <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Using the photographs, Rivera repainted the composition in Mexico under the variant title Man, Controller of the Universe.|$|R
500|$|... "Get Enough" [...] is {{the debut}} single by American band Ivy, {{released}} in 1994 by Seed Records. It was included as the opening track {{for their first}} studio album, Realistic (1995). It was composed by band members Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, and produced by the latter two and Kurt Ralske. The song was conceived while the band were creating material for their first extended play, Lately (1994), a project that Durand was initially reluctant <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Its</b> production, {{along with the rest}} of Realistic, was inspired by French musicians and exhibits a folk rock and pop sound.|$|R
5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became {{bored with the}} routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh {{did his best to}} fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
25|$|Although after 1786 {{there is}} no further mention of Murdoch's work on Steam Carriages in Watt's or Boulton's correspondence, a volume of {{evidence}} exists that he continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> without his employers' support, and some argue that a full size version was built.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} video, Arbour {{was fired from}} her job where she was a {{choreographer}} for an anti-bullying video for kids. The director of the film she was hired <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> said <b>it</b> [...] "made me never {{want to see her}} again.".|$|R
25|$|Taylor {{has said}} one of her biggest {{developments}} in college was to build her strength up. Despite pulling down 7.3 rebounds per game, she counted rebounding as a weakness of hers and would continue <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> improve.|$|R
50|$|John Macarthur built Elizabeth Farm in 1793. The {{building}} {{changed and}} grew substantially over the years, and the architect John Verge is thought <b>to</b> have <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> {{from around the}} late 1820s to the late 1830s. It now falls within the Rosehill area and is heritage-listed.|$|R
25|$|The {{producers}} {{were unable}} to find a post-production house in Hollywood willing to process the film or skilled editors willing <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> other than under pseudonyms or at night. The film was shown at only a few theaters; most theaters rejected it, including some that had originally agreed to show it. Union projectionists refused to show it at some theaters that had accepted it.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} {{is not completely}} smooth, as Noah is still struggling somewhat with his own homosexuality, not able to express his feelings as freely as Luke. Noah continues <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and it is at his instigation that the pair become housemates. While Noah had wanted to get an apartment alone with Luke, he compromises on Luke's suggestion by moving into Luke's family home, although the couple {{are not permitted to}} share a bed.|$|E
25|$|Philip True {{had been}} a {{correspondent}} for San Antonio Express-News in Mexico City for three years in Mexico City. He twice tried to convince his editor to let him pursue {{a story about the}} Huichol Indians, who lived in a settlement in the Sierra Madre. After reviewing the idea, Fred Bonativa turned it down, and so True decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> during his vacation time. True planned a ten-day trip that would take him through the state of Jalisco to Nayarit state. He started his journey 1 December 1998 in Tuxpan, Jalisco, was last seen 4 December in Chalmotita, Jalisco, and his wife reported him missing on 10 December.|$|E

25|$|In January 1987, Richard Conn stopped {{developing}} ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who {{already had}} a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) <b>to</b> continue <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR33 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line.|$|R
500|$|The {{size of the}} {{principal}} cast was reduced compared to the previous series, with a fixed number of characters appearing in every episode. Richard Curtis has {{been quoted as saying}} that due to the familiar cast, the series was the happiest for him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on,</b> comparing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a [...] "friendly bunch of school chums".|$|R
25|$|The {{show has}} over two million {{listeners}} on Radio 4 and its recording sessions typically fill 1500-seat theatres {{within a week}} of being advertised. At least one recording for the spring 2006 series filled all its seats within three hours of the free tickets being made available, and the London recording of the autumn series in that year sold out in ten minutes. Although there are twelve Clue shows broadcast per year these are the result of just six recording sessions, with two programmes being recorded back-to-back. The show was recently voted the second funniest radio programme ever, after The Goon Show. It has a large following among professional comedians such as Armando Iannucci, who turned down opportunities <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> preferring to remain a listener.|$|E
25|$|Montalvo was {{originally}} instructed {{to write her}} vita in 1636 by her confessor, Cosimo Pazzi. It was typical for catholic confessors to instruct women to write spiritual autobiographies or vita. These scittura segreta (secret writing) {{were meant to be}} analyzed by confessors so that they could better meet the woman’s spiritual needs. Montalvo worked on her vita for 23 years. She began in 1636 (age 34) and continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> until her death in 1659. This was not common for most women. Women were often commanded to write extensive accounts of their entire spiritual life and were given very little time. Once completed these accounts would be confiscated immediately and would sometimes be used to condemn the female authors as heretics.|$|E
25|$|As enemy aliens, {{at least}} until Peierls' {{naturalisation}} papers came through in February 1940, Frisch and Peierls were generally excluded from the most important–and secret–war work being done by Oliphant's team at Birmingham, that on radar. However, Oliphant would ask Peierls a theoretical question about, say, the solution to Maxwell's equations in a hemispheric cavity. Peierls knew that questions of this nature related to the work on microwave radar, and Oliphant was doubtless aware of this too, but the façade of secrecy was maintained. The nuclear investigation was not yet secret, so Frisch was available <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> He began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources.|$|E

25|$|Cotten and Welles (uncredited) {{wrote the}} Nazi-related thriller Journey into Fear (1943) {{based on the}} novel by Eric Ambler. Released by RKO, the Mercury {{production}} was directed by Norman Foster. It was a collaborative effort due to the difficulties shooting the film and the pressures related to Welles's imminent departure to South America <b>to</b> begin <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>It's</b> All True.|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} {{started in}} 1936 was {{planned to be}} finished sometime in 1944. The NKVD oversaw the project, drafting hundreds of military, civilian and prison workers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The underdeveloped technology of the time required special makeshift caissons (vertical mines for ventilation and soil extraction) {{to be built in}} the middle of the river. Due to technical failures and the start of the war, the construction was never finished or even disclosed to the public. The builders were able only to connect the Right Bank with the close Zhukiv Island (where the present-day southern port is situated). The flooded entrance to the tunnel and abandoned caissons can now be seen in the forests and bays of Holosiivskyi Raion. Contemporary amateur researchers believe that a large secret base component of the project, including a train station, barracks and mass graves of workers, are also located in the depths of the tunnels.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Office 2007 also {{includes}} Groove, which brings collaborative features to a peer-to-peer paradigm. Groove can host documents, including presentations, workbooks and others, created in Microsoft Office 2007 application in a shared workspace, which {{can then be}} used in collaborative editing of documents. Groove {{can also be used}} in managing workspace sessions, including access control of the workspace. To collaborate on one or more documents, a Workspace must be created, and then those who are <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> must be invited. Any file shared on the workspace are automatically shared among all participants. The application also provides real-time messaging, including one-to-one as well as group messaging, and presence features, as well as monitoring workspace activities with alerts, which are raised when pre-defined set of activities are detected. Groove also provides features for conflict resolution for conflicting edits. Schedules for a collaboration can also be decided by using a built-in shared calendar, which {{can also be used to}} keep track of the progress of a project. However, the calendar is not compatible with Microsoft Outlook.|$|E
