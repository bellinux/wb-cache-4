25|$|In January 2010, Kampusch {{said she}} had {{retained}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> {{it was such a}} big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence. The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.|$|E
25|$|The house {{passed to}} his nephews John and then Philip Hammond who {{eventually}} sold {{the house to}} Ninian Pinkney in 1810. Pinkney, however quickly sold the house to Judge Jeremiah Townley Chase in 1811. Judge Chase bought the house as {{a home for the}} family of his daughter Frances Townley Chase Loockerman. He was well acquainted with <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> he rented the northeast wing beginning in the late 1770s.|$|E
25|$|Uskites was a {{temporary}} house opened in 1872 by Mr Stewart, the writing and chemistry instructor {{from the old}} Charterhouse. It was closed in 1878 and the pupils redistributed. The building itself (on Peperharow Road) was bought by a schoolmaster, and later used by the School as a sanatorium. It is now masters' accommodation. Mr Stewart named <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> he likened {{the valley of the}} River Wey (where the house lies) with the valley of the River Usk.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} houses, named after four English martyrs from the 16th century {{during the reign}} of Elizabeth I - Griffith, Gunstone, Saint John Jones and Saint John Rigby. Some {{confusion}} {{can be found in the}} details of <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> <b>because</b> St. John Jones went by the name of 'Griffith' during the 16th century.|$|R
25|$|All new Houses {{apart from}} Bodeites are {{named after the}}ir founders (although Robinites was {{originally}} Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He ran off with the matron, and so <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode. This did lead to some confusion {{at the time of}} naming <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>because</b> some housemasters moved to houses named after their colleagues.|$|R

25|$|Felman {{continued}} {{arguing that}} Mihailović and his Chetniks should be honored for their rescue of US pilots. In 1970, {{he went on}} the Congressional Record pressing for legislation for a statue on Capitol grounds honoring General Mihailović. In 1976 and in 1977, the bill was introduced into the Senate by Strom Thurmond and Barry Goldwater. However, the legislation died in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>because</b> of the aforementioned U.S. policy towards Yugoslavia. It was reintroduced over the next decades several times, but failed each time.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom Chancellor's budget {{statement}} of November 2016, {{it was announced}} that the Trust was to receive a grant of £7.6million for restoration work; the Chancellor noted a claim that the property had been Jane Austen's inspiration for Pemberley in her novel Pride and Prejudice. It was thought that {{there might have been a}} connection to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> Austen uses the name Fitzwilliam in her novel, but following the Chancellor's Autumn Statement the Jane Austen Society dismissed the likelihood that Austen had had the house in mind, given the absence of any evidence that she had visited the estate.|$|E
25|$|The Lutz {{family moved}} in December 19, 1975. Much of the DeFeo family's {{furniture}} {{was still in}} <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>because</b> it was included for $400 {{as part of the}} deal. A friend of George Lutz learned {{about the history of the}} house, and insisted on having it blessed. At the time, George was a non-practicing Methodist and had no experience of what this would entail. Kathy was a non-practicing Catholic and explained the process. George knew a Catholic priest named Father Ray who agreed to carry out the house blessing (in Anson's book, real-life priest Father Ralph J. Pecoraro is referred to as Father Mancuso for privacy reasons).|$|E
25|$|In addition, some modern astrologers {{who follow}} the X=Y=Z or Planet=Sign=House doctrine, which was first taught by Alan Leo {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, believe that certain houses are also ruled by—or have an {{affinity}} with—the planet which rules the corresponding zodiacal sign. For instance, Mars is ruler of <b>the</b> 1st <b>house</b> <b>because</b> it rules Aries, the first sign; Mercury rules (or has an affinity with) <b>the</b> 3rd <b>house</b> <b>because</b> it rules Gemini, the 3rd sign; etc.|$|R

25|$|The {{series was}} bought by CBS in early 2000 for an {{estimated}} $20 million. The United States version of the series officially premiered on July 5, 2000 when the original ten housemates entered the house. Since its inception, the show has been hosted by television personality Julie Chen. It is produced by Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan for Fly on the Wall Entertainment and Endemol Shine North America (formerly Endemol USA). The success of the series has spawned several spin-offs. The series airs once a year, during the summer, {{with the exception of}} the ninth season which aired in spring of 2008 and the Over the Top spinoff series broadcasting in fall 2016. Currently, 19 seasons of the show have aired, along with one digital season. The show has aired a total of 545 episodes since it premiered, with the September 5, 2013 airing marking the 500th episode. To date, there have been a total of 253 HouseGuests compete in the series. Upon entering the house, the HouseGuests who leave the house without permission are not allowed to return. Should a HouseGuest break the rules set in the house, they can be expelled from the house. To date, there have been a total of four HouseGuests expelled from <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> of acts of violence and/or rule-breaking. There have only been three HouseGuests who have voluntarily left the game for reasons relating to personal matters.|$|E

He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> [...] "her boyfriend really hates me".|$|E

[...] When McEwen was late in 1990 to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>because</b> of a massive traffic jam on the I-495 beltway around Washington, D.C., he said on the House floor on February 21 that the District of Columbia's government should be replaced: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of Sheriff Walker and mill {{supervisor}} W. H. Pillsbury to disperse the mobs, white men [...] continued to gather. On the evening of January 4, a mob of armed white men went to Rosewood and surrounded the house of Sarah Carrier. It was filled with approximately 15 to 25 people seeking refuge, including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses. Some {{of the children were}} in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> they were visiting their grandmother for Christmas. They were protected by Sylvester Carrier and possibly two other men, but Carrier may have been the only one armed. He had a reputation of being proud and independent. In Rosewood, he was a formidable character, a crack shot, expert hunter, and music teacher, who was simply called [...] "Man". [...] Many whites considered him arrogant and disrespectful.|$|E
500|$|Lennon grew {{concerned}} that fans who attended Beatles concerts {{were unable to}} hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon's [...] "Help!" [...] expressed his own feelings in 1965: [...] "I meant it... It was me singing 'help'". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his [...] "Fat Elvis" [...] period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> of the likely effects. Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: [...] "We were all screaming... hot and hysterical." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>because</b> I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|In July 1945, the Kilgore {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in Congress, proposing the appointment and removal of a single science administrator by the president, with emphasis on applied research, and a patent clause favoring a government monopoly. In contrast, the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush's proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them. [...] The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights. A compromise Kilgore–Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>because</b> Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of the original Magnuson bill. A Senate bill {{was introduced in}} February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation (NSF) to replace the OSRD. [...] This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush, including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board. [...] The bill passed the Senate and the House, but was pocket vetoed by Truman on August 6, {{on the grounds that}} the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress. The OSRD was abolished without a successor organization on December 31, 1947.|$|E
500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter {{than the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>because</b> of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground {{that at the time of}} the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".|$|E
5000|$|The Act {{allowed for}} workers to rent weekly, lease for 50 {{years with a}} right of renewal, or lease {{with the right to}} buy over a period ranging between 25 and 41 years. In practice, the Government did not {{initially}} advertise the weekly rental, but emphasised the lease with the right to buy. The Act specified that workers could be male or female, but women were discouraged from applying for <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Government was concerned that [...] "houses of ill-repute" [...] might be established.|$|R
