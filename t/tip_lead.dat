40|$|Nanoindentation is {{extensively}} used {{to quantify}} nano-scale mechanical behaviour. A widely-used {{assumption is that}} a well-defined, materialindependent relationship exists between the indentation depth and indenter contact area. Here we demonstrate that this assumption is violated by ionimplanted tungsten, where pileup around the indenter <b>tip</b> <b>leads</b> to substantial changes in contact area. Using high accuracy surface acoustic wave measurements of elastic modulus, {{we are able to}} correct for this effect. Importantly we demonstrate that a priori knowledge of elastic properties can be readily used to compensate for pileup effects in nanoindentation without the need for any further measurements...|$|R

50|$|In ductile {{materials}} (and even {{in materials}} {{that appear to}} be brittle), a plastic zone develops {{at the tip of the}} crack. As the applied load increases, the plastic zone increases in size until the crack grows and the elastically strained material behind the crack tip unloads. The plastic loading and unloading cycle near the crack <b>tip</b> <b>leads</b> to the dissipation of energy as heat. Hence, a dissipative term has to be added to the energy balance relation devised by Griffith for brittle materials. In physical terms, additional energy is needed for crack growth in ductile materials as compared to brittle materials.|$|R

40|$|Copyright Â© 2010 American Institute of PhysicsThe {{design of}} a simple, robust, low-cost, and {{bidirectional}} displacement sensor with subangstrom resolution is described. A small gold plate {{is attached to the}} object, whose displacement is to be measured, and a small gold tip is brought into contact with the plate, establishing a reference current between the two. Movements of the gold plate away from the <b>tip</b> <b>lead</b> to a change in the tip-plate current; the reference current is then re-established by moving the tip using a simple magnetic actuator. The resolution of the sensor has been calibrated using an interferometer and was shown to be as high as 0. 3 AÌ 8 ̆a per system count. Potential applications of the sensor are numerous, including microbar air pressure measurement, motion and infrasound detection, thermal sensing, and gravitational field and relativistic gravity wave measurement...|$|E
40|$|The crack {{propagation}} behavior of amorphous polymers PC and PMMA and of semicrystalline polymers HDPE and PTFE {{has been investigated}} in a gaseous He-atmosphere within a temperature range of 77 K to 220 K. At low temperatures unstable {{crack propagation}} and intrinsic crack stop behavior takes place especially in the Chevron-notched specimens. Adiabatic temperature rise {{at the tip of}} a fast running crack leads to an enhanced plastification. Thus the fracture energy R is increased and the crack stops. At elevated temperatures a transition to stable crack growth takes place. The mean critical energy release rate anti G_I_c and fracture toughness K_I_c have been determined {{as a function of the}} crack opening displacement rate and the temperature. At 77 K and slow deformation rates orientation processes at the crack <b>tip</b> <b>lead</b> to an increase of the material parameters considered. At elevated temperatures the material parameters are influenced by glass transitions. Experiments performed in a LN_ 2 -environment (instead of cold He-gas) show strongly increased material parameters due to a craze formation at the crack tip. REM-pictures of fracture surfaces gives information on the deformation behavior before and the fracture behavior during a fracture process. (orig.) 41 refs.

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} {{is regulated}} by {{a plethora of}} enzymes that influence the stability and dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments. How microtubules are controlled is of particular importance for mitosis, during which dynamic microtubules are responsible for proper segregation of chromosomes. Molecular motors of the kinesin- 8 protein family {{have been shown to}} depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent manner, and recent experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a possible role for kinesin- 8 in the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed molecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing microtubule tip remain elusive. Here we show that two distinct scenarios for the interactions of kinesin- 8 with the microtubule <b>tip</b> <b>lead</b> to qualitatively different microtubule dynamics including accurate length control as well as intermittent dynamics. We give a comprehensive analysis of the regimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary length depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the various proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective of whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length regulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates, and, in particular, limited to small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario...|$|E

40|$|According to {{manufacturers}} of both {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) machines, and implantable neurological pulse generators (IPGs), MRI is contraindicated for patients with IPGs. A major argument for this restriction is the risk to induce heat in the leads due to the electromagnetic field, which could be dangerous for the surrounding brain parenchyma. The temperature change {{on the surface of}} the case of an ITREL-III (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and the <b>lead</b> <b>tip</b> during MRI was determined. An anatomical realistic and a cubic phantom, filled with phantom material mimicking human tissue, and a typical lead configuration were used to imitate a patient who carries an IPG for deep brain stimulation. The measurements were performed in a 1. 5 T and a 3. 0 T MRI. 2. 1 °C temperature increases at the <b>lead</b> <b>tip</b> uncovered the <b>lead</b> <b>tip</b> as the most critical part concerning heating problems in IPGs. Temperature increases in other locations were low compared to the one at the <b>lead</b> <b>tip.</b> The measured temperature increase of 2. 1 °C can not be considered as harmful to the patient.
