Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth {{and power of the}} potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E
5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> did not evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned safely to the boat. The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed some trees across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E

50|$|Until contact, the Andamanese were strict hunter-gatherers. They did not {{practice}} cultivation, and lived off hunting indigenous pigs, fishing, and gathering.

25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so much}} about background and pedigree but about <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E
25|$|They {{carried on}} a {{significant}} correspondence, exchanging over 1,200 letters between 1877 and 1890. The details they shared were extraordinary for <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> never met. He was more open to her about {{much of his life}} and his creative processes than to any other person. Her feedback became so important to him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing. Von Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, he assured her that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter with all the rest for posterity to find.|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{was born}} in Queens, New York. His family moved to Little Italy, Manhattan, before he started school. His father, Charles Scorsese, and mother, Catherine Scorsese (born Cappa), both worked in New York's Garment District. His father was a clothes presser and an actor, {{and his mother was}} a {{seamstress}} and an actress. His father's parents emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, in the province of Palermo, Sicily, and his maternal grandparents were also from Palermo, precisely from Ciminna. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment. As a boy, he had asthma and could not play sports or do any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented Powell and Pressburger's The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> regularly rented that reel. The other was future Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero.|$|E
