The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it is presumably Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He {{was the most important}} script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. Edwin Thanhouser would later recall that this production featured a minor part of a woodsman who ended up ruining the scene through excessive smoking.

[...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing.

60|$|All {{this was}} exciting, but Fleda's spirit dropped, at bedtime, {{in the chamber}} embellished for her pleasure, where she found several of the objects that in her earlier room she had most admired. These had been {{reinforced}} by other pieces from other rooms, so that the quiet air {{of it was a}} harmony without a break, the finished picture of a maiden's bower. It was the sweetest Louis Seize, all assorted and combined--old chastened, figured, faded France. Fleda was impressed anew with her friend's genius for composition. She could say to herself that no girl in England, that night, went to rest with so picked a guard; but there was no joy for her in her privilege, no sleep even for the tired hours that made the place, in the embers of the fire and the winter dawn, look gray, somehow, and loveless. She couldn't care for such things when they came to her in such ways; there was a wrong about them all that turned them to ugliness. In the watches of the night she saw Poynton dishonored; she had cared for it as a happy whole, she reasoned, and the parts of it now around her seemed to suffer like chopped limbs. Before going to bed she had walked about with Mrs. Gereth and seen at whose expense the whole house had been furnished. At poor Owen's, from top to bottom--there wasn't a chair he hadn't sat upon. The maiden aunt had been exterminated--no trace of her to tell her tale. Fleda tried to think of some of the things at Poynton still unappropriated, but her memory was a blank about them, and in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> the old combinations she saw again nothing but gaps and scars, a vacancy that gathered at moments into something worse. This concrete image was her greatest trouble, for it was Owen Gereth's face, his sad, strange eyes, fixed upon her now as they had never been. They stared at her out of the darkness, and their expression was more than she could bear: it seemed {{to say that he was}} in pain and that it was somehow her fault. He had looked to her to help him, and this was what her help had been. He had done her the honor to ask her to exert herself in his interest, confiding to her a task of difficulty, but of the highest delicacy. Hadn't that been exactly the sort of service she longed to render him? Well, her way of rendering it had been simply to betray him and hand him over to his enemy. Shame, pity, resentment oppressed her in turn; in the last of these feelings the others were quickly submerged. Mrs. Gereth had imprisoned her in that torment of taste; but it was clear to her for an hour at least that she might hate Mrs. Gereth.|$|E
