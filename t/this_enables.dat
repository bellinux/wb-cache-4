5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E
5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse {{on the front of}} the vehicle. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching ambulance in their rear view mirrors. Ambulances may display the name of their owner or operator, and an emergency telephone number for the ambulance service.|$|E

5|$|What distinguishes Aerodramus swiftlets {{from other}} swifts, and indeed almost all other birds, is {{their ability to}} use a simple but {{effective}} form of echolocation. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> them to navigate within the breeding and roosting caves.|$|E
5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; <b>this</b> <b>enables</b> the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> the AirTrain to use automatic train operation without drivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E

50|$|The {{invention}} of wound strings, such as nylon covered in wound metal, {{was a crucial}} step in string instrument technology, because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a catgut string of similar thickness. <b>This</b> <b>enabled</b> stringed instruments to be made with less thick bass strings. On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly (e.g., double bass), <b>this</b> <b>enabled</b> instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings, which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play. On stringed instruments in which the player presses a keyboard, causing a mechanism to strike the strings, such as a piano, <b>this</b> <b>enabled</b> piano builders to use shorter, thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes, enabling the building of smaller upright pianos designed for small rooms and practice rooms.|$|R
50|$|The Symbolic Brain: Symbols <b>enabled</b> <b>this</b> {{decoupling}} of bonds. Symbols are cognitive stand-insâ€”a {{wedding ring}} stands {{in for a}} marriage bond. The prefrontal cortex generates symbols. <b>This</b> <b>enabled</b> hunter-gatherer genes to develop new forms of social life including that of modern people.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity â€“ i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. <b>This</b> <b>enables</b> the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
