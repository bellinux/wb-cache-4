5|$|Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time Original Soundtrack is {{the soundtrack}} album of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time, {{containing}} {{the majority of}} the musical tracks from the game, and was composed by Kumi Tanioka. It was released by Square Enix on February 18, 2009. Like previous Crystal Chronicles soundtracks, Echoes incorporates a variety of instruments, including oboes, xylophones, marimbas and Latin guitars. Unlike the previous Crystal Chronicles soundtracks, <b>the</b> <b>Echoes</b> does not include a theme song. The soundtrack spans 51 tracks over 2 discs, covering a duration of 2:07:30, and has the catalog numbers SQEX-10137~8.|$|E
5|$|His most {{successful}} intruder operation {{took place on}} the night of the 17/18 August 1943, when he participated in 100 Group's support of RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra. Braham had decided that it was best to employ the British night fighters in a freelance role. Instead of operating over known German airfields, he elected to interpose the Beaufighters between the outward bomber stream and German airfields in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. He hoped that <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> made by the Beaufighters on the German Lichtenstein radar would attract enemy aircraft and divert them from the bombers.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

As he took more risks in his experimentation, he began looking to Cubist Georges Braque for a new way of arranging still lifes.

25|$|A {{significant}} factor in {{the sound of a}} loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes <b>the</b> <b>echoes,</b> primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.|$|E

25|$|The redeveloped {{building}} {{was designed by}} local W Architects with the glass-clad rotunda designed inspired by Chinese American I.M. Pei.

25|$|A sonar {{target is}} small {{relative}} to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, {{the power of the}} reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000W/m2 signal at 1m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2signal. At 100m the signal will be 1W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10m2 target, it will be at 0.001W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001W/m2 until 300m. Any 10m2 target between 100 and 300m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up <b>the</b> <b>echoes.</b> Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to echolocating prey, bat ears {{are sensitive to}} the fluttering of moth wings, the sounds produced by tymbalate insects, and the movement of ground-dwelling prey, such as centipedes and earwigs. The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as the aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others. [...] Bats can estimate the elevation of their target using the interference patterns from <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For {{full-duplex}} high-speed {{data transmission}} over the two-wire line {{using the same}} frequency band, it is required to sufficiently suppress <b>the</b> <b>echo.</b> <b>The</b> use of a conventional adap-tation method may {{take a long time}} to train <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> canceler. Fast training can be achieved by initializing the coefficients of <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> canceler with an estimate of the impulse response of <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> path. In this letter, we propose a method for fast initialization of <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> canceler by using a circular convolution technique. The proposed method enables the use of real-valued training signals instead of complex-valued ones, resulting in significant reduction of the initialization time as well as the implementation complexity. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed and verified by computer simulation.
