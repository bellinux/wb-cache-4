5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> vibrates increases until <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> hits the mouthpiece. At this point <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and opens it. Each time <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> swings shut again. When played loudly, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
50|$|Long spears were locally {{made with}} <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> of <b>the</b> Persian gulf coast. <b>The</b> <b>reeds</b> {{were similar to}} that of bamboo.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} main {{components}} of any accordion: <b>the</b> <b>reeds,</b> bellows, buttons or keys, and the switches. <b>The</b> accordion has <b>reeds</b> on both <b>the</b> treble and bass sides,The buttons or keys allow air into <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> {{to make a}} sound.The bellows are considered {{the life of the}} instrument, as they expand and contract they draw air into <b>the</b> <b>reeds,</b> and are usually made out of paper. Lastly, the switches control the timbre or voice of the instrument.|$|R
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> or because of the natural vibration cycle of <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Marsh has a {{very low}} risk of {{pollution}} and as such the main threat from man has been from vandalism; in 2007, a fire started by youths destroyed {{a third of the}} Newlands reedbed. This was the second time <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> bed had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck.|$|E
60|$|A puff of smoke; {{a wisp of}} flame; {{and then}} another and another; and a canoe shot out from <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> on <b>the</b> French shore, and glided into <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> of <b>the</b> island.|$|R
50|$|However, for the {{purposes}} of walking between <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> <b>the</b> City of Helsinki has constructed some duckboards, which permit the visitors on the area to walk between <b>the</b> <b>reeds.</b> While these duckboards permit the visitors to walk between <b>the</b> <b>reeds,</b> <b>the</b> duckboards are just two to four planks wide, which require the visitors to apply appropriate caution in general and while passing other visitors. During times of higher water, the duckboards can be submerged in whole or in part, while in winter, the boards can be warped or destroyed by ice.|$|R
5000|$|The reserve, {{which is}} {{adjacent}} to Marbury Country Park, contains {{a range of}} habitats, with <b>the</b> <b>reedbed,</b> carr woodland and semi-natural broadleaved woodland demonstrating the various stages of hydrosere succession (a gradual change from open water to woodland). The open water contains a rich selection of plants, including water lilies, and provides valuable feeding and breeding habitat for kingfishers, little grebes and great crested grebes. <b>The</b> <b>reedbed</b> is almost exclusively composed of common reed and is a residence for summer birds such as reed and sedge warblers. In recent years <b>the</b> <b>reedbed</b> {{has been used as}} an over-wintering site by bittern, and the trust manages <b>the</b> <b>reedbed</b> for this secretive heron by cutting glades through <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> to allow better feeding opportunities. The diminutive and shy lesser spotted woodpecker has also been seen occasionally in the reserve’s woodlands.|$|R
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine which one would succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and stood near the central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E
5|$|Of the 87 {{people who}} entered the Wasatch Mountains, 48 survived. Only <b>the</b> <b>Reed</b> and Breen {{families}} remained intact. The children of Jacob Donner, George Donner, and Franklin Graves were orphaned. William Eddy was alone {{and most of the}} Murphy family had died. Only three mules reached California; the remaining animals perished. Most of the Donner Party members' possessions were discarded.|$|E
5000|$|Cyrill Demian's (see below) patent of 1829 [...] however {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> in his {{instrument}} [...] "were known {{for more than}} 200 years as Regale, Zungen, Schnarrwerk, in organs." [...] He compares <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> used by him with beating reeds.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{traditional}} <b>reeds</b> {{are made}} from stalks of <b>the</b> Giant <b>Reed</b> Arundo donax, called [...] "canna marina" [...] in Italian. <b>The</b> double <b>reed</b> versions may also be made from plastic. <b>The</b> single <b>reeds</b> {{are made from}} a single section of the cane.|$|R
60|$|Two large bundles {{were soon}} made, <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> being tied {{together}} by a tough climber that wreathed itself everywhere among them, {{and as soon as}} it was quite dark they went down to the water's edge, and found to their satisfaction that <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> possessed ample buoyancy for their purpose. Wading in they started swimming, resting their chests on <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> and striking out with their legs, and in a few minutes were on the southern bank of the river.|$|R
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Sedgemoor is a low-lying area {{of land in}} Somerset, England. It lies {{close to}} sea level south of the Polden Hills, forming {{a large part of}} the Somerset Levels and Moors, a wetland area between the Mendips and the Blackdown Hills. The Neolithic people {{exploited}} <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world's oldest known timber trackway, the Post Track, dating to the 3800s BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} (Felis chaus), also called <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> cat or swamp cat, is a {{medium-sized}} cat {{native to the}} Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and southern China. It {{is a member of}} the genus Felis and was first described by Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber gave the jungle cat its present binomial name and is therefore generally considered as binomial authority. Ten subspecies are recognised at present.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reed</b> is {{attached}} to the mouthpiece by the ligature, and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth. In the past clarinetists used to wrap a string around the mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation of the mouth around the mouthpiece and reed is called the embouchure.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's harriers, Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the river has been dually known by the {{indigenous}} Kaurna people's name of Karra wirra-parri (meaning river of the Red Gum forest), referring to the dense eucalyptus forest that lined its banks prior to clearing by early settlers. This name, alternatively Karra-weera, only referred to the lake section of the river, between Adelaide and North Adelaide. It was known as Karrundo-ingga at Hindmarsh, Witoingga near <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> beds, and Yertala everywhere when in flood, which has survived as Yatala in the naming of various places in Adelaide.|$|E
50|$|Double reeds {{are used}} on the oboe, oboe d'amore, English horn, bass oboe, Heckelphone, bassoon, contrabassoon, sarrusophone, shawm, bagpipes, nadaswaram and shehnai. They are {{typically}} not {{used in conjunction with}} a mouthpiece; rather <b>the</b> two <b>reeds</b> vibrate against each other. However, {{in the case of the}} crumhorn, bagpipes, and Rauschpfeife, a reed cap that contains an airway is placed over <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> and blown without <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> actually coming in contact with <b>the</b> player's mouth. <b>Reed</b> strengths are graded from hard to soft.|$|R
