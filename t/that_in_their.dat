5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 20 August 1462, Enrique's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} Gibraltar after launching a surprise attack. His {{success in the}} brief Eighth Siege of Gibraltar {{was due to the}} garrison being greatly depleted after its men of rank had left for Granada, with their retinues, to pay homage to the newly enthroned sultan Abu l-Hasan Ali. An initial assault by the Count of Arcos was beaten back with many casualties on both sides, but the men of the garrison realised <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> depleted state they could not withstand a second assault. They offered to surrender on condition that the garrison and inhabitants of Gibraltar would be allowed to leave with their wives, children and movable goods, with compensation to be paid for the property that they left behind. Although the proposal was welcomed, it fell through due to rivalry between the Christian commanders. The Moorish inhabitants of Gibraltar retreated to the castle and surrendered after a few days to Medina Sidonia. They were expelled along with the city's Jewish population, to be replaced by Spanish Christians.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan's advance {{was stopped}} {{at a place called}} Guhubao for two weeks in late August due to heavy rainfall, giving time to the Sui {{authorities}} to react: the general Qutu Tong was sent to secure Hedong Commandery on the Yellow River, while another army, of 20,000 elite troops under Song Laosheng advanced north to the town of Huoyi, some 17 miles south of Guhubao, to confront him. Huoyi was placed on the southern exit of a defile through which the road passed, following the course of the Fen River, and provided an excellent position from which to check an army coming from the north. When Li Yuan's army learned of Song Laosheng's presence, some began advocating a retreat to Taiyuan, fearing <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> absence the Turks might break the treaty and attack it. A council was held, at which Li Yuan sided with his sons, who argued forcefully for continuing the campaign. Thus, on 8 September, after the rains stopped, Li Yuan's army set out from its encampment. Instead of following the road through the defile, however, they chose a path through the southeastern hills, allegedly revealed to them by a peasant.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{success on}} the pitch has been met with {{increased}} attendances. Promotion into the Premier League meant <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first season of English top-flight football, Wigan Athletic's average home attendance almost doubled from the season before. Over three times more fans attended matches at the stadium during Wigan's 2007–08 season in the Premier League than had attended in the 2001–02 season when Wigan Athletic were in the Football League Second Division. Wigan Athletic's average home attendance for 2007–08 was the lowest out of all 20 teams in the Premier League, failing to make the top 30 English clubs in terms of attendance. The same season saw the highest ever attendance at the stadium, when 25,133 people witnessed Wigan play Manchester United {{on the final day}} of the season.|$|E
5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E

25|$|Convinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet {{government}} and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities. Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early collaborative novels {{it is impossible to}} distinguish their separate contributions. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing and articulate of the two, it was frequently assumed, at the time, that she was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.|$|E
