50|$|A fixed {{retainer}} typically {{consists of}} a passive wire bonded to the lingual-side of the (usually, depending on the patient's bite, only lower) incisors. Unlike the previously-mentioned retainer types, fixed retainers cannot be removed by the patient.

While the device is usually required until a year after wisdom teeth have been extracted it is often kept in place for life.

40|$|We {{reported}} {{in our previous}} work that the EDEN-dependent translational repression of maternal mRNAs was conserved between Drosophila and Xenopus. In Xenopus, this repression is achieved through the binding of EDEN to the Bruno-like factor, EDEN-BP. We show in the present work that the Drosophila Bruno paralogue, the 45 kDa Bru- 3 protein (p 45), binds specifically to the EDEN element and acts as a homodimer. We describe {{for the first time}} a previously undetected 67 amino acid domain, found in the divergent linker region, the lsm domain (lsm stands for linker-specific motif). We propose that the presence of this domain in a subset of the Bruno-like proteins, including Bru- 3, EDEN-BP and CUG-BP but not Bruno nor its other paralogue Bru- 2, might be responsible for specific RNA recognition. Interestingly, comparative structural analyses using <b>threaders</b> and molecular modelling suggest that the new domain might be distantly related to the first RNA recognition motif of the Drosophila sex-lethal protein (sxl). The phylogenetic analyses and the experimental data based on its specific binding to the EDEN element support the conclusion that Bru- 3 is an EDEN-BP/CUG-BP orthologue...|$|R

In case you suffer through waxing, {{you really need to}} know about the wonderful process of threading. It’s literally done with a sewing thread: the “threader” holds one end of the thread in her mouth, wraps the middle around two or three fingers in her left hand, and manipulates the other end like a pair of scissors in her right hand. This way she can grab a whole row of eyebrow hairs and yank them out before you even notice; it’s only a little bit painful.

40|$|A {{strategy}} is presented for protein fold recognition from secondary structure assignments (alpha-helix and beta-strand). The method can detect similarities between protein folds {{in the absence}} of sequence similarity. Secondary structure mapping first identifies all possible matches (maps) between a query string of secondary structures and the secondary structures of protein domains of known three-dimensional structure. The maps are then passed through a series of structural filters to remove those that do not obey simple rules of protein structure. The surviving maps are ranked by scores from the alignment of predicted and experimental accessibilities. Searches made with secondary structure assignments for a test set of 11 fold-families put the correct sequence-dissimilar fold in the first rank 8 / 11 times. With cross-validated predictions of secondary structure this drops to 4 / 11 which compares favourably with the widely used <b>THREADER</b> program (1 / 11). The structural class is correctly predicted 10 / 11 times by the method in contrast to 5 / 11 for <b>THREADER.</b> The new technique obtains comparable accuracy in the alignment of amino acid residues and secondary structure elements. Searches are also performed with published secondary structure predictions for the von-Willebrand factor type A domain, the proteasome 20 S alpha subunit and the phosphotyrosine interaction domain. These searches demonstrate how the method can find the correct fold for a protein from a carefully constructed secondary structure prediction, multiple sequence alignment and distant restraints. Scans with experimentally determined secondary structures and accessibility, recognise the correct fold with high alignment accuracy (86 % on secondary structures). This suggests that the accuracy of mapping will improve alongside any improvements in the prediction of secondary structure or accessibility. Application to NMR structure determination is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|MOTIVATION: Membrane {{proteins}} are clinically relevant, {{yet their}} crystal structures are rare. Models of membrane proteins are typically built from template structures with low sequence identity {{to the target}} sequence, using a sequence-structure alignment as a blueprint. This alignment is usually made with programs designed for use on soluble proteins. Biological membranes have layers of varying hydrophobicity, and membrane proteins have different amino-acid substitution preferences from their soluble counterparts. Here we include these factors into an alignment method to improve alignments and consequently improve membrane protein models. RESULTS: We developed Membrane Protein <b>Threader</b> (MP-T), a sequence-structure alignment tool for membrane proteins based on multiple sequence alignment. Alignment accuracy is tested against seven other alignment methods over 165 non-redundant alignments of membrane proteins. MP-T produces more accurate alignments than all other methods tested (δF(M) from + 0. 9 to + 5. 5 %).

40|$|Current {{homology}} modeling {{methods for}} predicting protein–protein interactions (PPIs) have difficulty in the “twilight zone” (< 40 %) of sequence identities. Threading methods extend coverage {{further into the}} twilight zone by aligning primary sequences {{for a pair of}} proteins to a best-fit template complex to predict an entire three-dimensional structure. We introduce a threading approach, iWRAP, which focuses only on the protein interface. Our approach combines a novel linear programming formulation for interface alignment with a boosting classifier for interaction prediction. We demonstrate its efficacy on SCOPPI, a classification of PPIs in the Protein Databank, and on the entire yeast genome. iWRAP provides significantly improved prediction of PPIs and their interfaces in stringent cross-validation on SCOPPI. Furthermore, by combining our predictions with a full-complex <b>threader,</b> we achieve a coverage of 13 % for the yeast PPIs, which is close to a 50 % increase over previous methods at a higher sensitivity. As an application, we effectively combine iWRAP with genomic data to identify novel cancer-related genes involved in chromatin remodeling, nucleosome organization, and ribonuclear complex assembly. iWRAP is available at [URL] Institutes of Health (U.

Optimal sequence alignment of PSMA and TfR using the known three-dimensional structures of AMP, CPG 2, and SGAP shows that the critical amino acids involved in forming the catalytic pocket are conserved in PSMA but absent in the TfR. The specificity pocket in AMP is formed from four aromatic side chains and the equivalent region in CPG 2 /PSMA has a changed sequence pattern.
