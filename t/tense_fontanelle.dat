40|$|Analysis of 116 {{cases of}} {{subdural}} haematoma and effusion in infancy {{showed that in}} 40 % trauma was involved and in 5 % meningitis was an aetiological factor; in the remainder there was no known antecedent disease. Apart from retinal or subhyaloid haemorrhages there were no clinical features pathognomonic of the condition, though vomiting was the commonest presenting symptom and a <b>tense</b> <b>fontanelle</b> the commonest finding on examination. Treatment by subdural pleural shunt operation, which allows the fluid to drain into the chest, where it is absorbed, {{was found to be}} effective, and {{there is no longer any}} justification for the older method of removal of the subdural membrane by craniotomy...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{cases of}} late {{haemorrhagic}} disease of infancy due to vitamin K deficiency present-ing with intracranial haemorrhage were seen over a three- year period from 1984 to 1986. The clinical picture was fairly typical; a {{short history of}} being unwell (poor feeding, vomiting, irrit-ability, high pitched cry, fits) and physical findings of pallor, a normal body temperature, im-pairment of consciousness, abnormal respiration and a very <b>tense</b> anterior <b>fontanelle.</b> Vitamin K deficiency was implicated by the prolonged prothrombin time which rapidly re-turned to normal with vitamin K injection. The outcome was poor. Possible factors giving rise to vitamin K deficiency are discussed. The author suggests {{the introduction of the}} giving of vitamin K to all new-borns. Key Words; intracranial haemorrhage, late haemorrhagic disease of infancy, vitamin K deficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} features of 107 cases {{of children with}} hydrocephalus and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively. Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having hydrocephalus, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid. The most common symptoms in the group were vomiting, behavioural changes, drowsiness, and headaches. The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, <b>tense</b> anterior <b>fontanelles,</b> splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and {{a quarter of the}} cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs. There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular rash and sweating. We believe that the presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure...|$|R
40|$|Intraventricular {{hemorrhage}} is {{a serious}} disease that usually occurs in the first hours or days of life, especially in premature infants weighing less than 1500 g. We present the case of full-term newborn with normal birth weight who was non-institutionally delivered. At 17 days old, he was referred to the Paquito González Cueto Hospital because of fever and seizures. Subsequently, he {{was admitted to the}} Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Increased head circumference, <b>tense</b> anterior <b>fontanelle</b> and global hypertonia were found. A transfontanelle ultrasound revealed a subependymal/intraventricular hemorrhage. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms and echoencephalographic results improved as occurs in 65 % of cases. We decided to present this case since the condition developed in a full-term newborn with normal weight, which is unusual, {{and the fact that he}} was born outside a hospital. Although the relationship between this fact and the disease could not be established, it helps general practitioners to develop the ability to consider such serious diseases in cases that do not necessarily meet what is classically described...|$|R
40|$|Late Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB) {{may develop}} in rare {{situations}} between 1 and 6 months of age. A case {{is presented in}} which the infant did not receive Vitamin K at birth and developed an intracranial bleed at 4 weeks of age. Despite presenting with a fixed dilated pupil this infant recovered well. The case illustrates a problem of the persistence of misinformation relating to optimal infant care. THE CASE A four-week old exclusively breast-fed male infant {{was presented to the}} emergency department with a two day history of inconsolable crying and vomiting. The baby was born at term at home by spontaneous vaginal delivery with an unremarkable antenatal and postnatal course. Vitamin K was not given at birth following parental refusal. On examination the baby had a <b>tense,</b> bulging anterior <b>fontanelle,</b> with a right fixed and dilated pupil which was unresponsive to light. Careful collection of the history and examination of th...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{clinical}} features of 107 cases {{of children with}} hydrocephalus and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively. Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having hydrocephalus, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid. The most common symptoms in the group were vomiting, behavioural changes, drowsiness, and headaches. The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, <b>tense</b> anterior <b>fontanelles,</b> splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and {{a quarter of the}} cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs. There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular rash and sweating. We believe that the presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure. The classical adult presentation of raised intracra-nial pressure (headache, vomiting, and papil-loedemal) is rare in children with progressive hydrocephalus. There are few studies of the clinical presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intracra-nial pressure either before or after an operation to divert the cerebrospinal fluid. There are certainly no studies in which raised intracranial pressure has been confirmed by direct measurement, and such reports that do exist in children frequently include those with causes of raised intracranial pressure other than hydrocepha-lus alone. The aim of this study therefore was to document the symptoms and signs of 107 cases of progressive hydrocephalus (that is, hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure) in which the {{clinical features}} were documented and raised ven-tricular pressure had been confirmed on direct measurement. Patients and methods All the patients were admitted to the neurology uni...|$|R
