5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E

Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris at a lower priced contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he would become an unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
5|$|During {{a series}} of combats held to {{celebrate}} King Joffrey Baratheon's name day, the captive Sansa Stark saves the drunkard Ser Dontos Hollard's life by convincing Joffrey <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> fool instead of killing him.

Cersei is furious, but accepts the new situation after her brother assures her that he will only act as an advisor. When Tyrion learns that Cersei has let Arya Stark escape after the execution of her father, he mocks her for throwing away two valuable hostages, as he'd planned to trade the girls for Jaime.|$|E

5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> complete athlete.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had {{purchased}} the minor-league Providence Grays, {{members of the}} International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, {{and as part of}} the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed him off waivers. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> better player, but to help the Grays win the International League pennant (league championship).|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered {{as a result of}} the dispute.|$|E

5|$|Partway {{through the}} series, the show's unseen camera {{operator}} and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where {{his body is}} left partially preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is startled by light and escapes the lab, running into the woods.

5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E

Ruffleberg outfitted {{him with an}} intelligence chip <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired by making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg's help, {{the boy and his}} canine companion break into Carltron's room. The area is guarded by android clones of the boy and his dog, along with a giant mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place.|$|E
