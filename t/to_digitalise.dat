40|$|The former conflict-torn area of Northern Uganda {{has only}} {{recently}} developed into a ‘safe haven’ for refugees from South Sudan. At the same time, Ugandan state officials picture inner-African migration {{as a threat to}} the internal security of the country, and to its Northern region in particular. This thesis is based on an ethnographic study in Northern Uganda and aims to describe how the Ugandan state tries to manage and control the movements of immigrants. Law enforcement practices are illustrated and analysed in case of passport control interactions. Police and immigration officers categorize people into citizens, migrants, refugees or as illegal by making use of documents in addition <b>to</b> <b>digitalised</b> personal data. For this categorization work they further require embodied skills, knowledge and networks that they can rely on. These networks are established between various state institutions. But they also appear informally between officers and immigrants, and often involve payments that are commonly referred to as corruption. This study tries to understand networking practices from an emic point of view, whereby it combines perspectives from multiple actors. On the one hand, it presents state agents and various challenges they face during work, while on the other hand it portraits the experiences of inner-African immigrants in Northern Uganda. All in all, the thesis concludes that while the Ugandan state tries to maintain the security of the country through new policies, their practical implementation often increases the insecurity of immigrants...|$|R

30|$|The {{described}} analog method {{allows us}} to perform the feedforward without an actual knowledge of the result of Alice’s measurement. Indeed, the JPA and HEMT amplifiers work as measurement devices. On the one hand, the advantage is that we save the time required <b>to</b> <b>digitalised</b> the signal. On the other hand, the disadvantage {{is that all the}} noise sources in Alice are mixed, resulting in a doubling of the noise A, as we see in Eqs. (32)-(33) (the same claim holds for the lossy case). Therefore, one should carefully evaluate whether the digital feedback is convenient against the analog one, by comparing A, which quantify the loss of fidelity in the analog feedforward case, with the noise added due to the delay line added in Bob in the digital feedforward case. This can be done by estimating the digitisation time and the corresponding losses in the Bob delay line, which strongly depends on the available technology. Indeed, currently available IQ mixers and FPGA technology requires t_p∼ 200 - 400  ns for measuring and processing the information. During this time, the signal needs to be delayed in Bob’s channel. If we consider a delay line where the group velocity of the electromagnetic field is v≃ 2 × 10 ^ 8  m/s, t_p corresponds to a delay line in Bob of 40 - 80  m. Comparing the values of Δξ^' 2 for the zero measurement time and the realistic 200  ns measurement time, we see a change in Δξ^' 2 of ∼ 0.30 in the case of 1 m distance (assuming 0.1 dB per meter of power cable losses), which is considerably lower than the current values achievable for A. Notice that this discrepancy decreases with the distance between Alice and Bob. This means that the digital feedforward is currently preferable to the analog one, but the analog feedforward can become a useful technological tool when the JPA technology will reach a reasonable noise level.|$|R

The resulting complex line provides detailed data about the surface gradients {{at the intersection of}} the laser light plane and the surface but cannot create correspondence between points of reflections and surface points. The latter is inherent in a traditional active light scanning setup whose data alone will, for specular surfaces, be subject to high levels of noise.

A brief history explains the background and development of lighting technology, through to film and more recently motion capture technology. Through sources of pre-existing literature and my interpretation of video excerpts of contemporary dance, I explore various techniques and effects generated by projections. The examples are categorised by three relationships; firstly the dancer initiating a response from the visual imagery; secondly, the visual imagery stimulating a response from the dancer and; thirdly, where there is a connection between the dancer and the projected imagery that is only visible to the audience. Techniques such as layering of images directly onto the body, using motion capture technology <b>to</b> project <b>digitalised</b> light patterns onto a dancer and the space, as well as using projections as a backdrop are all explored for evidence of an interdependent synergy...|$|R

As a participator on such a stage it is easy to fall between one's frontstage and backstage personality, and thus act differently thereafter. Goffman's theory could be associated with how the bloggers perform on their platform, as well as how their written words frontstage have an affect on their young female readership. See, frontstage they might be telling the truth, but backstage the truth might not be as it first seemed like. Furthermore, an emperical analysis on three bloggers, who {{are some of the most}} popular in Norway, has been conducted about their experiences with mental health and similar issues.

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies are increasingly transforming our urban lives, {{giving rise to}} what is {{commonly referred to as}} the ‘smart city’. Understood as technologically enhanced urban services (i. e. metered, networked, monitored and computed, mostly and preferably in real-time), the ICT industry showcases a full range of perfectly integrated ‘smart city’ technologies in pilot projects around the world. While still focusing on the technological understanding of ‘smart’, this paper, however, explores the less advertised and seemingly more trivial transformations happening in our existing cities. By doing so, three aspects of the process of becoming ‘smart’ are identified, highlighted and exemplified by a case in Stuttgart, Germany. First, the sector and often company connected and incremental approach make it unobtrusive and hardly noticeable as an integrated ‘smart city’ concept. Second, democratic and public debate is absent, as the promised or envisioned results are on the one hand seductive and desired and consequently (rightly) assumed to be a priori supported by majorities {{and on the other hand}} often designed and implemented by the private sector. Third, although individual transformations may not seem radical, their combined implications and potential for urban governance and planning can be profound, especially in combination with the renewed idea of rational, non-ideological decision making through algorithmic data analysis. This paper describes these aspects on the basis of the case polygo in Stuttgart, a recent effort <b>to</b> further <b>digitalise</b> and network public transport and private e-mobility services, effectively and incrementally implementing a ‘smart mobility’ concept throughout the Region of Stuttgart...|$|R

Site maps of 25 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, published in the series 'Atlas of Chinese Cultural Relics', were used <b>to</b> extract, <b>digitalise</b> and correlate its archaeological data. The data were, in turn, entered into a database using a self-developed mapping software that makes the data, in a dynamic way, analysable as a contribution to various scientific questions, such as population growth and migrations, spread of agriculture and changes in subsistence strategies. The results clearly show asynchronous patterns of changes between {{the northern and southern}} parts of China (i. e. north and south of the Yangtze River, respectively) but also within these macro-regions. In the northern part of China (i. e. along the Yellow River and its tributaries and in the Xiliao River basin), the first noticeable increase in the concentration of Neolithic sites occurred between c. 5000 and 4000 BC; however, highest site concentrations were reached between c. 2000 and 500 BC. Our analysis shows a radical north-eastern shift of high site-density clusters (over 50 sites per 100 * 100 km grid cell) from the Wei and middle/lower Yellow Rivers to the Liao River system sometime between 2350 BC and 1750 BC. This shift is hypothetically discussed {{in the context of the}} incorporation of West Asian domesticated animals and plants into the existing northern Chinese agricultural system.

Background: Early Intervention (EI) is a computerized self-assessment for older people. It is available with or without assistance in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, and results in resources to enhance health and independence. Objectives and question: Evaluate EI to enhance and implement it for a larger audience, maintaining health and independence for older people internationally. The research question is: How do users and facilitators of the Early Intervention judge its practical use and its {{psychological and}} behavioural impact on its users and {{on the health care}} system? Methods: An evaluative case study containing ten interviews with EI’s users and a group interview with two facilitators. Users: having used EI and its first evaluation. Facilitators: having a professional attachment to EI, having assisted older people while conducting the assessment. Discourse analysis contained a single- and multiple case analyses by finding themes using a matrix approach. Results: Promotion was limited, computer use and the content acceptable, and assistance appreciated. Main motivation was to assist the researcher. The impact was limited: minimal recollection and use of resources. Conclusions: EI’s practical use was well received. Impact was limited, due to limited intervention promotion, lack of understanding its concept, and motivations to help the researcher instead of themselves, possibly leading to minimal recollection and no usage of resources. Those understanding EI’s concept did benefit by knowing where to find resources if needed. Recommendations: Further studies with hard copies of resources, extended promotion, and a larger and more diverse sample size.
