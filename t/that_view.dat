5|$|In 1925–26, while {{teaching}} at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis for}} full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. <b>That</b> <b>view</b> was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought <b>that</b> <b>view</b> into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{election}} Theobald selected his brother Walter to be archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1148 promoted {{him to be}} Bishop of Rochester. Theobald attended the council held by Stephen in June 1139 that deprived Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, of their castles. According to most historians, Theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council, which eventually ended with Roger's death in 1139 and Nigel and Alexander's restoration to favour. Recently however, <b>that</b> <b>view</b> has been challenged by two historians who argue that Theobald took {{a more active role}} in the council. They base their view on a Vita, or Life of the 12th-century mystic Christina of Markyate, which narrates the events and gives a more central role to Theobald, instead of Henry of Blois, in challenging Stephen's arrest of the three bishops.|$|E
50|$|Theories <b>that</b> <b>views</b> out {{of windows}} cause distractions {{were one of}} the prime motivations for the {{windowless}} classroom of the 1960s and 70s. More recent studies have demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>views</b> of nature potentially improve health and well-being and that more stimulating environments foster improvements in learning and retention. Ophthalmologists have stressed the importance of distant views to help relax the eye engaged in close work, such as on a video or computer monitor. Attention Restoration Theory suggests <b>that</b> <b>views</b> of natural scenes have the potential to restore a person's ability to focus and concentrate after intense cognitive activity.|$|R

5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore showed {{their support for}} Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region’s security and stability. <b>That</b> <b>view</b> was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge’s Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective {{on foreign policy}} had been dominated {{by the need to}} maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist. Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with <b>that</b> <b>view.</b> However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of ASEAN.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle shocked the Croatian {{commander}} and later resulted in speculation about its cause. Stipetić blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for {{the collapse of the}} Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence. He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod and thought the {{outcome of the}} battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders, Radovan Karadžić and Mate Boban. General Karl Gorinšek, commander in charge of defending neighboring Slavonia during Posavina's fall, said that the Croatian administration showed no interest in defending Posavina and that he continuously got orders to not take any initiative in defending the territory. Stipetić's view regarding the Graz agreement is echoed by British historian Marko Attila Hoare, who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina. On the other hand, Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich, among others, described <b>that</b> <b>view</b> as a conspiracy theory. While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA-held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with <b>that</b> <b>view,</b> Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E
