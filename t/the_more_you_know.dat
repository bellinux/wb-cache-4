25|$|Hargitay {{appeared}} in the 17th season of NBC's <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> public service announcements in 2006, {{and again in the}} spring of 2009. She is an honorary board member director of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} understand," [...] she cried wildly, {{beginning}} to lose self-control--"It's {{not that way}} I mean. I do like you; <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I've <b>known</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I've liked <b>you.</b> And {{at the same time}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I've <b>known</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> less would I care to marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{taken my}} fun where I've found it, [...] And now I {{must pay for}} my fun, [...] For <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> 'ave <b>known</b> o' <b>the</b> others, [...] The less will you settle to one----" ...|$|R

25|$|The network's Saturday morning children's {{programming}} {{time slot}} is programmed by Litton Entertainment under a time-lease agreement. The three-hour block of programming designed for 14-16 year-old teenage viewers {{is under the}} umbrella branding of <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> based on the network's long-time strand of internally-produced public service announcements of the same name. It premiered on October 8, 2016, giving Litton control of all but Fox's Saturday morning E/I programming among the five major broadcast networks.|$|E
25|$|On March 28, 2012, NBCUniversal {{announced}} {{an agreement with}} sister cable channel PBS Kids Sprout (now Sprout, which was integrated into NBCUniversal through its 2011 acquisition by the channel's existing part-owner Comcast) to produce and program new weekend morning preschool blocks for NBC and Telemundo. The block, MiTelemundo, premiered on July 7, 2012 and also airs Saturday and Sunday mornings; as with its predecessors, it consists of Spanish dubbed versions of programs seen on its sister broadcast network's Saturday morning block, NBC Kids, which debuted on the same date. With NBC Kids being replaced with Litton Entertainment's <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> E/I block on NBC by September 25, 2016, MiTelemundo retained on television with the same programming from the former NBC Kids block.|$|E
25|$|As an NBC owned-and-operated station, KXAS {{differs from}} many network-owned {{stations}} {{in that it}} does not carry its associated network's complete programming schedule. The station currently does not clear NBC's weekday overnight lineup, opting instead to air syndicated programming after Last Call with Carson Daly; it has never cleared the network's broadcast of CNBC's Mad Money during NBC's carriage of the program from September 2012 until the network replaced it with an extended rolling block of Early Today in September 2017, although it did air the rebroadcast of the fourth hour of Today from its addition to the overnight block in September 2011 until September 2015. In addition, KXAS also airs <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> educational block on a one-hour delay due to the 9:00a.m. hour of its Saturday morning newscast (which itself airs as a split two-hour format bookending the Saturday edition of Today), resulting in the third hour of the block being shifted to Sundays whenever network sports telecasts are scheduled on Saturdays during the noon hour or earlier in order to meet FCC educational programming quotas.|$|E

But I {{can tell}} you what, Mr. Kenton: I believe that you could tell him every word of it, and only make him {{appreciate}} her <b>the</b> <b>more.</b> Till <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that about Ellen, <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> what a character she is. I just ached to tell him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I've {{taken my}} fun where I've found it, [...] An' now I {{must pay for}} my fun, [...] For <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> 'ave <b>known</b> o' <b>the</b> others [...] The less will you settle to one; [...] An' the end of it's sittin' and thinkin', [...] An' dreamin' Hell-fires to see; [...] So be warned by my lot (which I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will not), [...] An' learn about women from me! ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stage and}} field {{rendering}} transitioned into a [...] "breezy" [...] beach setting, with dancers dressed as sharks, {{palm trees and}} smiling beach balls dancing around Perry. She underwent a wardrobe change, and progressed into a [...] "campy" [...] medley of [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and [...] "California Gurls". Rapper Missy Elliott subsequently appeared, performing her songs [...] "Get Ur Freak On" [...] and [...] "Work It", while Perry played [...] "hype-woman" [...] beside her, having now changed once again into a custom Super Bowl 49 jersey. After Perry briefly disappeared, Elliott performed [...] "Lose Control". Perry returned, now sporting a [...] "star-encrusted gown" [...] for her closing song, [...] "Firework". She rose out of midfield on a narrow platform that was attached to a shooting star prop, and flew above the crowds. During this performance, fireworks exploded around Perry and the stadium. The star Perry flew around the stadium attached to was heavily compared to <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Knows</b> public service announcements logo.|$|R
500|$|... "B" [...] argues with [...] "A". He says ethics are the highest. [...] "A" [...] {{wants to}} remain a mystery to himself but [...] "B" [...] says it's {{the meaning of life}} to become open to yourself. It's more {{important}} to know yourself than historical persons. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about yourself the more you can find your eternal validity. God will bless the most ethical person. Each one knows what's best for the other but neither knows what's best for himself.|$|E
500|$|... "The Son Also Draws" [...] {{was written}} by Ricky Blitt and {{directed}} by Neil Affleck, both working on their first Family Guy episode. The episode guest starred actors Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman and actor Patrick Bristow. Much of the episode's humor is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including references to Speed Racer, Happy Days, Nova, One Day at a Time, and <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know.</b>|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} kill you--now," [...] said the ape-man. [...] "First I shall go and learn {{if you have}} lied to me {{and if you have}} your death shall be <b>the</b> <b>more</b> terrible. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how Major Schneider died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't suppose I {{had asked}} her?" [...] The point was {{positively}} that she didn't; yet {{it made us}} {{look at each other}} almost as hard as if she did. [...] "No, of course you couldn't have supposed anything so cruel--all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> that, as <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> I had not admitted the possibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is heartily {{deserving of}} it," [...] said Neville; [...] "and I am glad you excuse me, which <b>you</b> may do <b>the</b> <b>more</b> frankly, when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that I am so unfortunate {{as to have}} no better right to the name of Neville, by which I have been {{generally}} distinguished, than to that of Lovel, under which <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> me." ...|$|R
500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The more you learn, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that you don't know anything at all." [...] Writing in his study of Harrison's musical career, Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song [...] "It's All Too Much", where Harrison sings: [...] "The more I learn, the less I know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Decompression is an {{area where}} you {{discover}} that, the more you learn, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that you really don't know what is going on. For behind the [...] "black-and-white" [...] exactness of table entries, the second-by-second countdowns of dive computers, and beneath the mathematical purity of decompression models, lurks a dark and mysterious physiological jungle that has barely been explored.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.5, {{saying it was}} [...] "Great" [...] and [...] "Overall, [...] "Like any sitcom, the jokes get funnier <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about, and like, the characters. Our {{experiences}} with Luke made him running after his grandfather's RV like an excited puppy, with Phil yelling, [...] "No, Luke, stay! Luke! Stay!" [...] all the more funny. So the more we see of Frank, the better." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was pretty}} {{taken aback by}} this ... this big fella with so much energy and so much passion {{standing}} up there, proud of his ... his world of Shepp, and rapping in a way that, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> is so comparable {{to some of the}} greats, some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> powerful MCs, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> that I’ve followed over the years. And he was only 19 years of age.|$|R
5000|$|From an {{interview}} in the Live Earth program Toni Collette says [...] "I never wanted this record {{to be a big}} loud statement. I just wanted it to be quiet, organic and very old school, cruisey in a lo-fi kind of way. It's like in life there are the people who talk a lot and needs a lot of attention and then there is someone who is really quiet - I want my record to be like that quiet person. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> get to <b>know</b> it, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> like it" ...|$|R
5000|$|Aslam Sher Khan In 1966, {{was called}} {{up for the}} All India schools hockey camp at Bhopal. But his father fell ill at that time. He {{did not want to}} join the camp but his father {{motivated}} him by saying [...] "The <b>more</b> <b>you</b> play, and <b>the</b> better <b>you</b> play, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> I'll <b>know</b> <b>you</b> love me." [...] That reverberated like an order to him and he went to join the camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{confess to}} that; I don't {{want to know}} {{anything}} more--I know too much already. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the more unhappy you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's good, too," [...] said Corey, [...] "and {{perfectly}} {{innocent and}} transparent. I {{think you will}} like her the better <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, you'll {{be ashamed}} of me every day of your life,' he answered; 'and the more ashamed, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> me; and I cannot bide it.' ...|$|E
60|$|But now, {{all of a}} sudden, Johnny Chuck became {{dissatisfied}} with his home. It was too near the Lone Little Path. Too many people knew where it was. It wasn't big enough. The front door ought to face the other way. Dear me, what a surprising lot of faults a discontented heart can find with things that have always been just right! It was so with Johnny Chuck. That house {{in which he had}} spent so many happy days, which had protected him from all harm, of which he had been so proud when he first built it, was now the meanest house in the world. If other people had new houses, why shouldn't he? <b>The</b> <b>more</b> he thought about it, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> dissatisfied and discontented he became and of course <b>the</b> <b>more</b> unhappy. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> one cannot be dissatisfied and discontented and happy at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|On October 9, 2014, Billboard {{announced}} that Katy Perry would perform at halftime and the NFL confirmed the announcement on November 23, 2014. At {{the start of}} the halftime show, on-field participants held up light globes which created a bird's-eye view of the Pepsi logo. Perry entered the stadium riding atop a large, golden mechanical lion, opening her set with a performance of [...] "Roar". She then proceeded to sing [...] "Dark Horse", with 3D rendering on the field creating a chessboard visual where the turf constantly turned into [...] "different shapes and sizes", as acrobats surrounded the singer. Following this, Perry joined Lenny Kravitz for a duet version of [...] "I Kissed a Girl", which included her [...] "rubbing up against" [...] Kravitz and flames exploding behind them. During these three songs, Perry was clothed in a [...] "flame-adorned" [...] dress, with her black hair in a ponytail. The costume has been described as the [...] "clothing equivalent of a flame", and [...] "dress of fire". The stage and field rendering transitioned into a [...] "breezy" [...] beach setting, with dancers dressed as sharks, palm trees and smiling beach balls dancing around Perry. She underwent a wardrobe change, and progressed into a [...] "campy" [...] medley of [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and [...] "California Gurls". Rapper Missy Elliott subsequently appeared, performing her songs [...] "Get Ur Freak On" [...] and [...] "Work It", while Perry played [...] "hype-woman" [...] beside her, having now changed once again into a custom Super Bowl 49 jersey. After Perry briefly disappeared, Elliott performed [...] "Lose Control". Perry returned, now sporting a [...] "star-encrusted gown" [...] for her closing song, [...] "Firework".

5000|$|The prologue {{opens with}} a mystery person's {{point of view on}} {{knowledge}}, power and killing, [...] "People say that knowledge is power. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> knowledge, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> power. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> winning numbers for the lottery? You would run to the store. And you would win. Same for the stock market. You're not talking about a trend or a percentage game or a whisper or a tip. You're talking about knowledge. Real, hard knowledge. You would buy. Then later you'd sell, and you'd be rich. Any kind of sports at all, if you could predict the future, you'd be home and dry. Same for anything. Same for killing people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, as you say, {{a terrible}} power," [...] she {{answered}} gravely, [...] "and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{of it the}} more terrible will it seem to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{she should}} be put out over that," [...] said Tom slowly. [...] "But then girls are queer. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> them the less you {{understand}} them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{secret of}} thrift, I say, is knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{the more you}} can save {{yourself}} and that which belongs to you; and can do more work with less effort.|$|E
60|$|It means <b>more</b> knowledge. <b>You</b> cannot {{meet any}} one without {{learning}} something from {{him if you}} keep your ears open and your eyes open. Every one {{is at least a}} little different from every one else, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> people <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> may learn. Peter Rabbit knows this, and that is one reason he always is so eager to find out about other people. He had left Jimmy Skunk and Bobby Coon in the Green Forest and had headed for the Smiling Pool to see if Grandfather Frog was awake yet. He had no idea of meeting a stranger there, and so you can imagine just how surprised he was when he got in sight of the Smiling Pool to see some one whom he never had seen before swimming about there. He knew right away who it was. He knew that it was Mrs. Quack the Duck, because he had often heard about her. And then, too, it was very clear from her looks that she was a cousin of the ducks he had seen in Farmer Brown's dooryard. The difference was that while they were big and white and stupid-looking, Mrs. Quack was smaller, brown, very trim, and looked anything but stupid.|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] Toussaint said. [...] "And now, I pray you, {{let there}} be no quarrel between us. I {{have been forced to}} {{withstand}} you, because I was bound by a sacred promise. Any divisions will be fatal to our cause. For the moment you may be in superior force, but another time those who love and follow me might be <b>the</b> <b>more</b> numerous. <b>You</b> well <b>know</b> that I am as faithful to the cause as you are, and we must both set an example to our followers, that while we may differ as to the methods by which success is to be gained, we are at one in our main object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe {{every single}} word {{he said to}} you was the truth," [...] said he, earnestly, [...] "and, mind you, I have {{something}} to go on when I speak like that. South America is a place I love, and I think, {{if you take it}} right through from Darien to Fuego, it's the grandest, richest, most wonderful bit of earth upon this planet. People don't know it yet, and don't realize what it may become. I've been up an' down it from end to end, and had two dry seasons in those very parts, as I told you when I spoke of the war I made on the slave-dealers. Well, when I was up there I heard some yarns of the same kind--traditions of Indians and the like, but with somethin' behind them, no doubt. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> of that country, young fellah, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> would understand that anythin' was possible--ANYTHIN'! There are just some narrow water-lanes along which folk travel, and outside that it is all darkness. Now, down here in the Matto Grande"--he swept his cigar over a part of the map--"or up in this corner where three countries meet, nothin' would surprise me. As that chap said to-night, there are fifty-thousand miles of water-way runnin' through a forest that is very near the size of Europe. You and I could be as far away from each other as Scotland is from Constantinople, and yet each of us be in the same great Brazilian forest. Man has just made a track here and a scrape there in the maze. Why, the river rises and falls the best part of forty feet, and half the country is a morass that you can't pass over. Why shouldn't somethin' new and wonderful lie in such a country? And why shouldn't we be the men to find it out? Besides," [...] he added, his queer, gaunt face shining with delight, [...] "there's a sportin' risk in every mile of it. I'm like an old golf-ball--I've had all the white paint knocked off me long ago. Life can whack me about now, and it can't leave a mark. But a sportin' risk, young fellah, that's the salt of existence. Then it's worth livin' again. We're all gettin' a deal too soft and dull and comfy. Give me the great waste lands and the wide spaces, with a gun in my fist and somethin' to look for that's worth findin'. I've tried war and steeplechasin' and aeroplanes, but this huntin' of beasts that look like a lobster-supper dream is a brand-new sensation." [...] He chuckled with glee at the prospect.|$|R
