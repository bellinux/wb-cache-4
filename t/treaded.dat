25|$|In 2017, Pirelli {{became the}} {{exclusive}} tire supplier (replacing Hoosier) and presenting sponsor for the Trans Am Series, and all classes use Pirelli P ZERO radial ply racing slicks. All Trans Am by Pirelli races go on {{even if it}} rains, in which case competitors may pit and change over to softer, <b>treaded</b> rain tires. The change from bias ply tires to Pirelli P ZERO radial tires has been very well received, and has resulted in faster average speeds and improved lap times in all four classes.|$|E

25|$|A1 Grands Prix of Nations {{took place}} over a three-day period, from Friday to Sunday. The teams were given five sets of dry weather slick tires, and two sets of wet weather <b>treaded</b> tires per weekend. However, if the weather was extreme, the team could be given more wet weather tires {{at the expense of}} the slick tires. The race weekend started with two one-hour {{practice}} sessions held on the Friday, and then another on the Saturday morning. A two-hour qualifying session took place on Saturday afternoon, and two races took place on Sunday. Primarily, the three practice sessions were for car setup and track familiarisation before the official competition began with Saturday qualifying. Three different drivers could participate in the three practice sessions; the driver elected for qualifying or for one of the races was required to have taken part in at least one such practice session.|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is likely}} that foveal {{information}} on <b>treads</b> provides important sensory cues for stair walking, it is unclear how gaze stabilization on <b>treads</b> contribute to gait control on stairs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which (i) stair walking depends on foveal information on stepped <b>treads,</b> (ii) fixated <b>treads</b> correspond to future foot landing locations, and (iii) the distance looked ahead varies with stepping distance. Gaze and foot position was monitored from six healthy young adults when they ascended and descended a 10 <b>tread</b> long staircase, taking the stairs one or two <b>treads</b> at a time. The results showed that 55 - 68 % of the total fixation time was aimed at <b>treads,</b> and that <b>tread</b> edges were fixated more intensively during stair descent (69 % of the total time spent fixating <b>treads)</b> than during stair ascent (48 %). A substantial 28 - 34 % of the stepped <b>treads</b> was never fixated and, when the staircase was taken two <b>treads</b> a time, approximately 35 % of the fixated <b>treads</b> was never stepped on. Subjects fixated 3. 5 - 4. 5 <b>treads</b> ahead in both stepping conditions, but when the staircase was taken 2 <b>treads</b> a time, stepped <b>treads</b> were fixated shorter ahead (2. 7 - 2. 9 <b>treads)</b> than <b>treads</b> that were not stepped (3. 4 - 4. 1 <b>treads).</b> These results provide new insights into the visual control of stair walking, and suggest that the stabilization of gaze on <b>treads</b> is not used solely to guide foot placement, but may serve other purposes as well, e. g., to facilitate postural control on the staircase.

25|$|In 2014, Brendan Gaughan {{and crew}} chief Shane Wilson moved {{up from the}} Truck Series to the Nationwide Series, {{bringing}} family-owned South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa and longtime number 62 with him. The team used the owners points of the No. 33 team from 2013; the No. 33 scaled back to part-time. Gaughan scored his first career Nationwide win at Road America in June, after struggling early and sliding off the track on several occasions, but gaining an advantage as downpours forced the competitors to switch to <b>treaded</b> rain tires. When pole-sitter Alex Tagliani ran out of fuel before a Green-White-Checkered finish, Gaughan assumed the lead and fended off Chase Elliott and a hard-charging Tagliani (on fresh slick tires). Brendan dedicated the win to his late grandfather Jackie Gaughan. Gaughan scored his second win of the season at Kentucky in September, passing teammate Ty Dillon on the final restart. Gaughan scored a total of seven top tens to finish eighth in points.|$|E
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and <b>treaded</b> tyres in the wet.|$|E
500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double wishbones. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two radius rods locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel disc brakes are used on all four wheels and were of [...] diameter for the smaller wheels and [...] for the larger ones. The car ran on <b>treaded</b> Goodyear tyres throughout its racing career.|$|E
50|$|<b>Treads</b> fall {{somewhere along}} the {{spectrum}} from smooth or slick to knobby. Smooth <b>treads</b> are intended for on-road use, where a <b>tread</b> pattern offers no improvement in traction. However, many otherwise slick tires have a light <b>tread</b> pattern, due to the common belief that a slick tire will be slippery in wet conditions. Knobby <b>treads</b> are intended for off-road use, where the <b>tread</b> texture can help improve traction on soft surfaces. Many <b>treads</b> are omnidirectional—the tire can be installed in either orientation—but some are unidirectional and designed to be oriented a certain way. Some tires, especially for mountain bikes, have a <b>tread</b> which is intended either for the front wheel or the rear wheel. A special <b>tread</b> pattern, with small dimples, has been developed to reduce air drag.|$|R

40|$|Wheel <b>treads</b> {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in <b>tread</b> profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale <b>tread</b> braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel <b>tread</b> profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and <b>tread</b> braking. The presented results show that the maximum <b>tread</b> depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel <b>tread</b> induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from <b>tread</b> braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the <b>tread</b> near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other <b>tread</b> area...|$|R

5000|$|A non-zero {{slip angle}} arises because of {{deformation}} in the tire carcass and <b>tread.</b> As the tire rotates, the {{friction between the}} contact patch and the road results in individual <b>tread</b> 'elements' (finite sections of <b>tread)</b> remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} road.

When a <b>tread</b> element enters the contact patch, the friction between the road and the tire causes the <b>tread</b> element to remain stationary, yet the tire continues to move laterally. Thus the <b>tread</b> element will be ‘deflected’ sideways.
