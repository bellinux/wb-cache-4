The Nuna is a solar car that won the World Solar Challenge (WSC) a few times. The objective {{of this paper is to}} model and quantify <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> in <b>the</b> drive system of the Nuna, to validate this model by means of measurements, and to use this model to investigate if a decrease of <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> is possible. <b>The</b> <b>losses</b> in <b>the</b> drive are modelled to determine the optimal solar car parameters. In this model <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> of various components of the drive are described with equations that are a function of determinable and measurable quantities. In this way the model is suitable for calculating <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> that occur during the driving of a trajectory with a certain load to the drive...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new surrogate loss function called orbit <b>loss</b> in <b>the</b> structured prediction framework, which has good theoretical and practical advantages. While <b>the</b> orbit <b>loss</b> is not convex, it has a simple analytical gradient and a simple perceptron-like learning rule. We analyze <b>the</b> new <b>loss</b> theoretically and state a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound. We also prove that <b>the</b> new <b>loss</b> is consistent in the strong sense; namely, the risk achieved by {{the set of the}} trained parameters approaches the infimum risk achievable by any linear decoder over the given features. Methods that are aimed at risk minimization, such as <b>the</b> structured ramp <b>loss,</b> <b>the</b> structured probit <b>loss</b> and <b>the</b> direct <b>loss</b> minimization require at least two inference operations per training iteration. In this sense, <b>the</b> orbit <b>loss</b> is more efficient as it requires only one inference operation per training iteration, while yields similar performance. We conclude the paper with an empirical comparison of <b>the</b> proposed <b>loss</b> function to <b>the</b> structured hinge <b>loss,</b> <b>the</b> structured ramp <b>loss,</b> <b>the</b> structured probit <b>loss</b> and <b>the</b> direct <b>loss</b> minimization method on several benchmark datasets and tasks...|$|R
