He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|E
500|$|A year later, at the 2010 Canadian Open, Raonic and Pospisil {{were given}} a doubles {{wildcard}} to the main draw, marking Raonic's first ever ATP World Tour doubles match. They won their first round match against Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. It was {{first time that the}} world Nos. 1 and 2 had played together in a tour doubles match since Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe did so in 1976. In the second round, Raonic and Pospisil lost to reigning Wimbledon doubles champions Jürgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner. After the match, Raonic said: [...] "Our goal here is pretty much as ambassadors to Canada.

Adamson's statement made headlines, and was thought to have damaged the Conservative Party's election prospects. Adamson's statement was repudiated by CBI President Sir Michael Clapham, and he offered to resign (the offer was refused).|$|E

Zikode clarified that [...] "Abahlali are not joining DA or any political party. We will remain independent from all kinds of mainstream political parties.

5000|$|Žižek freely {{associates}} {{between the}} prohibition on real tears in Kieślowski to the Old Testament ban on images {{in order to}} remove degrading over-visibility from ethical significance.

The example Žižek uses is that of a computer nerd who, as part of an interactive online game, adopts the persona of a sadistic murderer. It is not the case, claims Žižek, that this choice of persona hides a meek character beneath the fiction but, rather, that [...] "in the guise of a fiction, the truth about geek is articulated" [...] (TFRT, p. 75).|$|R
