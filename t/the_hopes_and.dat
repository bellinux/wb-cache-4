25|$|Psychic Readings Live was a {{phone-in}} programme broadcast June–December 2012.

25|$|As the Istari were Maiar, {{each one}} served a Vala in some way. Saruman was the servant and helper of Aulë, and so learned {{much in the}} art of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manwë or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of Lórien, and so knew much of <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> dreams of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved the things of nature, both Kelvar and Olvar. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue was}} {{contrived}} that the Protestant party (Du Plessis Mornay) could {{not fail to}} lose. By concurring with this decision, Casaubon confirmed the Protestants' suspicions that, like his friend and patron, Philippe Canaye, he was contemplating abjuration. From then on, he became the object of <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> fears of the two religions; the Catholics lavishing promises and plying him with arguments; the Protestant ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing cause, and only haggling about his price. Neither side could understand that Casaubon's reading of the church fathers led him to adopt an intermediate position between Genevan Calvinism and Ultramontanism.|$|E
25|$|Finan (2003) says Smith is an underestimated {{symbol of}} the {{changing}} nature of American politics {{in the first half of}} the last century. He represented the rising ambitions of urban, industrial America at a time when the hegemony of rural, agrarian America was in decline, although many states had legislatures and congressional delegations biased toward rural areas because of lack of redistricting after censuses. Smith was connected to <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> aspirations of immigrants, especially Catholics and Jews from eastern and southern Europe. Smith was a devout Catholic, but his struggles against religious bigotry were often misinterpreted when he fought the religiously inspired Protestant morality imposed by prohibitionists.|$|E

25|$|By private interviews, wrote a Roman Catholic {{historian}} {{who was also}} bishop of Przemyśl, which they could always command, the Jesuits so bound the king by their solicitations that he did everything according to their counsel, and <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> cares of courtiers had no weight except by their favour. Chief among these advisers of the king was Piotr Skarga, {{one of the most}} eminent of Polish Jesuits. Born in Mazovia in 1536, he was educated at the Jagiellonian University, where he distinguished himself by receiving an academic degree prima Laurea. He then proceeded to Rome, where he entered the society in 1568. He began his preaching at Pułtusk, and visited the colleges that Stephen Báthory had founded at Riga, Dorpat and Połock; his eloquence was very successful, and even now his sermons are thought highly of in Poland. On the accession of Sigismund he became royal chaplain and he founded a confraternity of St. Lazarus in Warsaw and many other establishments elsewhere in the country.|$|E

They never saw one another as children {{and he did not}} know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a [...] "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant.

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{following}} {{clashes between}} {{security forces and}} students, the government accused al-Jamri of having links to Iran and seeking to establish an [...] "Islamic republic" [...] in Bahrain. Al-Jamri denied the accusations. Nevertheless, on 1 April the government imposed a blockade on al-Jamri's home of Bani Jamra, placing him and 18 {{members of his family}} under house arrest. At least one man was killed and 16 others injured during clashes with police. That day became known locally as the Black Saturday. Two weeks later, al-Jamri was transferred to a detention center. Along with other opposition figures he was released on 25 September 1995, following a deal with the government to calm down the situation in return for opening up talks on the restoration of parliament. Tens of thousands of Bahrainis gathered to welcome al-Jamri following his release. He gave a speech in which he promised to stay loyal to <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> sufferings of the Bahraini people.|$|E

500|$|As a youth, Newton began {{a pattern}} of coming very close to death, {{examining}} his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, [...] "Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> comforts of the Gospel {{at the very time}} when every other comfort was about to fail me." [...] His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary [...] "Polly" [...] Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.|$|E
500|$|The {{consequences}} of defeat, however, were severe for the Democratic Party. [...] The 1896 presidential race {{is generally considered}} a realigning election, {{when there is a}} major shift in voting patterns, upsetting the political balance. [...] McKinley was supported by middle-class and wealthy voters, urban laborers, and prosperous farmers; this coalition would keep the Republicans mostly in power until the 1930s. The election of 1896 marked a transition as the concerns of the rural population became secondary to those of the urban; according to Stanley Jones, [...] "the Democratic Party reacted with less sensitivity than the Republicans to <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> fears of the new voters which the new age was producing". [...] This was evidenced in the tariff question: Bryan spent little time addressing it, stating that it was subsumed in the financial issue; Republican arguments that the protective tariff would benefit manufacturers appealed to urban workers and went unrebutted by the Democrats.|$|E
500|$|With little {{practical}} {{support from}} CEMA, Imogen's organisational talents, {{according to her}} friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, [...] "developed brilliantly". According to Imogen's account, her duties included conducting local brass bands, leading hymn-singing practice ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round {{the edge of a}} dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged [...] performances by professional groups, and what she termed [...] "drop-in-and-sing" [...] festivals in which anyone could join. [...] Imogen also writes of [...] "idyllic days" [...] spent over cups of tea, discussing <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> dreams of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the Offley and Deddington suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs. By the summer of 1942 the workload and concomitant bureaucracy was such that she was exhausted, and in need of a lengthy rest.|$|E
