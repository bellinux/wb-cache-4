5|$|A <b>timer</b> {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The <b>timer</b> was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the <b>timer.</b> At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown <b>timer,</b> during which the door is open. Once the <b>timer</b> is active, the player must get to the door before the <b>timer</b> ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} using TTCN3 for real time testing {{is because of}} its <b>timers.</b> These <b>timers</b> are defined in {{function}} test suites. There are no any global kind <b>timers</b> used in TTCN3. These <b>timers</b> can be started, stopped and checked using simple functions like timer.start, timer.stop, and timer.read.|$|R
50|$|Yohsuke's defeat {{causes the}} Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance {{to leave his}} body, as well as {{changing}} Yohsuke into a man. The Inheritance, undeterred, approaches Ayano. Ayano is granted power by the Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance, and assists Zenga in his plan {{to return to the}} beginning of time using the Old <b>Timer's</b> Chronos System. Ayano tells Yohko to kill her in order to stop the Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance, and thus the Old <b>Timer's</b> Chronos system from destroying the universe. Yohko, however, manages to defeat Ayano without killing her, causing the Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance to leave Ayano.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the <b>timer</b> to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the <b>timer</b> has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the <b>timer</b> passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien mothership, that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a <b>timer</b> counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the <b>timer</b> reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the saucers are positioned.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses. In addition, What's Cooking? {{can be used}} as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it can act as a <b>timer</b> to count down from a specified time and make an audible sound when it is done.|$|E

5|$|The {{light on}} the small rock of Oxcars was {{automated}} as early as 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork <b>timer</b> and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks. A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The vkernel runs {{on top of}} {{hardware}} abstractions provided by the real kernel. These include the kqueue-based <b>timer,</b> the console (mapped to the virtual terminal where vkernel is executed), the disk image and virtual kernel Ethernet device (VKE), tunneling all packets to the host's tap interface.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} explosions in taxis caused by <b>timer</b> bombs. The first one {{occurred}} at 22:40 at Vile Parle, killing {{the driver and}} a passenger. The second explosion took place at Wadi Bunder between 22:20 and 22:25. Three people, including {{the driver of the}} taxi were killed, and about 15 others were injured.|$|E
50|$|In the past, these {{electromechanical}} <b>timers</b> {{were often}} combined with electrical relays to create electro-mechanical controllers. Electromechanical <b>timers</b> reached a high state {{of development in}} the 1950s and 1960s because of their extensive use in aerospace and weapons systems. Programmable electromechanical <b>timers</b> controlled launch sequence events in early rockets and ballistic missiles. As digital electronics has progressed and dropped in price, electronic <b>timers</b> have become more advantageous.|$|R
50|$|The Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance later {{possesses}} Madoka, however Yohko {{laughs at}} the futility of the Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance, and their unstable Chronos system when compared to Lawson's system. Realizing Yohko to be right, the Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance agrees with what she said.|$|R
50|$|Countdown <b>timers</b> on {{traffic lights}} were {{introduced}} in the 1990s. <b>Timers</b> are useful for pedestrians, to plan whether there is enough time to cross the intersection {{before the end of}} the walk phase, and for drivers, to know the amount of time before the light turns green. In the United States, <b>timers</b> for vehicle traffic are prohibited, but pedestrian <b>timers</b> are now required on new or upgraded signals on wider roadways.|$|R
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the <b>timer,</b> Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the <b>timer</b> run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short <b>timer</b> that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second <b>timer</b> runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the <b>timer</b> reach zero {{to advance to the}} next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.|$|E
50|$|PITs may be {{one-shot}} or periodic. One-shot <b>timers</b> will signal {{only once}} and then stop counting. Periodic <b>timers</b> signal every time they reach a specific value and then restart, thus producing a signal at periodic intervals. Periodic <b>timers</b> are typically used to invoke activities that must be performed at regular intervals.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{classification of}} dashpot <b>timers</b> are mercury-displacement <b>timers.</b> These {{depend on the}} displacement of a pool of mercury that make connection with two electrodes. There {{are two kinds of}} mercury displacement <b>timers,</b> delayed-make displacement <b>timers</b> and slow break displacement <b>timers.</b> Delayed-make displacement <b>timers</b> work by having a plunger floating in a container of mercury, when energy is applied to the coil it pulls the plunger into its center. The mercury that is displaced by this enters the thimble though an orifice. Inert gas trapped {{at the top of the}} thimble prevents the mercury from rising. Eventually the gas escapes through a ceramic plug, and this permits mercury to fill the thimble. When the mercury rises to a certain level it makes contact between electrodes. The amount of delay that this produces is determined when it is manufactured. Slow-break displacement <b>timers</b> work in the same way as delayed-make displacement <b>timers</b> only that when the coil is de-energized, the plunger rises to its original position, and mercury flows through the orifice to reach outside level. when it falls below the lip of the ceramic cup, electrical contacts become open. Its physical size is used to regulate the delay time of connection break. These <b>timers</b> are designed with a fixed delay period, usually to a maximum of 20 minutes.|$|R

5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running <b>timer,</b> and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 {{aerobatic}} flight simulator video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a <b>timer</b> or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3a was {{released}} on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for <b>timer</b> control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.|$|E
40|$|During the UD's and CCNY's ongoing {{effort to}} {{generate}} conformance tests for the Army network protocol MIL-STD 188 - 220, a significant obstacle has been addressed [...] -when multiple <b>timers</b> are running simultaneously, a test sequence may become unrealizable {{if there are}} conflicting conditions based on a protocol's <b>timers.</b> This problem, termed the conflicting <b>timers</b> problem, is handled in the hitherto generated tests by manually expanding a protocol's extended FSM based {{on the set of}} conflicting <b>timers,</b> resulting in test sequences that are far from minimum-length. Similar inconsistencies, but based on arbitrary linear variables, are present in the extended FSMs modeling VHDL specifications. This paper presents an efficient solution to the conflicting <b>timers</b> problem that eliminates the redundancies of manual state expansion. CCNY's inconsistency removal algorithms are applied to a new model for real-time protocols with multiple <b>timers.</b> The new model captures complex timing dependencies by usin [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Informant Michael Marks awakens in a {{room with}} a spike-filled mask locked to his neck. A {{videotape}} informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key, which has been surgically implanted and sealed behind it. He sets off the <b>timer</b> and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added <b>timer</b> and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a <b>timer</b> clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{pedestrian}} signals, {{traffic lights}} are now equipped with countdown <b>timers,</b> too. There were red-light and green-light <b>timers,</b> but {{the latter were}} mostly taken down due to the accidents they induced by encouraging drivers to speed up as the green-light <b>timers</b> ended. As for red-light <b>timers,</b> they cannot only inform the time remains for waiting but also make the drivers focus on their own signal instead of green light of the other direction. This reduces clashes between cars that start too early and cars that run yellow light.|$|R
40|$|In {{considering}} {{systems of}} distributed processes, we {{must deal with}} access to re-sources, locations and communication among processes. In this paper we present a new model for timed coordination of communicating distributed processes using {{an extension of the}} pi-calculus with locations, types and <b>timers.</b> Types are used to express restricted access to distributed resources. <b>Timers</b> define timeouts for both communication channels and resources. Coordination is given by these <b>timers,</b> to-gether with additional coordination rules. We define the syntax of the model and its operational semantics and then provide some results regarding the typing system and the <b>timers.</b> A timed barbed bisimulation relation is defined to compare the processes in different settings. The timed coordination aspects are given through a coordinator pair. It consists of a <b>timers</b> assigning function which can be dynami-cally changed, and a set of coordination rules. Some illustrative examples are given. Finally we compare the new model with other existing coordination models. Key words: <b>timers,</b> typing system, locations, pi-calculus...|$|R
