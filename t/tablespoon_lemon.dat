40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to effects of garlic and lemon juice mixture on lipid profile and some cardiovascular risk factors in people 30 - 60 years old with moderate hyperlipidemia. Methods: In a parallel-designed randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 112 hyperlipidemic patients 30 - 60 years, were recruited from Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. People were selected and randomly divided into four groups. Control blood samples were taken and height, weight, and blood pressure were recorded. (1) Received 20 g of garlic daily, plus 1 <b>tablespoon</b> <b>lemon</b> juice, (2) received 20 g garlic daily, (3) received 1 tablespoon of lemon juice daily, and (4) did not receive garlic or lemon juice. A study technician was done the random allocations using a random numbers table. All participants presented 3 days of dietary records and 3 days of physical activity records during 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at study baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. Results: Results showed {{a significant decrease in}} total cholesterol (changes from baseline: 40. 8 ± 6. 1, P 0 < 0. 001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (29. 8 ± 2. 6, P < 0. 001), and fibrinogen (111. 4 ± 16. 1, P < 0. 001) in the Group 1, in comparison with other groups. A greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in Group 1 compared with the Groups 3 and 4 (37 ± 10, P = 0. 01) (24 ± 1, P = 0. 02); respectively. Furthermore, a great reduction in body mass index was observed in the mixed group compared with the lemon juice and control groups (1. 6 ± 0. 1, P = 0. 04). Conclusions: Administration of garlic plus lemon juice resulted in an improvement in lipid levels, fibrinogen and blood pressure of patients with hyperlipidemia...|$|E
