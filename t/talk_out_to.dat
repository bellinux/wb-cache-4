[...] He touched off the emperor in a few pithy words, the German press, the German people, and our own. He put it as we should put it all now, but with a certain heat as of a man half guilty and wholly resentful. [...] "Their damned little buttoned-up professors!" [...] he cried, incidentally.

Skinner later described this as his proudest political movement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} told in a stream of {{consciousness}} because the boy, Isabel, and the colonel tell the reader a trail of thoughts as they appear in their mind. These internal monologues provide the information that puts {{the pieces of the}} story together as the story starts off at the doctor’s death and not his life. Because the stream of consciousness is used, it enables the characters to jump back and forth in time without ever leaving their present moment, which is at the wake of the doctor. Also due to this narrative technique the illusion is given that these characters are <b>talking</b> <b>out</b> aloud <b>to</b> each other when in fact very little interaction actually takes place between them.|$|R

Then one of the Kaffirs, bolder than the rest, struck up the barrels with his arm, and not too soon, for whether or no he had meant to pull the trigger, the rifle went off.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} self-recording on {{classroom}} behavior of two {{junior high school}} students was investigated. In the first experiment, study behavior of an eighth-grade girl in history class was recorded. Following baseline observations her counselor provided slips for the girl to record {{whether or not she}} studied in class. This resulted in an increase in study. When slips were withdrawn, study decreased and then increased once self-recording was reinstated. After teacher praise for study was increased, self-recording was discontinued without significant losses in study behavior. In the final phase, increased praise was also withdrawn and study remained at a high level. In the second experiment, the number of <b>talk</b> <b>outs</b> emitted by an eighth-grade boy were recorded during math period. Following baseline, slips for recording <b>talk</b> <b>outs</b> were issued {{for the first half of}} the period, for the second half, and then for the entire period. <b>Talk</b> <b>outs</b> decreased when self-recording was in effect and increased again when self-recording was discontinued. When self-recording was reinstituted in the final phase there was a slight, though not significant decrease in <b>talking</b> <b>out</b> when compared <b>to</b> the baseline condition...|$|R

The five find a seashell before they are attacked by Space Biker Helmedor who wants the shell to fulfill his dreams, overpowering the Megarangers before Mega Silver arrives and engages the biker in a motorcyclists' duel. Suddenly enlarging with his bike, Helmedor battles Super Galaxy Mega before he is forced to shrink and retreat. Later, while trying <b>to</b> find <b>out</b> the seashell's true nature, Miku uses it to wish for a big cake before it is stolen by a group of strange students who actually are the staff of the Pegasus Garage. But with Mega Yellow placing a tracer on the getaway car, the Megarangers track them to the Pegasus Garage where Kyousuke wishes for Katsudon before he and his team are attacked by Yugande and Kani Nejilar. Refusing to stand aside, they assume their Carranger forms to fight Kani Nejilar while the Megarangers deal with Yugande and the Kunekune. The two Sentai teams join forces to force the Nejireians back as the shell opens up to reveal an alien identified as Space Fairy Picot who wants to grant their last three wishes.

He is not now in his own humble little parish, preaching simply to the hoers of corn and {{planters}} of potatoes, but there sits Governor D., and there is Judge R., and Counsellor P., and Judge G. In short, he is before a refined and literary audience. But Father Morris rises; he thinks nothing of this; he cares nothing; he knows nothing, as he himself would say, but [...] "Jesus Christ, and him crucified." [...] He takes a passage of Scripture to explain; perhaps it is the walk to Emmaus, and the conversation of Jesus with his disciples. Immediately the whole start out before you, living and picturesque: the road to Emmaus is a New England turnpike; you can see its mile stones, its mullein stalks, its toll gates. Next the disciples rise, and you have before you all their anguish, and hesitation, and dismay <b>talked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you {{in the language of}} your own fireside. You smile; you are amused; yet you are touched, and the illusion grows every moment. You see the approaching stranger, and the mysterious conversation grows more and more interesting. Emmaus {{rises in the}} distance, in the likeness of a New England village, with a white meeting house and spire. You follow the travellers; you enter the house with them; nor do you wake from your trance until, with streaming eyes, the preacher tells you that [...] "they saw it was the Lord Jesus--and what a pity it was they could not have known it before!" ...|$|R

60|$|The July {{heat was}} ever more stifling. They crawled along Main Street by day; {{they found it}} hard to sleep at night.

Ten times a night they <b>talked</b> of going <b>out</b> <b>to</b> soak themselves with the hose and wade through the dew, but they were too listless to take the trouble.

After a silence {{the justice of}} the peace informed Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee, {{on the part of the}} Democratic party, to ask him to run for mayor--for the little town was about to become a city and the first charter election was approaching. It was the first attention which Wilson had ever received at the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble one, but it was a recognition of his debut into the town's life and activities at last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply gratified. He accepted, and the committee departed, followed by young Tom.|$|R

60|$|They at {{once took}} {{possession}} {{of one of}} the empty huts, which was just as it was left by its proprietor. One of the women brought a brand or two from her hearth. An earthen cooking pot was filled with water and placed above it, and a few handfuls of rice dropped in.

60|$|Finally, {{as there}} seemed to be no other remedy, our old friend Quicksilver was sent post haste to King Pluto, in hopes that he might be persuaded to undo the {{mischief}} he had done, and to set everything right again, by giving up Proserpina. Quicksilver accordingly made the best of his way to the great gate, took a flying leap right over the three-headed mastiff, and stood at the door of the palace in an inconceivably short time. The servants knew him both by his face and garb; for his short cloak, and his winged cap and shoes, and his snaky staff had often been seen thereabouts in times gone by. He requested to be shown immediately into the king's presence; and Pluto, who heard his voice from the top of the stairs, and who loved to recreate himself with Quicksilver's merry <b>talk,</b> called <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him to come up. And while they settle their business together, we must inquire what Proserpina has been doing ever since we saw her last.|$|R

Dominguez's character is light-hearted, often making witty, off-the-cuff observations at crime scenes. He has a penchant for getting involved in get-rich quick schemes, often having to be rescued by Nash. The details of Nash & Dominguez's relationship (and why they are such close friends,) is revealed {{during the course of the}} series: As a young cop with a bright future, Dominguez ruined his reputation by being busted for a DUI. The only person to stand by him was his partner at the time, later revealed to be Nash. In later seasons, Nash & Joe form a private detective agency to make extra money.|$|R
