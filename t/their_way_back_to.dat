5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
60|$|Once Rachel asked vaguely {{what became}} of these outworn and snake-poisoned men, and Noie only {{shook her head in}} answer, for she did not think fit to tell her that they were left <b>to</b> find <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back,</b> or <b>to</b> perish, as might chance.|$|R

5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5000|$|At {{most of the}} Moody Blues' concerts, [...] "Ride My See-Saw" [...] is the encore {{presentation}} {{at the end of}} the shows.

5000|$|On 21 November 1943, Due to riots, open strikes, {{the armed}} {{rebellion}} of Ain Anoub and the interference of Arab and Western states (mainly Britain), the political prisoners were released. 3The freed prisoners passed by Bechamoun on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> home, <b>to</b> thank the rebels.

60|$|There was not, {{it may be}} well {{to remark}} here, so much danger in this sally as we moderns might suppose, for, even though the savages had not run, but had faced and {{surrounded}} their enemy, these Norsemen, with their massive limbs, sweeping swords, large shields, and defensive armour, could have cut <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> the fort through hundreds of such half-naked foes.|$|R
5|$|Irataba {{moved on}} to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; {{government}} officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he and Moss sailed to California, again by way of Panama, and made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January AjKowoj, {{the king}} of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño, arguing against the {{acceptance}} of Christianity and Spanish rule. The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ek' and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza – and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj. The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish. The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake Petén Itzá. The Franciscans were shown a path that led to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño's companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Chuntuki and from there made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mérida.|$|E

Buford's enterprise provided {{one of the few}} bright moments in what was a less damaging campaign than expected, although the Northern press hailed the incursion in glowing terms.|$|R
50|$|As {{the crew}} make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> the Science Room, their journey is {{interrupted}} by a sudden loss of power. Kryten is then employed as a battering-ram {{to get through the}} 53 electronically locked doors between the crew and the Science Room. Once the crew get there, they discover why Holly has decided to power down the ship and place everything on emergency back-up power only.|$|R

5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition {{to the source of}} Shaw's signal. At the entrance of the crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne mutagen to be inhaled through his nose. By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the lander, Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching the lander, which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E

When it reaches the last hiccup, Jimmy/Dr Noah's atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale with everyone inside. Sir James {{and all of his}} agents then appear in heaven, and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to hell.|$|E

40|$|Islamic feminism/s as {{forms of}} consciousness, thinking, and {{practice}} are ascendant, yet {{in many places}} they still all too often go unnoticed. In Bosnia rising generations of Muslim women and men emerging from an atheistic past and the horrors of war are finding <b>their</b> own <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Islam. In the process, and with a heightened awareness of justice and sensitivity to gender, they are coming to Islamic feminism as voices from Sarajevo tell us...|$|R
