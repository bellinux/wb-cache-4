5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017.

On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible.
