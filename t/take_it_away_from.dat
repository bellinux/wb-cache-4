5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a hammer, and the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a {{sledgehammer}} into the ring, Foley attempted to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man follows Dr. Octopus to TriCorp, {{where he}} {{attempts}} to steal a power pack from a vault. Spider-Man swoops in and gets to the power source before him. He then runs out, with Dr. Octopus pursuing him, hoping to cause the doctor {{to run out of}} energy. They reach Coney Island through their ensuing brawl and Octopus, aware of Spider-Man's desire to save innocent lives, kidnaps Liz. With only an hour of energy left, he climbs {{to the top of a}} roller coaster, forcing Spider-Man to choose between the power pack and Liz. Spider-Man throws the pack in the air before rescuing Liz; he gets close to Dr. Octopus as the latter scrambles for the power pack and is able to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, successfully defeating the doctor.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of our ancestors and for the welfare of our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins {{inherits}} the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin and guardian. Neither hobbit {{is aware of the}} Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring. Many years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener and friend, Samwise ("Sam") Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, called Merry, and Peregrin Took, called Pippin. They are nearly caught by the Black Riders but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.|$|E
25|$|Brown was {{accompanied}} by the sheriff and his assistants, but no minister since he had consistently rejected the ministrations of pro-slavery clergy. Since the region was in the grips of virtual hysteria, most northerners, including journalists, were run out of town, and it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even {{if one were to}} have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at 11:50 a.m. His body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck. His coffin was then put on a train to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Virginia to his family homestead in New York for burial. In the North, large memorial meetings took place, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, and famous writers such as Emerson and Thoreau joined many Northerners in praising Brown.|$|E
500|$|The {{final time}} {{trial in the}} 1993 Giro d'Italia was [...] in length and had a summit finish on the famous climb of the Sestriere. Miguel Indurain won the leg and {{extended}} his lead {{over the rest of}} the field. The penultimate stage featured a [...] climb to Oropa. Second overall Piotr Ugrumov attacked multiple times on the final climb of the day to gain time on Indurain; he attacked one last time and Indurain could not match his move. Massimo Ghirotto was the first rider to cross the finish line, with Ugrumov finishing in fifth and Indurain in tenth. Ugrumov gained 40 seconds on Indurain's lead, but it was not good enough to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Spaniard. The final stage was a primarily flat course that stretched from Biella to Milan. The leg culminated with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. Indurain had won his second consecutive Giro d'Italia.|$|E

500|$|In November 1999, Overmars scored {{his first}} hat-trick for Arsenal, {{at home to}} Middlesbrough. His {{performance}} was lauded by journalist Lynne Truss, who wrote in The Times, [...] "Overmars was in top Jack Russell form, bounding after the ball and prepared to savage anybody who tried to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him." [...] He twisted his ankle in action for Arsenal against Sheffield Wednesday in January 2000 and was out of action for six weeks. Unlike the previous two seasons, Arsenal never did pose {{a serious threat to}} Manchester United, who went on to retain the league in 1999–2000. Overmars had suggested before the campaign that Arsenal were as strong as their rivals, [...] "especially in attack where we now have so many more options". Arsenal ended the league season strongly, winning eight games in a row between March and May to move from fifth to second place. In April 2000, Overmars scored the winning goal against Everton and was the standout performer in the game. His final game for Arsenal was the 2000 UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray, which they lost 4–1 on penalties after a goalless draw.|$|E
2500|$|The end to Special Category Status was {{a serious}} threat to the {{authority}} which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow. The imminent withdrawal of Special Category Status caused relations between the prisoners and prison officers to deteriorate, and in early 1976 the IRA leaders in prison sent word to the IRA Army Council asking them to begin assassinating prison officers, stating [...] "we are prepared to die for political status. Those who try to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> us must be fully prepared to pay the same price". Outside the prison the IRA responded by shooting prison officer Patrick Dillon in April 1976, the first of nineteen prison officers to be killed during the five-year protest.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} American heiresses of the period, Alice had not allowed {{her family to}} arrange an {{advantageous}} match for her, choosing {{to take the initiative}} and pursue a romance with Comte de Janzé on her own. After a romance of only three weeks, the couple married on 21 September 1921 in Chicago, with her new husband reportedly finding her [...] "Silverthorne" [...] surname so charming that he regretted their marriage would <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her. Following the ceremony, Alice's aunt, Mrs. J. Ogden Armour, turned over the Armour estate on Long Island to the couple, where they spent two weeks before deciding to permanently settle in Paris, in the Champs-Élysées quarter. Their marriage produced two daughters, Nolwén Louise Alice de Janzé (20 June 1922 – 7 March 1989) and Paola Marie Jeanne de Janzé (1 June 1924 – 24 December 2006). Alice was a neglectful mother as Frederic was a neglectful father; the children were primarily brought up in their family chateau in Normandy by governesses and Frédéric's sister.|$|E
