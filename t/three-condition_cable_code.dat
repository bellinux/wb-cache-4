50|$|Cassel left England in 1889 {{and went}} to Havana for an English and New York {{newspaper}} syndicate to report the Mikhail Tchigorin-Gunsberg match. In 1890 {{he went to the}} United States and was offered a job at the New Yorker Staatszeitung. He wrote about chess not only in that paper, but also in the New York Tribune and wrote a special chess column nearly every Sunday for The New York Sun. He was instrumental in establishing the Staats-Zeitung and Rice trophies, and arranged, among other important contests, the first cable match between the Manhattan Chess Club and the British Chess Club in 1895, the forerunner of the Anglo-American series. He was the inventor of a chess <b>cable</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

Located near the , the building has long {{been used as a}} fishing lodge. After the death of his wife in 1896, Stephen never returned to Grand-Métis, feeling incapable of fishing without her at his side. Since he had no children of his own, he loaned Estevan Lodge to his business associates and his family. For several of American’s wealthiest men, Estevan Lodge was a favourite fishing haunt. And one of the most frequent visitors was Stephen’ niece, Elsie Reford.|$|R

50|$|The first telegraphic codes were {{developed}} {{shortly after the}} advent of the telegraph, and spread rapidly: in 1854, one eighth of telegrams transmitted between New York and New Orleans were written in <b>code.</b> <b>Cable</b> tolls were charged by the word, and telegraph companies counted codewords like any other words, so a carefully constructed code could reduce message lengths enormously.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Appendix I of the {{standard}} ITU-T G. 975 contains several codes that have been proposed for improved performance of optical transmission. While the original application was submarine <b>cables,</b> the <b>codes</b> are now also used in terrestrial systems where wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is introduced. Currently codes suitable for data rates of 100 Gbits/sec in each channel are being studied. We discuss performance limits for codes with the speci ed block lengths of about 130, 000 and rates about 15 / 16. The most promising codes appear to be modi ed product codes, and iterated decoding is used in several cases. We discuss the construction, decoding, and performance of such codes. I...|$|R

Printed materials in the collection include: magazines, reprints and extracts; newspaper clippings, many of which deal with Jacques Cousteau and the Cousteau Society; newsletters; directories; diving equipment catalogs; a private <b>cable</b> <b>code</b> book from 1955; programs and brochures; and several books, including an oversize volume [...] "Greek Ships of 1821". Audiovisual materials in the collection include: reel-to-reel audio tapes, including interviews (Admiral Momsen on submarines; and Jacques Cousteau), talks, meeting of the MAVC convention, 1961, and audio of sounds made by the Weddell seal; film reels, including footage of the dive at Fontaine de Vaucluse; {{and a number of}} commercial videos related to marine subjects. Records related to the United States Liaison Committee for Oceanographic Research includes Ruth and James Dugan correspondence.

Other materials in the collection include: typescripts of articles and other writings; multiple copies of a brochure written by Dugan for an extermination company; plans for an underwater exhibit at the Philadelphia Maritime Museum, 1974; and several maps and charts, including a chart of New York Harbor, the ocean floor, and other locations; a can of Evian water; a diving mask; and a metal valve handle.|$|R
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of warfare in Europe in 1914, foreign powers with significant economic and strategic interests in Mexico - particularly the U.S., Great Britain, and Germany - made efforts to sway Mexico to their side, but Mexico in World War I maintained a policy of neutrality. In the Zimmermann Telegram, a <b>coded</b> <b>cable</b> from the German government to Carranza's government, Germany attempted to draw Mexico into war with the United States, which was itself neutral at the time. Carranza did not pursue this policy, but the leaking of the telegram pushed the U.S. into war against Germany in 1917.|$|R

40|$|The article raises {{political}} {{questions about}} the ways in which data has been constituted as an object vested with certain powers, influence, and rationalities. We place the emergence and transformation of professional practices such as ‘data science’, ‘data journalism’, ‘data brokerage’, ‘data mining’, ‘data storage’, and ‘data analysis’ as part of the reconfiguration of a series of fields of power and knowledge in the public and private accumulation of data. Data Politics asks {{questions about the}} ways in which data has become such an object of power and explores how to critically intervene in its deployment as an object of knowledge. It is concerned with the conditions of possibility of data that involve things (infrastructures of servers, devices, and <b>cables),</b> language (<b>code,</b> programming, and algorithms) and people (scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, information technologists, designers) that together create new worlds. We define ‘data politics’ as both the articulation of political questions about these worlds and the ways in which they provoke subjects to govern themselves and others by making rights claims. We contend that without understanding these conditions of possibility – of worlds, subjects and rights – it would be difficult to intervene in or shape data politics if by that it’s meant the transformation of data subjects into data citizens...|$|R

50|$|She {{had access}} to the Polish {{diplomatic}} pouch and was able to send <b>coded</b> <b>cables</b> to her contacts in Va’ad Hatzalah (Rescue Committee) in the United States and Turkey. One important use of this channel was the Sternbuchs alerting the New York Va’ad Hatzalah on 2 September 1942 to the horrors of the Holocaust and reinforced the 8 August 1942 Gerhardt Riegner cable. It was sent to alert American Jewry to the reality of the Holocaust and led to a meeting of 34 Jewish organizations. The Polish diplomatic pouch was also used to send secret messages, money to Jews in Nazi occupied Europe and as bribes for rescue. Recha Sternbuch also developed good connections with the Papal Nuncio to Switzerland, Monsignor Phillippe Bernadini, dean of the Swiss diplomatic community. He gave her access to Vatican couriers for sending money and messages to Jewish and resistance organizations in Nazi occupied Europe.
