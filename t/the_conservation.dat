5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. <b>The</b> <b>conservation</b> aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. <b>The</b> <b>conservation</b> work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>conservation</b> was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
