A layered medium field solution using a perturbative approach to account for the reflection on the sea surface is used while reasonable approximations are used to compute the ""channel response"" of the tropospheric medium.

40|$|BIGHORNS is a {{total power}} {{radiometer}} developed to identify the signal from the Epoch of Reionisation in the all-sky averaged radio spectrum at low frequencies (70 - 300 MHz). In October 2014, the system with a conical log spiral antenna was deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) and has been collecting data since then. The system has been monitoring the radio frequency interference (RFI) environment at the future site of the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array. We have analyzed almost two years of data (October 2014 - August 2016 inclusive) in search for events of long distance propagation of the RFI in FM and digital TV bands due to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> and reflections (of the meteor trails or aircraft). We present statistics of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> events observed in the digital TV band over nearly two years, which shows seasonal changes.

5000|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> {{is a type}} {{of radio}} {{propagation}} that tends to happen during periods of stable, anticyclonic weather. In this propagation method, when the signal encounters a rise in temperature in the atmosphere instead of the normal decrease (known as a temperature inversion), the higher refractive index of the atmosphere there will cause the signal to be bent. <b>Tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> affects all frequencies, and signals enhanced this way tend to travel up to 800 mi (though some people have received [...] "tropo" [...] beyond 1,000 miles / 1,600 km), while with tropospheric-bending, stable signals with good signal strength from 500+ miles (800+ km) away are not common when the refractive index of the atmosphere is fairly high.|$|R
50|$|High mountainous {{areas and}} undulating terrain between the {{transmitter}} and receiver can form an effective barrier to tropospheric signals.

50|$|In {{certain parts}} of the world, notably the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> {{conditions}} can become established for many months of the year to the extent that viewers regularly receive quality reception of signals over distances of 1,000 mi. Such conditions are normally optimum during very hot settled summer weather.|$|R
50|$|Adverse weather conditions: During {{periods of}} uniquely {{high-pressure}} weather, VHF signals which would normally exit {{through the atmosphere}} can instead be reflected by the troposphere. This <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> will cause the signal to travel much further than intended; often causing interference to local transmitters in the areas affected by the increased range of the distant transmitter.|$|R
50|$|To {{traverse}} these distances, directional Yagi antennas {{are almost}} essential and are generally horizontally polarized.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) model is developed and used to predict the presence of ducting phenomena for a specific time, taking into account ground values of atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and temperature. A feed forward backpropagation ANN is implemented, which is trained, validated and tested using atmospheric radiosonde data from the Helliniko airport, for the period from 1991 to 2004. The network's quality and generality is assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves (AUC), which resulted to a mean value of about 0. 86 to 0. 90, depending on the observation time. In order to validate the ANN results and to evaluate any further improvement options of the proposed method, the problem was additionally treated using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifiers, trained and tested with identical data sets for direct performance comparison with the ANN. Furthermore, time series prediction {{and the effect of}} surface wind to the presence of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducts</b> appearance are discussed.

50|$|Sporadic E, {{also called}} E-skip, is the {{phenomenon}} of irregularly scattered patches of relatively dense ionization that develop seasonally within the E region of the ionosphere and reflect TV and FM frequencies, generally up to about 150 MHz.

E-skip is unrelated to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> {{of radio}} and {{television}} signals is relatively common {{during the summer and}} autumn months, and is the result of change in the refractive index of the atmosphere at the boundary between air masses of different temperatures and humidities. Using an analogy, {{it can be said that}} the denser air at ground level slows the wave front a little more than does the rare upper air, imparting a downward curve to the wave travel.|$|R
50|$|Very high {{frequency}} radio waves can be refracted by inversions, {{making it possible}} to hear FM radio or watch VHF low-band television broadcasts from long distances on foggy nights. The signal, which would normally be refracted up and away from the ground-based antenna, is instead refracted down towards the earth by the temperature-inversion boundary layer. This phenomenon is called <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting.</b> Along coast lines during Autumn and Spring, due to multiple stations being simultaneously present because of reduced propagation losses, many FM radio stations are plagued by severe signal degradation causing them to sound scrambled.|$|R

50|$|GPB {{has placed}} {{most of its}} {{stations}} on VHF due to the lower effective radiated power requirements (20 or 32 kW instead of 1000 kW), which in turn reduces the cost of purchasing the transmitter and using the electrical power for it. For WABW and WCES, this makes them {{one of the few}} television stations in the country to operate on low-band VHF channels (2 to 6), which require larger receiving antennas, are prone to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> (weather) and impulse noise, make mobile TV (ATSC-M/H) difficult, and for 5 and 6 are also an obstacle to expanding the FM broadcast band. The high-band VHF channels also have these problems, but not to a major extent.|$|R
50|$|Both AM and FM IBOC signals cause {{interference}} to adjacent-channel stations, but {{not within}} the stationâs interference-free protected contours designated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

The range of a station on an HD Radio receiver is somewhat less than its analog signal. However, in June, 2008, a group of US broadcasters and equipment manufacturers requested that the U.S. FCC increase the permissible FM IBOC power from 1% (currently) {{to a maximum of}} 10% of the analog power. On January 29, 2010, the FCC approved the request. In addition, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> and e-skip can reduce the range of the digital signal, as well as the analog.|$|R

Turbulence structure function constant (Cn 2) profiles, measured using co-located VHF and UHF wind-profiling radars, show duct associated enhancement Inconsistencies between the profiles for the two radars are attributed to significant contributions to scattering at the lower frequency due to processes other than classical turbulence.

Ken Santarelli of Surge Media, LLC cited extreme tropospheric interference problems as being the major component of why WSTK was not viable, in which <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> would cause other radio stations, even from several states away, to cause interference in the Morehead City, New Bern, and Washington areas; making WSTK unlistenable for as much as six hours out of the day.

Propagation factor and path loss results calculated for phase-corrected Ament, non-phase-corrected Ament and the other widely used, Miller-Brown, rough surface reflection coefficient are compared and discussed. The main effects from the accounting of the shadowing result in the shift of the interference minima and maxima of the propagation factor, changes in the path loss pattern and destruction of the trapping property of the duct. 1...|$|R
50|$|In 1989, an {{agreement}} was made between WBLM, {{which at the}} time was broadcasting on 107.5 FM, and WTHT to swap frequencies while retaining their respective call letters. At the time of the swap, the 107.5 FM frequency had an ERP of 50,000 watts and was licensed to Lewiston (Auburn). This swap was intended to give WBLM a significantly stronger signal in Portland, as well as Central and Southern Maine, Eastern New Hampshire, and Northeastern Massachusetts; however, once the swap was complete, WTHT lost a significant amount of coverage, especially in extreme Southern Maine and Southeastern New Hampshire. In fact, during the summer <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> season, WTHT often suffered from significant interference from WFCC in Chatham, Massachusetts, also on 107.5 FM. This interference was often so significant that, at times, WTHT's signal was completely replaced by WFCC's signal in Southeastern New Hampshire and along the Maine coast from Kittery to the Biddeford/Saco area.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the digital}} signal fails, the analog signal {{is used as}} a {{fallback}} for the main digital channel (normally HD1), requiring synchronization of the two. Current FCC rules require that one channel be a simulcast of the analog signal. In some cases, particularly during <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> events, an HD Radio receiver will lock on to the digital sidebands of a distant station, even though there is a much stronger local analog-only station on the same frequency. With no automatic identification of the station on the analog signal, there is no way for the receiver to recognize that there is no correlation between the two. (Station identification is sent by voice, or as RBDS data, but not all stations use RBDS.) The listener can possibly turn HD reception off (to listen to the local station, or avoid random flipping between the two stations), or listen to the distant stations and try to get a station ID.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, signal bending in the atmosphere's {{troposphere}} {{known as}} <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> can allow 2-meter signals to carry hundreds or {{even thousands of}} miles {{as evidenced by the}} occasional 2-meter contact between the west coast of the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, the northeast region to the Florida coast and across the Gulf of Mexico. These [...] "Openings" [...] as they are known, are generally first spotted by amateurs operating SSB and CW modes since amateurs using these modes are always alert for ducting or signal enhancement events. Completion of contacts using these weak signal modes involves the exchange of signal level reports and location by grid square which is known as the Maidenhead Locator System. Two way ducting contacts can have very strong signals and are often made with moderate power, small antennas and other types of modes. Long distance ducting contacts do occur using FM modes as well {{but for the most part}} go unnoticed by many FM operators.|$|R

[...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducting,</b> can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|R
40|$|Propagation of radar signals {{through the}} {{atmosphere}} {{is strongly dependent on}} local meteorological conditions, especially in the atmospheric boundary layer. A rapid change in air temperature and humidity with height leads to the generation of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ducts.</b> Electromagnetic energy can propagate over large distances within a duct and can cause interference on terrestrial and satellite communication links. Duct detection is therefore desirable to predict such interference and influence on radar coverage. Anomalous variations in radiosonde measured temperature and humidity gradient, yield negative values of modified refractive index, M, gradient profiles. These profiles are indicators of ducting conditions in the lower troposphere. However, radiosonde measurements are sparsely distributed in time. Autonomous systems such as wind profiler radars, which operate continuously 24 hours a day could provide continuous monitoring of duct occurrence with height. The 915 MHz wind profiler (operated by the UK Meteorological Office at Camborne) and radiosonde data from Camborne were analysed for the month of June 2000. The data analyses showed that the wind profiler is able to detect ducting conditions through (i) strong correlation of increase in the turbulence structure function parameter, C/sub n//sup 2 /, with negative values of dM/dz and (ii) agreement in increase in potential refractive index (estimated from radar data) with increase in potential refractive index obtained from radiosonde data, within the duct region...|$|R
