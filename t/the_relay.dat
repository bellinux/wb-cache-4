Jamaica was subsequently stripped of their gold medal due to doping charges and Trinidad and Tobago was awarded the gold. The Japanese team (38.15seconds) earned the bronze medal -- later promoted to silver -- in the event, placing immediately behind Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of <b>the</b> <b>relay.</b> After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. <b>The</b> <b>relay</b> room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E

In this work, a limited feedback channel is considered between <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> and <b>the</b> destination. The destination finds the optimal rotation vector and feeds it back to <b>the</b> <b>relays.</b> We propose an iterative algorithm to find this optimal rotation vector. The proposed algorithm is shown to have optimal performance with low complexity. I...|$|R
30|$|In Figure 2 b, LS = 2 is considered. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>relayed</b> {{transmission}} with LS = 2 and LR = 1 only outperforms {{the direct}} transmission for 0.3 <d≤ 0.7. The reason is that, {{while in the}} direct transmission both STC columns enjoy the beamforming gain (from the BS), in <b>the</b> <b>relayed</b> setup {{only one of the}} two STC columns does. For d≥ 0.75, it is again observed that the effect of decoding errors worsens the performance of <b>the</b> <b>relayed</b> transmissions. Finally, <b>the</b> scheme with LS = 2 and LR = 2 achieves the best performance but, again, the beamforming gain at <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> is useless for d≥ 0.6. Therefore, the additional complexity to carry out beamforming is not worth at all in setups where <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> are closer to the destination than to the BS.|$|R
