Data for this study consists of aircraft data averaged over one minute supplimented by satellite and drifting buoy observations.

Results show a PBL which differs from that found in typical cyclones, with large latent heat fluxes south of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and with relatively weak sensible heat fluxes about <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front. Boundary layer stratification was stable north of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and unstable south of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front.

40|$|AbstractProjections of {{equatorial}} {{sea surface}} temperature from CMIP 5 climate models {{are important for}} understanding possible future changes in marine habitats, local rainfall and climate processes such as El Niño Southern Oscillation. Interpreting the projected changes in the tropical Pacific {{is complicated by the}} systematic cold tongue bias and overly westward location of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool edge at the equator in coupled models. Here an index based on the maximum zonal salinity gradient is used to differentiate <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool from <b>the</b> cold tongue in each of 19 CMIP 5 models. Warming is then calculated relative to the dynamic edge of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool between <b>the</b> second halves of the 20 th and 21 st Centuries from the RCP 8. 5 scenario to provide a bias adjusted SST projection. Based on this definition of the edge, while <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool edge is projected to warm, it is likely to remain within 10 ° of its present longitude. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} large projected eastward displacements of the isotherms that are usually used to define the edge. Adjusting for <b>the</b> edge, <b>warming</b> within <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool is projected to be fairly uniform with surface water freshening. Projected warming is enhanced over the cold tongue with the net effect of reducing the zonal SST gradient. In contrast, if <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is calculated without correcting for the edge of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool, <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> signature is dominated by the poorer performing models with an overly westward Warm Pool, resulting in enhanced <b>warming</b> across <b>the</b> equatorial Pacific. Bias adjusting realigns <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> signature and reduces the model spread of projected <b>warming.</b> <b>The</b> biased <b>warming</b> signature also introduces spurious meridional and zonal SST gradients. This will potentially alter the behaviour of the atmospheric convergence zones and the dynamics of ENSO which is influenced by the extent of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool and zonal SST gradients...|$|R

5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>warmer</b> spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

A hindcast experiment qualitatively reproduces <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> and decadal　fluctuations of the intermediate water {{that are similar to}} those of observations: <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is significant along the western part of the Okhotsk Sea and subarctic frontal region. The effects of the thermohaline- and　wind-driven ocean circulation on <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> are evaluated from perturbation experiments on thermohaline (turbulent heat and freshwater fluxes) and wind causes, respectively. The thermohaline causes are shown to contribute positively to <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW). The heat budget analysis for the OSIW indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to a decrease in cold and dense shelf water (DSW) flux, which is caused by a decrease in sea ice and surface water freshening. In contrast, the wind cause has a cooling effect in the OSIW through an increase in DSW. In the subarctic frontal region, <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is mainly caused by the wind stress change. The heat budget analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to an increase in the northward advection of <b>the</b> subtropical <b>warm</b> water. These results imply that both thermohaline- and winddriven ocean circulation changes are essential components of <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> intermediate water.
