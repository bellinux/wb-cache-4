5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> a silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; and Leave It to Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the promenade, {{in order}} to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since {{received a letter from}} the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

Trade speculation {{of its power}} output ranged from 5 to 15 watts per channel. Naim confirmed years later that the NAIT is rated at 13 watts.

[...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1972, Vulović {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} resume {{working as a}} flight attendant. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights.

500|$|Booker {{generated}} controversy on May 12, 2012, when {{he appeared}} on Meet The Press as a surrogate for the reelection campaign of Barack Obama and made remarks that were critical of that campaign. Booker said that the attacks on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital were [...] "nauseating <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> both sides. It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright." [...] The comments were subsequently used by the Romney campaign against Obama. Booker made follow-up comments clarifying that he believed Obama's attacks on Romney's record at Bain were legitimate but did not retract his point about attacking private equity in general. Two weeks later, Booker's communications director Anne Torres tendered her resignation, although she maintained it was unrelated to Meet the Press.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, who is Jewish, {{and whose}} father is Jewish {{while his mother}} is Catholic, has become a {{prominent}} figure in the Jewish community, and enjoys the attention that he attracts from it. He was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, licensed by Major League Baseball, commemorating the Jewish major leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among others, teammate Scott Feldman, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis. Kinsler {{was one of three}} Jewish players in the 2008 All Star Game, joining Youkilis and Braun. He says that [...] "Youkilis will always say something <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the bases [...] 'Happy Passover,' he'll throw something at me." [...] In July 2013 he passed Shawn Green with his 163rd steal, to become the all-time career steals leader among Jewish major leaguers.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{has been}} {{embraced by the}} LGBT {{community}} as an anthem. On October 5, 2010, several hundred people gathered {{in front of the}} Massachusetts State House and sang [...] "Beautiful" [...] as a tribute to the teenagers who had committed suicide due to anti-gay bullying during the previous months. In March 2011, the Columbus Children's Choir and Columbus Gay Men's Chorus joined to perform the song as a contribution to the It Gets Better Project. UK LGBT rights charity Stonewall named [...] "Beautiful" [...] the most empowering song of the decade for lesbian, gay and bisexual people; media personality and Stonewall contributor Paul Gambaccini called the song [...] "a major achievement that has inspired millions of young people around the world." [...] The result is based on the choice from 1,007 readers. Aguilera commented of the song's reception, [...] "I cannot express in words how much the LGBT community means <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>On</b> my darkest day their support lifts me up. I feel honored that some of my songs become anthems to them as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He {{lived in a small}} apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
