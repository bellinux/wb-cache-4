The study involved 8 tasks, grouped into 3 themes of analysis: 1) the targeting of EU- 27 rural development expenditure, 2000 - 13, including the development of databases of EU- 27 rural area characteristics and ‘indicators of need’ for RD; 2) consideration of the adequacy of the current EAFRD framework, based upon an evaluation of instruments’ cost-effectiveness; the a priori development of a typology of RD interventions and catalogue of instruments; an analysis of delivery mechanisms; and assessment of instruments in ‘fiches’; 3) conclusions and recommendations. In the event, progress in finalising national and/or regional RDPs 2007 - 13 was delayed,over the study period. Thus, the approach was modified to incorporate more qualitative analysis and the expenditure analysis was made using incomplete figures (July 2007), so 4 % of <b>total</b> <b>EAFRD</b> planned expenditure was missing. ...|$|E
