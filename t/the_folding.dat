5|$|Folding screen: <b>The</b> <b>folding</b> {{screen is}} a type of {{furniture}} consisting of several frames or panels. Screens date back to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty period (771–256 BC). These were initially one-panel screens in contrast to folding screens. Folding screens were invented during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 220). Depictions of those folding screens have been found in Han Dynasty era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province. During the Tang Dynasty, folding screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on.

40|$|International audienceA recent {{method for}} {{modeling}} folds uses a fold frame with coordinates {{based on the}} structural geology of folds: fold axis direction, fold axial surface and extension direction. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be characterised by rotating <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame by <b>the</b> pitch of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> axis in <b>the</b> axial surface and the angle between <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> foliation and <b>the</b> axial surface. These rotation angles can be expressed as 1 D functions of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame coordinates. In this contribution we present methods for extracting and automatically modeling <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometries from structural data. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles used for characterising <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be calculated locally from structural observations. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles incorporate the structural geology of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> and allow for individual structural measurements to be viewed {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> structure. To filter out the effects of later <b>folding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles are plotted against the coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame. Using these plots the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> can be interpolated directly from structural data where we use a combination of radial basis function and harmonic analysis to interpolate and extrapolate <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry. This contribution addresses a major limitation in existing methods where <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry was not constrained from structural data.

5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process.|$|E

40|$|Fold uplifts compete {{during their}} {{development}} with regional subsidence in the frontal parts of thrust belts and accretionary wedges. Two cases exist in frontal thrust belts. In the first, more common case, the uplift rate of <b>the</b> external <b>folds</b> {{is higher than}} the subsidence rate of the foredeep. In the second case <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift is less than the regional subsidence. <b>The</b> total <b>fold</b> uplift may be considered as <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift rate minus the regional subsidence rate; this value can be either positive or negative. Positive total fold uplift occurs when folds rise faster than regional subsidence and the envelope of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest rises towards the hinterland of the accretionary wedge. In the opposite case, negative total <b>fold</b> uplift, <b>the</b> envelope dips towards <b>the</b> hinterland because <b>folds</b> rise more slowly than regional subsidence. In the first positive case, <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> are deeply eroded and the onlap of the growing strata moves away from <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest if <b>the</b> sedimentation rate is lower than <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift rate in marine or alluvial environments.

This second tectonic setting is commonly associated with accretionary wedges forming along west-directed subduction zones, which are characterized by high subsidence rates in the foredeep or trench, due to the fast 'eastward' roll-back of the subduction hinge (e. g.

5|$|Commandant Teste was {{designed}} to accommodate the naval version of the Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were obsolete when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July–August 1934. The Latécoère 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March–May 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933.

5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

Imagine the following situation: {{at an early stage}} of <b>folding</b> and near <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> tip, river flows approximately along <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crests towards <b>the</b> end of a fold as river tends to flow down the slope of maximum gradient.

As the point is uplifted to a higher elevation, the slope of maximum gradient is no longer along <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest, but becomes <b>the</b> distance from <b>fold</b> hinge towards <b>the</b> other end of fold limb, which is approximately perpendicular to the original orientation. As a result, the new generation of river flows perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest along <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> limbs. Because of strong river erosion in the upper course, some of the drainage channels of the earlier stage are deeply incised into bedrock and therefore river continues to flow along these upper parts of old channels that do not follow the maximum slope gradient. As a result, combining the fold-crest-parallel direction of flow in the upper part of drainage channels (which are inherited from the early stages of deformation) and the fold-crest-perpendicular direction of flow in the middle and lower of drainage channels, an asymmetric drainage pattern that resembles a bent fork results.
