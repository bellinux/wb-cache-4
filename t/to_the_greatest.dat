5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E

5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be less than or equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be {{less than or equal to}} r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 1,358 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since 1856 to 1,355 men. There are several {{statistics}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number of VCs awarded in individual battles or wars. The {{greatest number of}} Victoria Crosses won on a single day is 24, for deeds performed on 16 November 1857 in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. The greatest number won by a single unit during a single action is seven, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke's Drift, 22–23 January 1879, during the Zulu War. The greatest number won in a single conflict is 628, being for the First World War. There are only six living holders of the VC—four British, one Australian, one Gurkha—one award for the Second World War and four awards since; in addition one New Zealander holds the Victoria Cross for New Zealand and four Australians hold the Victoria Cross for Australia. Eight of the then-twelve surviving holders of the Victoria Cross attended the 150th Anniversary service of remembrance at Westminster Abbey on 26 June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} met with mixed reviews from music critics. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News {{compared}} Ones <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> hit collections of musicians such as Buddy Holly, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. Jon O'Brien of AllMusic wrote that Ones ignores Selena's self-titled EMI debut album, focusing on her career between 1990 and 1995. Ones was nominated for Latin Greatest Hits Album of the Year at the 2003 Billboard Latin Music Awards. It debuted (and peaked) at number four on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart, achieving a Hot Shot Debut on 19 October 2002. The album debuted at number 162 on the Billboard 200 chart. It peaked two weeks later at number 159 the week of 9 November 2002. Ones was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in February 2003, signifying 100,000 units shipped in the United States. The recording became the 13th Top Latin Album of 2002 and the ninth Top Latin Pop Album of that year, ranking number 88 on the Top Latin Album of the 2000s chart.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> number of new varieties and species.
