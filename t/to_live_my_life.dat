The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

40|$|The study {{described}} in this article explored how 7 men who believed they were dying from an AIDS-related illness began the process of rebuilding their lives following a course of success-ful combination therapy. Using constant comparison within and across interviews, three major themes emerged. Back to living was the realization they were going <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> Realizing <b>my</b> <b>life</b> has changed was associated with living with uncertainty, appearing healthy while living with AIDS, and letting go of their preoccupation with physical well-being. Re-adusting <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was associated with a change in daily routines, reevaluation of their sense of self, questioning their relationships, reengaging with society, and developing new life plans. Findings suggest that these participants felt living had become more difficult. In the past, living with AIDS caused people to give up hope for recovery (Cow-ard, 1994; Coward & Lewis, 1993). In 1996, changes appeared, providing people living with HIV (PLWHIV) with hope for recovery. First, viral load testing allowed for the accurate monitoring of disease progression by measuring the HIV concen-tration in the plasma (Melroe, Stawarz, Simpsons, & Henry, 1997). Second, the intro-duction of protease inhibitors, when used in combination with other antiretrovirals, inhibited viral replication during different stages in the replication process (Berger, 1996; Phillips, 1996). The changes in drug protocols strongly indicated a slowing in the decline of T-helper lymphocytes (CD 4), decreases in viral loads, and lower mor-tality rates (Bartlett, 1998; Carpenter et al., 1996; Gazzard, 1996). Little has been documented {{about the impact of the}} new treatments for PLWHIV. The Lazarus syndrome, where people question how long the positive effect will last and how long the medications must be taken (Gregonis, 1997), is a key issue for those taking combination therapy. Anderson and Weatherburn (1998) and Sowell, Phillips, and Grier (1998) found that uncertainty regarding the efficacy of combination therapy played a critical role in the lives of PLWHIV. The participants in these studies expressed a sense of renewed hope mixed with a feeling of uncer-tainty. They viewed reinvesting in their futures as a risky venture because the...|$|R
