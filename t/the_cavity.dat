5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze water out of <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
50|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{divides the}} thoracic and <b>the</b> abdominal <b>cavities.</b> <b>The</b> abdominal <b>cavity</b> occupies <b>the</b> entire {{lower half of}} the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under <b>the</b> abdominal <b>cavity,</b> anterior to <b>the</b> buttocks, is <b>the</b> pelvic <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> pelvic <b>cavity</b> is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to <b>the</b> abdominal <b>cavity.</b> Together <b>the</b> abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as <b>the</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity</b> while <b>the</b> thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity.Subdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) CavitiesThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: <b>the</b> thoracic <b>cavity</b> and <b>the</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> thoracic <b>cavity</b> is <b>the</b> more superior subdivision of <b>the</b> anterior <b>cavity,</b> and it is enclosed by the rib cage. <b>The</b> thoracic <b>cavity</b> contains <b>the</b> lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of <b>the</b> thoracic <b>cavity</b> and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity</b> is <b>the</b> largest <b>cavity</b> in <b>the</b> body. Although no membrane physically divides <b>the</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity,</b> it can be useful to distinguish between <b>the</b> abdominal <b>cavity,</b> <b>the</b> division that houses the digestive organs, and <b>the</b> pelvic <b>cavity,</b> <b>the</b> division that houses the organs of reproduction.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> ventral body <b>cavity</b> is a {{human body}} cavity {{that is in the}} {{anterior}} (front) aspect of the human body. It is made up of <b>the</b> thoracic <b>cavity,</b> and <b>the</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity</b> is further divided into <b>the</b> abdominal <b>cavity</b> and pelvic cavity, but there is no physical barrier between the two. <b>The</b> abdominal <b>cavity</b> contains digestive organs, <b>the</b> pelvic <b>cavity</b> contains <b>the</b> urinary bladder, internal reproductive organs, and rectum.|$|R
5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E
5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be inserted into <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> while the mould is open, allowing the material injected {{in the next}} cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} currents flowing around <b>the</b> <b>cavities,</b> {{and their}} effect on the electron flow within the tube, causes large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in <b>the</b> <b>cavities.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cavities</b> are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single, larger, microwave oscillator. A [...] "tap", normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy from one of <b>the</b> <b>cavities.</b> In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a waveguide.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{thoracic}} <b>cavity</b> {{is separated}} from <b>the</b> abdominopelvic <b>cavity</b> by <b>the</b> diaphragm. <b>The</b> thoracic <b>cavity</b> is further separated into <b>the</b> pleural <b>cavity</b> which contains <b>the</b> lungs and the superior mediastinum which includes <b>the</b> pericardial (heart) <b>cavity.</b>|$|R
30|$|During conditioning, {{a greater}} amount of solvent evaporates from <b>the</b> cell <b>cavities</b> than from <b>the</b> cell walls, which {{increases}} the concentration of solute in <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> compared to <b>the</b> walls.

5|$|The Chicago Park District, University of Chicago, and Art Institute of Chicago conservators all {{sponsored}} restoration work, including {{drying out}} <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> of the hollow sculpture, {{removal of the}} deteriorated substructure, a newly designed ventilation system within the piece, a protective exterior coating, and repairs to the reflecting pool. In 1989 Chicago Park District allocated $150,000 to the repair project, which amount was matched by the Ferguson fund. By the end of 1991, the Park District had collected $320,000 of the $520,000 estimated repair costs from public and private funds, although in 1994 the sculpture still awaited repair.|$|E
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and <b>the</b> <b>cavity,</b> while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> magnetron in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a television receiver, was used as the basis of the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other radar systems throughout the war.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multipartite system {{consisting of two}} noninteracting qubits each embedded in a single-mode leaky cavity, in turn connected to an external bosonic reservoir. Initially, we take the two qubits in an entangled state while <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> and <b>the</b> reservoirs have zero photons. We investigate, in this six-partite quantum system, the transfer of quantum discord from the qubits to <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> and reservoirs. We show that this transfer also occurs when <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> are not entangled. Moreover, we discuss how quantum discord can be extracted from <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> and transferred to distant systems by traveling leaking photons, using the input–output theory...|$|R

5|$|The body {{is divided}} into coeloms, {{compartments}} lined with mesothelium. The main body cavity, {{under the crown of}} tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom. Above the mouth is the epistome, a hollow lid which can close the mouth. <b>The</b> <b>cavity</b> in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors disagree that it is a coelom and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes think it is built by a different process.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On each side of <b>the</b> <b>cavity,</b> a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines {{the inside of the}} chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> is too small.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Agatha {{was first}} {{identified}} as a trough of low pressure of the western coast of Costa Rica on May24, 2010.

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside <b>the</b> <b>cavity</b> were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered.

The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
