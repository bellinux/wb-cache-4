Saskatchewan is committed to protecting species at risk in Canada. The growing season has been studied and classified into plant hardiness zones depending on length of growing season and climatic conditions. Biogeographic factors have also been divided into ecoregions and floristic kingdoms across Saskatchewan, and natural vegetation varies depending on elevation, moisture, soil and weather.

25|$|Having {{discovered}} his sexual inclination early in life, Negoiţescu {{claimed to have}} had his first sexual experiences while still a young boy. According to his own testimony, he made his coming out at around age sixteen, when he wrote about his homosexuality in a test paper which he then handed to his supervising teacher. Reportedly, the paper was graded a ten out of ten, without further commentary from its recipient. Negoiţescu later openly assumed his sexual identity and, in contrast to other gay men of 20th century Romania, did not deny {{it in front of}} the conservative cultural establishment (see LGBT rights in Romania). At the time however, <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> in which the adolescent Negoiţescu disregarded social conventions caused a rift between him and his parents, resulting in the first of his several suicide attempts. Negoiţescu's subsequent life was marked by successive bouts of clinical depression and self-hatred.|$|E
25|$|There {{is no one}} {{treatment}} {{proven to}} be effective {{for all types of}} aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is {{because of the nature of}} the disorder and <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment in general has positive outcomes. Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends. Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions. It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.|$|E
25|$|To provide clarity, cross-linguistic {{influence}} can {{be understood}} as <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons linguistic performance or development. Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E

25|$|A {{calculation}} of the MPE for ocular exposure takes into account <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, {{which means that the}} MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated laser beams of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of spatial coherence than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated laser beams. In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the eye lens focuses the light into the smallest possible spot size on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, {{it is based on the}} power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for laser beams that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSIZ136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.|$|E

500|$|Final Destination 3 was {{released}} on DVD on July 25, 2006, in widescreen and fullscreen. Special features include audio commentary, a deleted scene, three documentaries, the theatrical trailer and an original animated video. Audio commentary is by Wong, Morgan and cinematographer Robert Mclachlan. The deleted scene is an extended version of Wendy and Kevin's discussion after they are questioned by the police. The first documentary, Dead Teenager Movie, examines the history of slasher films. The second, Kill Shot: Making Final Destination 3, focuses on {{the making of the}} film and includes interviews with the cast and crew. The third documentary, Severed Piece, discusses the film's special effects, pyrotechnics and gore effects. A seven-minute cartoon, It's All Around You, explains <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> people can die. Special DVD editions labelled [...] "Thrill Ride Edition" [...] also include an optional [...] "Choose Their Fate" [...] feature, allowing viewers to make decisions at several points in the film. Most provide only a minor alternate scene, but the first choice allows the viewer to stop the four characters from getting on the roller coaster before the premonition, thus ending the film immediately. Final Destination 3 {{was released}} digitally on streaming platforms Amazon Video, Google Play and Netflix.|$|E

Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be about kids {{who are looking for}} approval and <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways</b> they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages.
