40|$|The {{effect of}} anti-mu and {{anti-delta}} on the primary in vitro IgM response of murine splenocytes to thymus-dependent (trinitrophenylated erythrocytes) and thymus-independent (trinitrophenylated brucella) forms of trinitrophenyl was studied. The {{results indicate that}} either anti-mu or anti-delta can block the response of adult splenocytes to the <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen.</b> The thymus-dependent responses of neonatal splenocytes that bear a low concentration of IgD were also abrogated by treatment with anti-delta. In contrast, anti-mu, but not anti-delta, blocked the response of adult splenocytes to the thymus-independent antigen used. These results indicate that both IgM and IgD are receptors required for triggering cells by a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> but that only IgM receptors are required for triggering by the thymus-independent antigen used...|$|E

40|$|B-cell {{tolerance}} {{has been}} induced by oligovalent <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> {{in an entirely}} in vitro system. Dissociated spleen cells from congenitally athymic (nu/nu) mice were preincubated for 24 h with 0. 1 [...] 1 mg/ml of either fowl gamma globulin (FGG) of DNP-human gamma globulin (DNP-HGG). After washing, the cells were {{tested for the ability}} to mount in vitro, thymus-independent responses against FGG and DNP. A state of specific responsiveness to either FGG or DNP was thus demonstrated. Features of this wholly in vitro system that paralleled previous findings on the in vivo induction of B-cell tolerance in nu/nu mice were the kinetics, 24 h being required for tolerance induction in either case, the abrogation of tolerance induction by the presence of POL both in vivo and in vitro, and finally the observation that in neither case was there a requirement for the antigens to be deaggregated. It was shown that DNP-(Fab) 2 fragments prepared from HGG induced DNP-specific tolerance indicating that the Fc piece was not required for tolerance induction in this in vitro system. DNP-bovine serum albumin was less effective than DNP-HGG or DNP-(Fab) 2. Preincubation with subtoxic concentrations of DNP-lysine of DNP-epsilon- capric acid had only a marginal effect on DNP responsiveness. Since nu/nu mice, lacking in detectable T-cell function, were used as spleen cell donors, this work provides further evidence that B-cell tolerance to <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> can be induced without the participation of T cells. It is suggested that B-cell tolerance to <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> occurs when the antigen in a sufficient concentration and over a sufficient period of time has direct access to the B cell. This contact with antigen must be {{in the absence of an}} additional influence provided either by adjuvants like endotoxin or POL, or by activated macrophages, which may be stimulated by activated T cells; otherwise not tolerance but B-cell activation will occur...|$|R

40|$|Although {{recent work}} has {{suggested}} that different mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} state of specific immunological unresponsiveness that can be induced by either thymusdependent or thymus-independent antigens (1, 2), {{it has been shown that}} B-cell tolerance to a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> can be induced in the absence offunctional T cells both in vivo and in vitro (1, 3). Thus, while a complete antibody response to a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> such as fowl gamma globulin (FGG) ' requires the presence of specific T cells (4), there is no obligatory requirement for T cells in the interaction that leads to B-cell tolerance. In fact there is suggestive evidence that activated T cells may counteract the tolerogenic process, since B-cell tolerance induction occurs readily in instances where T-cell activation does not occur because haptens have been presented on nonimmunogenic synthetic copolymers (5), or on autologous proteins (6 - 8) or erythrocytes (9). Additionally, the physical state of aggregation of the antigen does not seem critical for tolerance induction by thymus-dependent antigens in the congenitally athymic mouse (1, 3), suggesting that the reason that aggregates often prevent tolerance induction in euthymic mice (10, 11) involves the T cell...|$|E

40|$|Specific {{suppressor}} {{cells have}} been demonstrated in mice tolerant to the <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> HGG. Transfer of normal thymocytes, normal spleen cells, or immune spleen cells into these tolerant mice did not restore immunocompetence to HGG. Furthermore, the transfer of tolerant spleen cells into normal recipients abrogated the response of these recipients to subsequent challenge with immunogenic HGG. Spleen cells removed from mice 5, 8, or 11 wk after the induction of tolerance specifically suppressed the response of normal spleen cells in an adoptive cell transfer system. The extent of suppression appears to be dependent upon how long after the induction of tolerance the cells {{were removed from the}} tolerant donors and how soon after transfer the recipients were challenged...|$|E

40|$|Specific {{immunological}} unresponsiveness was induced using <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> in congenitally athymic (nu/nu) mice, {{in which}} no T-cell function has been demonstrated. The tolerance was induced in vivo by the injection of 5 – 10 mg of either FGG or DNP-HGG. Spleen cells from treated mice were tested in vitro for the ability to mount thymus-independent immune responses against FGG {{in the presence of}} polymerized flagellin POL, and the DNP determinant conjugated to POL. A specific deficiency in either the in vitro anti-FGG or anti-DNP response was demonstrated, depending on the antigen used for treatment of the spleen cell donor. Athymic mice treated with FGG were also tested by in vivo challenge with FGG given with POL as an adjuvant and were found to be hyporesponsive. Unresponsiveness to in vitro challenge was established by 24 h after the in vivo injection of FGG. It was found that the injection of POL with the FGG prevented the development of unresponsiveness, but not if the POL was given 24 h or more after the FGG. The unresponsiveness could not be overcome by confrontation with allogeneic spleen cells from CBA mice, although the presence of allogeneic spleen cells had a large amplifying effect on the response of control spleen cells.

40|$|There is much evidence, based {{primarily}} on in vitro studies, indicating that the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) mimics an activated CD 40 receptor. In order to investigate the extent of similarity between LMP 1 and CD 40 functions in vivo, we analyzed the cytoplasmic signaling properties of LMP 1 and CD 40 in B cells in a directly comparable manner. For this purpose, we generated transgenic mice expressing either LMP 1 or a chimeric LMP 1 CD 40 molecule, which constitutively activates the CD 40 pathway, {{under the control of}} the CD 19 promoter. LMP 1 and LMP 1 CD 40 were expressed at similar levels in a B-lymphocyte-specific manner. Similar to LMP 1, LMP 1 CD 40 suppressed germinal center (GC) formation and antibody production in response to <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens,</b> albeit to a greater extent than LMP 1. Furthermore, the avidity of the antibodies produced against <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> was lower for LMP 1 CD 40 transgenic mice than for wild-type and LMP 1 transgenic mice. GC suppression was linked to the ability of LMP 1 CD 40 and LMP 1 to downregulate mRNA and protein levels of BCL 6 and to suppress the activity of the BCL 6 promoter. In contrast to LMP 1, LMP 1 CD 40 caused an upregulation of CD 69, CD 80, and CD 86 in B cells and a dramatic increase in serum immunoglobulin M. In addition, LMP 1 CD 40 but not LMP 1 transgenic mice had elevated numbers of marginal-zone B cells and increased populations of polymorphonuclear cells and/or neutrophils. Consistent with these findings, LMP 1 CD 40 but not LMP 1 transgenic mice showed signs of spontaneous inflammatory reactions and the potential for autoimmunity...|$|R

Octasaccharide (OS) derived from K 11 PS by bacteriophage phi 11 -associated glycanase, was coupled to bovine serum albumin and to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The immunogenicity of various antigens after intraperitoneal immunization was studied by measuring the levels of circulating antibodies. Injection of BALB/c mice with K 11 PS resulted in induction of 2 -mercaptoethanol-sensitive immunoglobulin M antibodies. The responses observed in BALB/c nu/nu mice and in male (CBA/N X C 3 H/HeN) F 1 mice indicate that K 11 PS is a thymus-independent type 2 antigen. Immunization of BALB/c mice with either OS-bovine serum albumin or OS-keyhole limpet hemocyanin resulted in the induction of circulating 2 -mercaptoethanol-resistant immunoglobulin G antibodies.

40|$|Peritoneal exudate {{cells from}} nu/nu mice stimulated with proteose peptone broth, {{but in general}} not from unstimulated mice, {{permitted}} cultures of spleen cells from congenitally athymic (nu/nu) mice {{to respond to the}} <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> fowl gamma globulin (FγG). Supernatants of cultures of peritoneal cells were also effective, the activity being sensitive to trypsin. Since nu/nu mice were effective sources of the peritoneal cells it would not seem obligatory for the thymus-derived (T) cell {{to be involved in the}} triggering of the bone marrow-derived (B) cell by a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> FγG. It is proposed that the B cell is triggered at the macrophage surface where it encounters two signals (a) the antigen and (b) a protein secreted by the activated macrophage. In vivo the T cell may have a role in B-cell triggering, either in activating the macrophage or in aiding in presentation of antigen on the macrophage surface. Thymus-independent antigens are proposed to induce an IgM response because they are able to provide "signal two" either by direct interaction with the B cell or via irritation or activation of the macrophage. The stimulatory effect of T cells activated by an allogeneic interaction was used as a model of one influence of the T cell on the development of an antibody response. The presence in cultures of nu/nu spleen of an allogeneic interaction had no effect on the inability of these cells to respond to FγG. However when a source of the postulated second signal such as the supernatant of a macrophage culture was present, an allogeneic interaction had a powerful amplifying effect on the anti-FγG response. In contrast the response of nu/nu spleen cultures to heterologous erythrocytes was greatly enhanced by the presence of an allogeneic interaction. It is suggested that since there was a definite basal response to the heterologous erythrocytes added alone, the enhancement represented not an activation of more B cells but rather an amplification of this basal response. Thus the anti-FγG response in cultures of nu/nu spleen differentiates between factors such as those released by activated macrophages that are involved in B-cell triggering and factors released by activated T cells that amplify the numbers of antibody-forming cells resulting from a B cell already triggered...|$|E

Tests of such cell surface markers as Fc receptors for IgG and IgM, as well as functional assays of antibody production by B cells, revealed that the SBA-agglutinated cell fraction contains the antibody helper T cells whereas the unagglutinated fraction is enriched with antibody suppressor T cells.

These mice exhibited no gross developmental deficiencies or health abnormalities and contained normal percentages of B and T cell subpopulations. CD 40 L-deficient mice did display selective deficiencies in humoral immunity; basal serum isotype levels were significantly lower than observed in normal mice, and IgE was undetectable.

The establishment of thymus-derived (T) and bone marrow-derived (B) cell cooperative interactions in humoral immune responses has necessitated reassessment of conceptual and experimental approaches to the study of tolerance (reviewed in 2).

40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper (1) {{we examined the}} ability of cells bearing IgM, IgD, and IgG to restore the adoptive secondary response of irradiated hosts to a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen,</b> dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) 2 In the present report, we examined the ability of IgM-, IgD-, and IgG-bearing cells from the spleens of unprimed mice to restore the adoptive primary response to DNP-BSA. Studies of the adoptive primary antibody response of rats to horse spleen ferritin have shown that IgM-bearing cells in the spleens of unprimed donors are able to restore beth the IgM and IgG antibody response (2). The role of IgD- and IgG-bearing cells was not examined in the latter work. Recent studies in mice suggest that IgM- but not IgG-bearing cells from the spleens of unprimed animals restore the adoptive direct plaque-forming response of irradiated hosts to the trinitrophenyl hapten. 2 However, the role of IgD-bearing cells in the adoptive direct or indirect plaque-forming response was not examined. The experiments reported herein differ from those described above, in {{that the role of}} cells bearing all three major surface immunoglobulin isotypes in both th...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{sensitive}} and quantitative radioimmunoassay has enabled much finer dissection of the immunoglobulin-antibody profiles for an individual immune response. The kinetics of the response are considered {{in relation to the}} switch from IgM to IgG antibody production. In the domestic fowl, the kinetics of this switch varied with different antigens: whereas the response to a <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> proceeded through a brief 19 S response to a declining 7 S response, the response to a thymus-independent antigen failed to switch from 19 S to 7 S for several weeks and consisted of repeated excursions of 19 S antibodies. When injected intravenously and simultaneously, Salmonella adelaide O (killed) organisms (thymus-independent) and sheep red cells (thymus-dependent) interact so that the response to the latter fails to switch from 19 S to 7 S and consists of repeated excursions of 19 S antibody. The changed character of the sheep red cell response is interpreted as being due to lack of 7 S antibody. Passive antibody to either sheep red cells or to S. adelaide produced an inhibition of the sheep red rell response so that only one excursion of 19 S antibody was observed...|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of B lymphocyte functional heterogeneity {{has been greatly}} advanced by studies with the X-linked immunodeficient (xid) CBA/N mouse (1). CBA/N mice {{do not respond to}} a set of thymus-independent (TI) antigens that includes trinitrophenyl (TNP) -Ficoll and TNP-dextran (2, 3), but retain the ability to respond to other TI antigens such as TNP-Brucella abortus (TNP-BA) and TNPbutanol-extracted lipopolysaccharide [TNP-LPS (Bu) ] (4, 5). The latter group are termed TI- 1 antigens and the former, TI- 2 antigens, {{on the basis of this}} response pattern. Furthermore, mitogenic responses of CBA/N B lymphocytes to LPS, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I-C), and purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) are absent or considerably below the levels of normal controls (6). In addition, the ability of these mice to respond to the <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> sheep erythroeytes (SRBC) and TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin is impaired (7). This deficiency is most profound under limiting in vitro culture conditions where no primary response is generated against TD antigen regardless of the dose used. The low cell numbers, increased surface immunoglobulin (sIg) M (8), and lack o...|$|R
40|$|Summary Clofibrate (CPIB) {{is a drug}} applied as an antilipidaemic {{agent in}} mammals. In this work we have tested its {{efficacy}} in vivo on the growth kinetics of P 1798 (sc) lymphoma transplanted to recipient (BALB/c x AKR) F 1 mice. Our results show a facilitation of the tumour growth rate in treated recipients. This fact {{may be related to}} an effect of the agent on the recipient which produces a decrease in the immune response as was confirmed on testing CPIB on <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens</b> in haemolytic plaque assays. Immune responses to experimental tumours can either facilitate their growth or cause their eradication from the host. Furthermore, several reports have indicated that the resistance of tumour cells to humoral immune attack is directly correlated with their ability to synthesize complex lipids as measured by the incorporation of fatty acids into extractable lipid macromolecules (Schlager & Ohanian, 1977). Some of these cells can be rendered susceptible to immune attack by treatment with certain metabolic inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} immune responses to <b>thymus-dependent</b> and -independent <b>antigens</b> were evaluated in normal male and female mice and in castrated male mice. Both IgM antibody production in the primary response and IgG antibody production in the secondary response were enhanced in females vs. males of equivalent age. Castration of the male converted this animal to a female in terms of responsiveness to the <b>thymus-dependent</b> group of <b>antigens,</b> while inducing equivalent or even greater enhanced responsiveness over the female to the thymus-independent antigen, polyvinylpyrrolidone. Further characteristics {{of the changes in}} lymphoid organs were determined in the castrated animal vs. normal males and females. It was shown that the spleen and thymus became markedly hyperplastic, the organ weights exceeding the female, which in turn were greater than in the male. The enhanced weight of the thymus was shown to be due to increased numbers of cortisone-sensitive cells, the absolute number of cortisone-resistant cells remaining equivalent to normal males and females. Thus, the increased thymic weight of the female also resided in the cortisone-sensitive population. Peripheral lymphocyte counts in castrated animals exceeded both normal males and females. Further experiments in gonadectomized males provided evidence that increased thymic cell activity per se played a role in enhanced response to <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>antigens,</b> but that a thymic-derived hormone mediated the enhanced effect to the thymus-independent antigen in the castrated animal. The capacity for loss of androgenic hormone-producing tissue to generate enhanced differentiation of stem cells was denoted by experiments in which numbers of spleen colonies and uptake of 59 Fe, employed as an index of hematopoiesis 1 wk after reconstitution of lethally irradiated castrated and normal recipients, were enhanced in gonadectomized male animals. Thus, in summary, changes in sex hormone levels exerted a marked influence on immune responsiveness and stem cell differentiation, by increasing numbers of functioning cells, by promoting cellular differentiation, as well as by promoting cellular function via hormonal effects...|$|R
