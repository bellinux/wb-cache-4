40|$|The {{amount of}} {{titration}} acid in must {{is in the}} largest number of cases with in the range 5. 0 - 8. 0 g/dm 3. Wines, as a rule, contain less acids than must, and according to Regulations, titratable acidity is in the range of 4. 0 - 8. 0 g/dm 3 expressed in tartaric acid, because a part of tartaric acid is deposited in the form of salts (tartar or argol) during alcohol fermentation. For wines that contain less than 4 g/dm 3 of titratable acids there arises a suspicion about their origin, that is, that during the preparation some illegal acts were done. Because of that, the aim {{of this paper is to}} determine titratable acidity in white wine, using standard methods of determination, which are compared with the results received by potentiometric titration using ion-selective electrode. According to the received results it can be seen that wine <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>indicator</b> gives sufficient reliable values of wine titration acidity. However, as potentiometric titration at pH value 7. 00 is more reliable and objective method, the values of titratable acids content in wine, expressed through tartaric acid, are given according to this result. The analysis of differential potentiometric curves shows that these curves can give us an answer to the question of the presence of a larger amount of other nonorganic substances, which have already existed in wine. However, none of the used methods gives absolutely reliable answer what substances are present in analysed samples...|$|E

The accuracy of both methods as a function of molecular weight was also investigated and compared to results obtained using 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|Halide {{clusters}} {{have not}} been used as catalysts. Hexanuclear molecular halide clusters of niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, and tungsten possessing an octahedral metal framework are chosen as catalyst precursors. The prepared clusters have no metal–metal multiple bonds or coordinatively unsaturated sites and therefore required activation. In a hydrogen or helium stream, the clusters are treated at increasingly higher temperatures. Above 150 – 250 °C, catalytically active sites develop, and the cluster framework is retained up to 350 – 450 °C. One of the active sites is a Brønsted acid resulting from a hydroxo ligand that is produced by the elimination of hydrogen halide from the halogen and aqua ligands. The other active site is a coordinatively unsaturated metal, which can be isoelectronic with the platinum group metals by taking two or more electrons from the halogen ligands. In {{the case of the}} rhenium chloride cluster Re 3 Cl 9, the cluster framework is stable at least up to 300 °C under inert atmosphere; however, it is reduced to metallic rhenium at 250 – 300 °C under hydrogen. The activated clusters are characterized by X-ray diffraction analyses, Raman spectrometry, extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis, infrared spectrometry, acid <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> Hammett <b>indicators,</b> and elemental analyses...|$|R

Esta técnica apresenta dificuldades quando são analisadas amostras com intensa coloração. Tendo em vista a necessidade de uma metodologia mais adequada para estas amostras, foram feitas modificações no método tradicional e sua eficácia foi comprovada. Testes comparativos foram realizados entre a metodologia original, a modificada e um método cromatográfico. Seis diferentes geleias de frutas foram analisadas e as modificações propostas foram satisfatórias, ao passo que os resultados foram mais semelhantes aos obtidos pelo método cromatográfico. O sistema apresentou-se linear, repetitivo (desvio padrão de 2, 50 %), com alta recuperação (102, 10 %), e uma economia de 92, 88 % de reagentes foi realizada. Foram encontradas concentrações entre 0 a 6, 08 mg de ácido ascórbico por 100 g de amostra.

In first <b>titrations</b> <b>with</b> the [Fe(bipy) 2] 3 +/Fe[(bipy) 2] 2 + redox mediator couple Mrl 2 could not be fully reduced (data not shown), therefore the [Fe(CN) 6] 3 –/[Fe(CN) 6] 4 – couple with the lower standard potential was applied.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on iodometry. Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex <b>with</b> the starch <b>indicator.</b> [...] This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|R
