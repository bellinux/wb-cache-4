5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film.

For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader.

5|$|Minnehaha Falls {{received}} pilgrimages {{from fans}} of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business {{people wanted to}} harness its power. In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls, a goal the state {{tried and failed to}} achieve. In 1888, Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall and to build a city park there. In the 1890s, Cleveland's Minnehaha Park was annexed <b>to</b> <b>Minneapolis</b> and completed the Grand Rounds. Today Minnehaha Park sees 500,000 visitors each year. Named by Folwell, the 52-mile (83km) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast, Minneapolis to Theodore Wirth Park, to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown.|$|E
5|$|Pat O'Connor, a {{champion}} amateur wrestler who had competed at the Pan American and the British Empire Games, {{was discovered by}} visiting American wrestlers Joe Pazandak and Butch Levy and taken back <b>to</b> <b>Minneapolis,</b> Minnesota, where he eventually became a major star in the National Wrestling Alliance and the American Wrestling Association. On 9 January 1959, O'Connor defeated Dick Hutton in St. Louis, Missouri {{to become the first}} wrestler from New Zealand to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Over the next 20 years, many other wrestlers from New Zealand became big name stars in the United States. Abe Jacobs {{was among the first to}} follow O'Connor to the US and later challenged him for the NWA World title in New York. This was the first time two New Zealanders fought for a world heavyweight championship, and on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service <b>to</b> <b>Minneapolis.</b> In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E
