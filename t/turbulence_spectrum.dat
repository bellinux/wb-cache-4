This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{analysis of the}} <b>turbulence</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the solar wind in the near-Sun region R < 50 R⊙, obtained from interplanetary scintillation measurements with the Ooty Radio Telescope at 327 MHz. The results clearly show that the scintillation is dominated by density irregularities of size about 100 − 500 km. The scintillation at the small-scale side of the spectrum, although significantly less in magnitude, has a flatter spectrum than the larger-scale dominant part. Furthermore, the spectral power contained in the flatter portion rapidly increases closer to the Sun.

40|$|With the {{diffusion}} approximation, we study the cascade and damping of Alfvén-cyclotron fluctuations in solar plasmas numerically. Motivated by wave-wave couplings and nonlinear effects, we test several forms of {{the diffusion}} tensor. For a general locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion tensor in the wave vector space, the <b>turbulence</b> <b>spectrum</b> in the inertial range can be fitted with power-laws with the power-law index varying with the wave propagation direction. For several locally isotropic but inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients, the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly isotropic {{in the absence of}} damping and can be fitted by a single power-law function. However, the energy flux is strongly polarized due to the inhomogeneity that leads to an anisotropic cascade. Including the anisotropic thermal damping, the <b>turbulence</b> <b>spectrum</b> cuts off at the wave numbers, where the damping rates become comparable to the cascade rates. The combined anisotropic effects of cascade and damping make this cutoff wave number dependent on the wave propagation direction, and the propagation direction integrated <b>turbulence</b> <b>spectrum</b> resembles a broken power-law, which cuts off at the maximum of the cutoff wave numbers or the ^ 4 He cyclotron frequency. Taking into account the Doppler effects, the model can naturally reproduce the broken power-law wave spectra observed in the solar wind and predicts that a higher break frequency is aways accompanied with a greater spectral index change that may be caused by the increase of the Alfvén Mach number, the reciprocal of the plasma beta, and/or the angle between the solar wind velocity and the mean magnetic field.

However in many applications Gaussian spectra do not correspond to real <b>turbulence</b> <b>spectra.</b> Thus in turbo-machines the von Kármán, Liepmann, and modified von Kármán spectra are more realistic model spectra.
