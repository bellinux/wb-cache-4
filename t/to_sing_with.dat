5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability <b>to</b> <b>sing.</b> <b>With</b> efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{to keep a}} {{souvenir}} of his voice before it broke, Maunier decided <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> Clemence Saint-Preux and had released the single, Concerto pour deux voix, which was in turn an adaptation of Concerto pour une Voix.|$|E

Balasubrahmanyam.|$|E
25|$|Roger {{had once}} dreamed of {{becoming}} a singer, but his father Arcade disapproved, inspiring him {{to have one of}} his children learn <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> him in church. Mireille included his operatic voice on her 1968 Christmas album, where it was mixed in with the Minuit Chrétiens song. Mireille's first paid performance before an audience, at age four, was rewarded with a lollipop when she sang on Christmas Eve 1950 during Midnight Mass. A defining moment was seeing Édith Piaf sing on television.|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of The Beatles, combined with personal problems {{between the two}} performers, Broussard's homesickness, and a serious illness which landed Houston in the hospital, caused the duo to separate in 1965. Grace returned <b>to</b> <b>singing</b> <b>with</b> her brother.|$|R

Bell was {{introduced}} to Leslie Harvey, by his older brother Alex, after getting up on stage <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> the latter. Leslie Harvey was, at that time, a guitarist with the Kinning Park Ramblers. Bell joined the group as one of the vocalists. After the band split up, Bell moved to the Mecca Band at the Sauchiehall Street Locarno, and later to the Dennistoun Palais Band.|$|E
25|$|Janis {{remained}} at Woodstock {{for the remainder}} of the festival. She is said to have really enjoyed Sly and The Family Stone's performance immediately after hers. Starting at approximately 3:00a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills & Nash during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform with Neil Young. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir And a Voice <b>to</b> <b>Sing</b> <b>With</b> (1989).|$|E
25|$|Late in 1851 Cruvelli {{went to the}} Théâtre-Italien for the winter, and the {{following}} spring returned to London <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> Gardoni and Lablache, appearing in La Sonnambula and Il barbiere di Siviglia, Ernani and Fidelio. However, {{the affairs of the}} theatre were failing, a situation fed by rumour and despondency. Lumley's company made valiant efforts: the stalwarts, Cruvelli, Lablache, and Gardoni sang Norma, and were powerful attractions. Lumley had achieved the remarkable coup of booking the soprano Johanna Jachmann-Wagner to sing at Her Majesty's in May 1852, but she (or her father and agent Albert, Richard Wagner's brother) were bribed by a better offer from the Covent Garden management and broke their contract. A lawsuit followed.|$|E
50|$|Fayette {{subsequently}} {{earned a}} Bachelor's {{degree in psychology}} from Temple University and a Master's degree in human services from Lincoln University in 1984.

25|$|During {{basketball}} practice, Troy {{has trouble}} focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella {{and the idea}} that he might enjoy singing more than basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late. After Ms. Darbus attempts to leave, Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drops her music sheets. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.|$|E
25|$|In {{this period}} Lata Mangeshkar has {{recorded}} duets with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, and Kishore Kumar. For {{a brief period}} during the 1960s, she was not on good terms with Mohammed Rafi {{over the issue of}} royalty payments to singers. Mangeshkar wanted Rafi to back her in demanding a half-share from the five percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. But Rafi took a diametrically opposite view, and believed that a playback singer's claim on the filmmaker ended with the payment of the agreed fee for the song. This led to tensions between the two. After an argument during the recording of the song Tasveer Teri Dil Mein (Maya, 1961), the two refused <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> each other. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two.|$|E

25|$|With a placid personality, Infante Francisco de Paula {{was more}} {{interested}} in art than in politics. The Infante, who in his childhood had received drawing lessons from the court painter and miniaturist Antonio Carnicero, was himself an amateur painter. Some of his works, including an oil painting of Saint Jerome, have survived. The Infante's main passion was music. Until he was forced to leave Spain for exile in 1808, he received music lessons from Pedro Anselmo Marchal and violin lessons from Francesco Vaccari. The Infante was a skillful singer with a good bass singing voice. His rooms at the Royal Palace were a gathering place for musicians and singers and he used <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> them. The Infante also sang during musical evenings at the royal palace in the company of professional singers. From his youth until the end of his life, Francisco de Paula gathered an extensive sheet music collection that included almost 700 scores. This collection, acquired by the Biblioteca Nacional de España, has been preserved to this day. When Ferdinand VII created the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1830, the infante was made an honorary member.|$|E
500|$|Fourteen-year-old {{country music}} singer Virginia [...] "Ginny" [...] Hensley, {{who later became}} Patsy Cline, began her career by making her {{broadcast}} debut on WINC in 1948. Hensley asked [...] "Joltin'" [...] Jim McCoy, {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] called [...] "The Melody Playboys", about to perform on the station, for a chance <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> them. She told the band leader, [...] "If you just give me a chance <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> you, I'll never ask for pay." [...] Cline continued to perform regularly on Saturday mornings on WINC. [...] In 1948 and 1949, respectively, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope visited WINC, where they were interviewed on-the-air. Crosby and Hope were each in town for the city's annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival.|$|E
500|$|Baez {{recalled}} {{her relationship}} with Dylan in Martin Scorsese's documentary film No Direction Home (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies—admiringly in Daybreak (1968), and less admiringly in And A Voice <b>to</b> <b>Sing</b> <b>With</b> (1987). Baez's relationship with Dylan {{is the subject of}} her song [...] "Diamonds & Rust", which has been described as [...] "an acute portrait" [...] of Dylan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of Cuba's sextet {{began to rise}} when José [...] "Cheo" [...] Feliciano joined the group. This occurred when José Curbelo's vocalist Santitos Colón replaced Gilberto Monroig in Tito Puente's band. Willie Torres then left Joe Cuba's Sextet, and replaced Santitos in Curbelo's orchestra. This {{opened the door for}} Cheo with Joe Cuba. This worked out perfectly for Cuba. Feliciano was selected <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> songs <b>with</b> Spanish lyrics, while Sabater was selected <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> songs <b>with</b> English lyrics.|$|R

5000|$|In 1952, {{streptomycin}} {{emerged as}} a treatment for tuberculosis, and Gandharva began to take it. Gradually, helped by excellent medical support and care from wife Bhanumati, he recovered and began singing again. However, his voice and singing style would always bear the scars of his illness: one of his lungs had been rendered useless, so he had <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>singing</b> <b>with</b> a single lung.|$|R
500|$|Mambo {{does not}} write her own songs; rather {{she uses the}} works of {{numerous}} Indonesian songwriters, including Melly Goeslaw and Glenn Fredly. Since leaving Ratu, Mambo has [...] successfully distanced herself from her coquettish, ultra-feminine look. [...] Her on-stage [...] performance [...] is characterised as [...] very [...] "energetic"; she dances and mingles with the audience off stage, and invites them <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> her on stage. She often performs at clubs, using local bands for the music.|$|E

The album was both popular and critically praised. Bennett followed this by working with the Count Basie Orchestra, becoming the first male pop vocalist <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>with</b> Basie's band. The albums Basie Swings, Bennett Sings (1958) and In Person! (1959) were the well-regarded fruits of this collaboration, with [...] "Chicago" [...] being one of the standout songs.|$|E
