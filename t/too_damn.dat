500|$|In a mixed review, Luke McManus of RTÉ {{compared}} its {{songs to}} [...] "those jazzy Beastie Boys tracks", {{and described the}} sound as [...] "undemanding and smooth". However, McManus criticized the album's mood and wrote, [...] "Soporific, over polite and <b>too</b> <b>damn</b> quiet, Soul Food Taqueira veers dangerously close to snooze territory." [...] Bryan Carroll of Allmusic criticized the predominance of [...] "mood pieces", and stated, [...] "on the whole Soul Food Taqueria fails {{to stick to the}} ribs because it simply lacks the proper spice". Other critics cited Guerrero's simple, inventive style and sound for the album as one of its better qualities. Bill Campbell of Ink 19 called the album an [...] "exemplary album ... 100% soul". He also commended Guerrero's musicality, [...] "he constructs heartfelt music with a complexity few can pull off successfully", as well as his guitar playing, as Campbell wrote [...] "his guitar work is subtle and works the spaces between the beats marvelously".|$|E
500|$|Lauren Carter of Boston Herald {{recommended}} [...] "Breaking Point" [...] as downloadable, and Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago {{called it}} one of [...] "the finest cuts of genuine R out there right now". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy called the song [...] "beautiful" [...] and wrote, [...] "While the music has all the squiggly, burping and buzzing percussion sound effects of your typical [...] track, {{it also has a}} lovely Prince-like melody." [...] The Guardian Caroline Sullivan regarded it as [...] "deceptively sugary [...] trilling" [...] and commented that it [...] "does observe that some women 'tolerate <b>too</b> <b>damn</b> much', but it's easily missed". Karen Tye of The Advertiser was mixed and felt that Hilson [...] "invokes" [...] Knowles on [...] "Breaking Point", writing that she [...] "needs to work on establishing her own distinct voice". Negative reviews came from Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, who named it as one of the album's [...] "failed attempts at pop crossover", and IGN's Chad Grischow, who viewed the ballad as [...] "fed-up". Grischow criticized the production for [...] "clumsily" [...] attempting to mix Motown vocals with voice-box guitars and organs.|$|E

500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad that {{features}} elements of pop and soul music. Instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, kick drums, an organ, percussion and a piano. It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe. Hilson phrases: [...] "Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves, cause see, some women just tolerate <b>too</b> <b>damn</b> much. Huh!" ...|$|E
500|$|Author J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his {{biography}} of Madonna, called [...] "Borderline", along with [...] "Holiday", the two key recordings which helped in establishing Madonna's {{base in the}} music industry. He added that Madonna's sober voice made the track [...] "as close to an old Motown production as a hit could get in the dance-music-driven eighties." [...] Author Maury Dean in his book, Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush, called the song [...] "echoey boogie" [...] with [...] "saucy-style and come-hither magnetism." [...] Author Rikky Rooksby in his book, The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, called it harmonically the most complex track of her debut album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song effervescent. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song soulful. Commentator Dave Marsh in his book, The Heart of Rock & Soul, said that the [...] "music's <b>too</b> <b>damn</b> good to be denied, no matter whose value system it disrupts." [...] Journalist Roxanne Orgill in her book, Shout, Sister, Shout!, commented that [...] "Borderline" [...] was the song which made Madonna the star she is. Thom Duffy of Orlando Sentinel commented that [...] "Borderline" [...] was a song that [...] "introduced Madonna, the helium-induced pop star, and a siren kitten." ...|$|E

Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the [...] "largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only made {{for the sole purpose}} of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music." [...] He's also criticized lip-synching and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as Nu metal for rock music and Neo soul for soul music. He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his day job as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band Home Cookin' in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to [...] "work with a label, not for them." [...] Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that [...] "the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one." [...] He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to [...] "change...music for the sake of pop radio." [...] He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio airplay—where one hears [...] "the exact same songs 3 months at a time." [...] When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions. Holding that compact discs are [...] "just <b>too</b> <b>damn</b> expensive", Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would [...] "deter people from downloading for free." [...] Conversely, he notes that artists—who [...] "don't get as much money as you think"—need to be compensated for their work. His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Metallica, Home Cookin', and Bob Schneider.|$|E
