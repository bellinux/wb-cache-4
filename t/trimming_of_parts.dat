40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} flight validation of an embedded fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) based structural health monitoring (SHM) system for the Indian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Nishant. The embedding of the sensors was integrated with the manufacturing process, {{taking into account the}} <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> and assembly considerations. Reliable flight data were recorded on board the vehicle and analyzed so that deviations from normal structural behaviors could be identified, evaluated and tracked. Based on the data obtained, it was possible to track both the loads and vibration signatures by direct sensors’ cross correlation using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Sensor placement combined with proper ground calibration, enabled the distinction between strain and temperature readings. The start of a minor local structural temporary instability was identified during landing, proving the value of such continuous structural airworthy assessment for UAV structures...|$|E

50|$|Both {{elevator}} trim and pitch trim affect the small <b>trimming</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the elevator on jet airliners. The former {{is supposed to}} be set in a certain position for a longer time, while the pitch trim (controlled with the landing pilot's thumb on the yoke or joystick, and is thereby easy to maneuver) is used all the time after the flying pilot has disabled the autopilot, especially after each time the flaps are lowered or at every change in the airspeed, at the descent, approach and final. Elevator trim is most used for controlling the attitude at cruising by the autopilot.|$|R

40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is inevitably moving towards lighter, {{faster and more}} versatile aircraft, {{which has led to}} tighter manufacturing standards for both commercial and military aircraft. This has led to a wide use of automation for the manufacture of aircraft components. In aircraft manufacture, the labour required for assembly procedures can account for as much as 50 % of the total cost of the assembly; drilling and riveting account for a large fraction of that cost. One of the areas of highest value added is in the drilling and <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> aircraft <b>parts.</b> It is not uncommon for a wing, horizontal stabiliser or engine strut to have hundreds, even thousands, of holes to be drilled prior to installing fasteners. The material used in the manufacture of an elevator is very expensive; therefore the mistakes can be costly. So, many manufacturers have identified drilling as a candidate for automation. In most cases a robot or robot like machine will be used for this application. At present, the drilling of thousands of holes involves the frequent loading and unloading of drill guides and is done manually. This results in high labour costs. In this thesis, we will focus on the manufacture of elevators and investigate the possibilities of automating the drilling process associated with it. A simulation study was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of robotic drilling. This study was carried out with the Interactive Graphic Robot Instruction Program software package...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFootrot, {{including}} interdigital dermatitis, {{is caused}} by Dichelobacter nodosus cause the majority of lameness in sheep in the UK. Lame sheep often have overgrown hoof horn but recent evidence has indicated that trimming overgrown hoof horn increases recovery time, and that routine foot <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> the flock does not reduce the prevalence or incidence of lameness. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the temporal associations between hoof horn length, footrot and climate. Fifty multiparous ewes were monitored for 10 months. On eight occasions hoof horn length, foot lesions and body condition were recorded. At the first examination, ewes were assigned to one of two treatment groups. All ewes that became lame with footrot were treated at one time point per week, either by trimming hoof horn and applying a topical antibiotic spray or with parenteral antibiotic and topical antibiotic spray. Hoof horn length in ewes at pasture varied over the year and was associated with temperature and rainfall. New cases of footrot occurred all year round and were associated with prior prevalence of footrot in the flock and prior temperature and rainfall. Overgrown hoof horn did not precede lameness but occurred once the sheep were lame. One year of prompt treatment of footrot reduced the range in hoof horn length in the sheep in both treatment groups. At {{the end of the study}} the hoof lengths of ewes in both groups were not significantly different. On this farm, hoof horn length was self-regulating in both non-lame and treated lame sheep whether <b>trimming</b> was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the treatment or not and there would have been no benefit from routine foot <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> this flock...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} decide which <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a VN request to embed, if at all, the InP can use {{existing}} intra-domain VN embedding algorithms [6, 8] that can identify conflicting resource requirements in a VN request. This can be done iteratively by looking into {{the output of the}} linear programs used in both [6, 8] without modifying the actual algorithms presented in those work, and <b>trimming</b> out <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the virtual network until a feasible solution is found. However, we argue that this heuristic may not be sufficient for high quality or even feasible partial embeddings. In particular, we must ensure that if an InP maps a virtual link, it also maps the two nodes incident to it. We also wish to minimize the number of virtual links that map across multiple domains as inter-domain paths tend to be long and thus are more costly.|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a rat model of epidural plastic bead implantation {{to study the}} effect of physical com-pression on the cerebral cortex. Epidural implantation of a bead of appropriate size compressed the underlying sensorimotor cortex without apparent ischemia, since the capillary density of the cortex was increased. Although the thickness of all layers of the compressed cortex was significantly de-creased, no apparent changes {{in the number of}} NADPH-diaphorase reactive neurons, reactive as-trocytes, or microglial cells were observed, nor were apoptotic neurons observed. In fact, the den-sities of the neurons in most cortical layers apparently increased. To determine how epidural compression affects neuronal morphology, the dendritic arbors of layer III and V pyramidal neu-rons were evaluated using a fixed tissue intracellular dye injection technique. Neurons in both lay-ers remained pyramidal in shape and their somatic sizes remained unaltered for at least a month after compression. On the other hand, their total dendritic length was significantly reduced begin-ning at 3 days post implantation. These analyses showed that apical dendrites were affected sooner than basal ones. The reduction of dendritic length was associated with a drop in the number of den-dritic branches rather than dendritic trunks, suggesting the <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the dendritic arbor. Detailed analysis showed that dendritic spines on all dendrites were reduced as early as 3 days following implantation. These results suggest that cortical neurons remodel their structures substantially within 3 days after being subjected to epidural compression.

40|$|Abstract. Given current {{research}} initiatives advocating “clean slate” Internet designs, researchers {{have the opportunity}} to design an internet-work layer routing protocol that provides efficient anonymity by decou-pling identity from network location. Prior work in anonymity for the next-generation Internet fully trusts the user’s ISP. We propose Dove-tail, which provides anonymity against an active attacker located at any single point within the network, including the user’s ISP. A major design challenge is to provide this protection without including an application-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this in path construction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path segments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then <b>trims</b> away <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. We develop a systematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our de-signs, and we demonstrate their privacy and efficiency by Internet-scale simulations at the AS-level. ...|$|R

40|$|Support Vector Machines are {{a widely}} used {{classification}} technique. They are computationally efficient and provide excellent predictions even for high-dimensional data. Moreover, Support Vector Machines are very flexible {{due to the}} incorporation of kernel functions. The latter allow to model nonlinearity, but also to deal with nonnumerical data such as protein strings. However, Support Vector Machines can suffer a lot from unclean data containing, for example, outliers or mislabeled observations. Although several outlier detection schemes have been proposed in the literature, the selection of outliers versus nonoutliers is often rather ad hoc and does not provide much insight in the data. In robust multivariate statistics outlier maps are quite popular tools to assess the quality of data under consideration. They provide a visual representation of the data depicting several types of outliers. This paper proposes an outlier map designed for Support Vector Machine classification. The Stahel [...] Donoho outlyingness measure from multivariate statistics is extended to an arbitrary kernel space. A <b>trimmed</b> version <b>of</b> Support Vector Machines is defined <b>trimming</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the samples with largest outlyingness.
