40|$|Video {{games are}} kids' stuff" may be {{still in the}} minds of many people. But the video games {{industry}} is far beyond its infancy and has already grown into a multi-billion dollar business. The NPD Group reports that in 2007 the revenues generated in the U. S. with video game soft- and hardware for consoles and personal computers reached a total of 18. 8 billion dollars, a 40 percent increase over 2006. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the global sales will even surpass those of the music industry within the next years. With the success of the Internet, online games are a constantly increasing part of these sales. According to DFC Intelligence, the worldwide online game market will grow to over 13 billion dollars in 2011. The probably most successful online game genre today is that of the so-called Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). This kind of games provides vast virtual worlds, where thousands of players can meet and interact simultaneously. Most of these worlds are persistent, i. e. they may be online for years. They are hosted on Internet servers which are online 24 / 7 and players can join and leave the game whenever they like to. The persistence of the game world allows for long-term development of virtual avatars with individual characteristics and possessions. The leader of the MMOG market today is Blizzard Entertainment with the title World of Warcraft. In the beginning of 2008, World of Warcraft had 10 million subscribers (each paying up to 15 dollars per month) and a market share of 62 percent. Developing todays video games is a complex and cost-intensive task and multiplayer online functionality has a significant share in this. In 2008, the first video game hit the 100 million dollar mark for development costs. In addition to that, publishers of online games need to provide the necessary services to allow their customers to play the game over the Internet. Traditionally, most online games and nearly all MMOGs are built relying on the Client/Server architecture. The client software runs on the player's computers and shows only an audio-visual representation of the game world. It accepts commands issued by the player and transmits them to the server. Processing the commands and managing the state of the game is completely done on the server-side. Thus, to be able to handle hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously, large amounts of computing power and network bandwidth are required. Additionally, the service requires a large staff for server maintenance, software updates, billing and customer services. The provision of the World of Warcraft service did cost about 200 million dollars since its launch in November 2004. In addition to the effort of maintaining a multiplayer online game service after its launch there arises another challenge: keeping the game free of cheaters. A cheater may be defined as a user that performs an action that gives an advantage over his opponents that is considered unfair by the game developer. One must be aware that cheating is a major concern in multiplayer games as it seriously affects the game experience of honest players. Especially for subscription-based online games this is fatal, since customers will cancel their subscriptions if the experience doesn't meet their expectations. Game publishers usually do not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of players that they believe to have cheated. For example, in 2006 Blizzard Entertainment announced in their forums that they have banned 59, 000 players from World of Warcraft within a single month...|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{specific}} tax legislation and practice {{dealing with the}} taxation of derivatives in South Africa necessitates {{the construction of a}} framework for the taxation of derivatives: the subject of this dissertation. The lack of sophistication within the Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 and the lack of clarity provided by the South African Revenue Service with regard to derivatives, specifically in a hedging context, is expected to be overcome to a large degree by virtue of the contents of this dissertation. The dissertation considers the meaning of a derivative and a hedge in a tax context and culminates in the drafting of suggested definitions of a derivative and a hedge to be housed within our tax legislation. The definitions have been constructed from key themes and features extracted from various comparative studies. Given <b>the</b> changes in <b>accounting</b> methodologies and practice of derivative transactions, it is considered that the need, from a tax perspective, is <b>to</b> move <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> treatment of gains and losses on derivative transactions. The analysis in this dissertation favours this approach in the instance specifically where derivatives are transacted as a hedge of an underlying capital transaction. The purposes for which derivatives are used are finally considered specifically {{in the context of the}} common law doctrine of substance over form. The subjective test of the taxpayer’s mindset plays a major part in balancing the legal form of a transaction and its legal substance.
