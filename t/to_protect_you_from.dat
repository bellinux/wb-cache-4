Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king.

When you hear “seafood safety”, think of a safety net designed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you,</b> the consumer, <b>from</b> food-borne illness. Every facet of the seafood industry, from harvester to consumer, plays a role in holding up the safety net. The role of state and federal agencies, fishermen, aquaculturists, retailers, processors, restaurants, and scientists is to provide, update, and carry out the necessary handling, processing, and inspection procedures to give consumers the safest seafood possible. The consumer’s responsibility is to follow through with proper handling techniques, from purchase to preparation. It doesn’t matter how many regulations and inspection procedures are set up; the final edge of the safety net is held by the consumer. This article will give you the information you need to educate yourself and be assured that the fish and shellfish you consume are safe. The most common food-borne illnesses are caused by a combination of bacteria naturally present in our environment and food handling errors made in commercial settings, food service institutions, or at home...|$|R

Vaccines and Pregnancy In every pregnancy, a woman starts out with a 3 - 5 % chance of having a baby with a birth defect. This is called her {{background}} risk. This sheet talks about whether exposure to vaccines may increase the risk for birth defects over that background risk. This information should not {{take the place of}} medical care and advice from your health care professional. What are vaccines? Vaccines are given <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> various diseases. They are made from killed or weakened bacteria or virus. Vaccines cause your body’s immune system to make antibodies. Once these antibodies are made they <b>protect</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> getting sick if you are exposed to that disease. What is the difference between a live and inactivated vaccine? A “live vaccine ” is made from live viruses or bacteria that have been weakened. This causes the body to make protective antibodies but does not usually cause the infection. Live vaccines generally provide long-lasting protection with a single dose. Given the slight possibility that a live vaccine might cause the disease itself, live vaccines are not routinely given to pregnant women. An “inactivated vaccine ” is made from viruses or bacteria that have been killed. An inactivated vaccine cannot cause the disease that it is given to prevent. Inactivated vaccines may require multiple doses and periodic boosters to provide the best protection. Which vaccines can be given safely in pregnancy? Which vaccines should not be given in pregnancy? Inactivated vaccines have not been shown to cause birth defects or pregnancy complications. Live vaccines are usually not given in pregnancy because of the slight possibility of causing the disease in the mother or baby. However, when the likelihood of being exposed to a disease is high or when infection would pose a high risk to the mother or baby, vaccination with a live vaccine is sometimes considered. If there is a rare disease outbreak or you are traveling outside of North America and require a specific vaccine, please call OTIS at 866 - 626 - 6847 for more information. You can also refer to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ...|$|R
5000|$|Government {{and local}} {{authorities}} rely on Facebook and other social networks to investigate crimes and obtain evidence to help establish a crime, provide location information, establish motives, prove and disprove alibis, and reveal communications. Federal, state, and local investigations have not been restricted to profiles that are publicly available or willingly provided to the government; Facebook has willingly provided information in response to government subpoenas or requests, except with regard to private, unopened inbox messages less than 181 days old, which require a warrant and a finding of probable cause under federal law. An article by Junichi Semitsu published in the Pace Law Review reports that [...] "even when the government lacks reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and the user opts for the strictest privacy controls, Facebook users still cannot expect federal law to stop their private content and communications from being used against them. [...] " [...] Facebooks privacy policy states that [...] "We may also share information {{when we have a}} good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> ourselves and <b>you</b> <b>from</b> people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities." [...] Since Congress has failed to meaningfully amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> most communications on social-networking sites such as Facebook, and since the Supreme Court has largely refused to recognize a Fourth Amendment privacy right to information shared with a third party, there is no federal statutory or constitutional right that prevents the government from issuing requests that amount to fishing expeditions and there is no Facebook privacy policy that forbids the company from handing over private user information that suggests any illegal activity.|$|R
