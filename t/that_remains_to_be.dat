5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} question <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> answered is what language or languages were spoken {{by the people}} and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During {{the first part of}} the Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. Terrence Kaufman has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period. Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-Nahuan, a southern Uto-Aztecan language, moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved somehow in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.|$|E

2500|$|In {{traditional}} Judaism, {{marriage is}} viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which {{a man and a woman}} come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. (...) Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfill the commandment to have children. (...) In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered [...] "incomplete" [...] if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unified. Some Jewish denominations such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism recognize same-sex marriage and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple. However, this point of view is considered as a diversion from the Jewish Law by the Orthodox denominations, rather than as a legitimate, alternative interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|Ferdinand I (c. 1015 – 24 December 1065), {{called the}} Great (el Magno), was the Count of Castile from his uncle's death in 1029 and the King of León after {{defeating}} his brother-in-law in 1037. According to tradition, {{he was the}} first to have himself crowned Emperor of Spain (1056), and his heirs carried on the tradition. He was a younger son of Sancho III of Navarre and Muniadona of Castile, and by his father's will recognised the supremacy of his eldest brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre.

2500|$|Critic Robert McMahon thinks Congress {{has been}} {{excluded}} from foreign policy decision making, {{and that this}} is detrimental. Other writers suggest a need for greater Congressional participation. Jim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and former Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, believes that Congress has an ever-decreasing role in U.S. foreign policy making. September 11, 2001 precipitated this change, where [...] "powers quickly shifted quickly to the Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety during a time of war." [...] Since that time, Webb thinks Congress has become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign policy. He cites the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA), the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, and the 2011 military intervention in Libya as examples of growing legislative irrelevance. Regarding the SFA, [...] "Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way. Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq" [...] (11). [...] "Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S. policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the world." [...] The Iraqi Parliament, by contrast, voted on the measure twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is described by the Obama Administration has a [...] "legally binding executive agreement" [...] that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and designated Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally. [...] "It is difficult to understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as legally binding in our constitutional system," [...] Webb argues. Finally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling historical precedent. [...] "The issue in play in Libya was not simply whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the War Powers Act, which in this writer's view he clearly did. The issue <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer money." [...] When the military campaign lasted months, President Barack Obama did not seek approval of Congress to continue military activity.|$|E
