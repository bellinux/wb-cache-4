40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the use of the}} Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition and network flow on bipartite graphs to improve a graph bisection partition. Given a graph partition [S; B; W] with a vertex separator S and two disconnected components B and W, different strategies are considered based on the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition to reduce the separator size jSj and/or the imbalance between B and W. For the case when the vertices are weighted, we relate this with the bipartite network flow problem. A further enhancement is made on partition improvement by generalizing the bipartite network to solving a general network flow problem. We demonstrate the utility of these improvement techniques on a set of sparse test matrices, where we find <b>top</b> level <b>separators</b> and nested dissection and multisection orderings.

The suspended solids settles {{to the bottom of the}} separator as a sediment layer, the oil rises to <b>top</b> of the <b>separator</b> and the cleansed wastewater is the middle layer between the oil layer and the solids.|$|R
30|$|This {{study had}} {{approval}} from the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (protocol # 201407792). Testing was performed in the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) core clinical laboratory. The layout and informatics of this clinical laboratory has been detailed in previous publications (Krasowski et al. 2014, 2015). The inclusion criteria were: (1) patient who had free light chain analysis performed on a serum specimen, (2) EDTA-anticoagulated and lithium heparin PST specimens drawn on patient for clinical testing during same phlebotomy encounter, and (3) sufficient specimen remaining in the EDTA and PST specimens for light chain analysis after performance of provider-ordered clinical testing. The details on the three specimen types were: BD Vacutainer® red top silica clot activator coated tube (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ), BD Vacutainer® light green <b>top</b> plasma <b>separator</b> tubes (PST™) containing polymer gel and lithium heparin (BD Diagnostics), and BD Vacutainer® pink top spray coated K 2 EDTA tube (BD Diagnostics). No extra tubes were drawn on any patient {{for purposes of this}} study, i.e., all analyses used pre-existing specimens leftover from clinical testing that would otherwise have been discarded.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{trapping}} of Mn cations by polymeric crown ethers as a {{mitigation measure}} {{for the consequences}} of Mn dissolution in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Mn cations trapping by poly(vinylbenzo- 18 -crown- 6) and poly(undecylenyloxymethyl- 18 -crown- 6) was investigated for 1 M LiPF 6 solutions in binary carbonates containing Mn(II) salts and in lithium manganese oxide (LMO) spinel – graphite (GR) cells. Trapping site occupancies by Mn+ 2 exceeding 90 % were measured in bench <b>top</b> experiments. Polyethylene <b>separators</b> coated with poly(vinylbenzo- 18 -crown- 6) trapped Mn cations in LMO- GR cells and decreased capacity fade during 100 cycles at high temperature (60 ◦C) and C/ 4 rate, retaining 26 % more capacity than the baseline cells.

50|$|The API {{separator}} is a gravity {{separation device}} designed using Stokes' law principles {{that define the}} rise velocity of oil droplets based on their density, size and water properties. The design of the separator {{is based on the}} specific gravity difference between the oil and the wastewater because that difference is much smaller than the specific gravity difference between the suspended solids and water. Based on that design criterion, most of the suspended solids will settle {{to the bottom of the}} separator as a sediment layer, the oil will rise to <b>top</b> of the <b>separator,</b> and the wastewater will be the middle layer between the oil on top and the solids on the bottom. The API Design Standards, when correctly applied, make adjustments to the geometry, design and size of the separator beyond simple Stokes Law principles. This includes allowances for water flow entrance and exit turbulence losses as well as other factors.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{description of}} tool design {{which is used}} for rough polishing of balls made of brittle materials. This tool consists of top disk, which is fi-eely set on pouring bearing of the separator shaft, and a bottom disk with elastic coating. Theoretical investigations of ball kinematics have permitted to determine an angular velocity of the balls in the machining zone, value and direction oi slipping speed {{with respect to the}} tool. it has been determined that even change of the position of bail rotation instantaneous axis relative to the separator is reached at equality of angular velocities of the bottom disk and the <b>separator.</b> When the <b>top</b> disk is freely set slipping speed is equal for all the balls of the machined lot. When the top disk is stationary slipping speed is significantly increasing however its value becomes variable and depends on ball distance to separator rotation axis.

2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils. The mixture of steam and water {{is led by the}} upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the steam separators, pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has [...] diameter, [...] length, wall thickness of , and weighs [...] Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken from the <b>top</b> of the <b>separators</b> by two steam collectors per separator, combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|R
40|$|The AQUAREL project {{studied the}} {{availability}} and optional utilization methods for fish processing side streams and other aquatic biomaterial in the Republic of Karelia. Additionally processing aquatic biomaterial with manure and sewage sludge was studied. Based on the results, the most feasible option today is to process fish side streams to fish oil and dewatered oil-free residue and to use them for fish or animal feed production. However, {{it is necessary to}} highlight, that changes in e. g. economic environment, energy prices and demand may require re-evaluating the results and conclusions made in the project. Producing fish oil from fish processing side streams is an easy and relatively simple production process generating a valuable end product. The functionality of the process was confirmed in a pilot conducted in the project. The oil and solids are separated from the heated fish waste based on gravity. The fish oil separating on <b>top</b> of the <b>separator</b> unit is removed. Fish oil can as such be utilized for heating purposes, fish meal or animal feed production, {{but it can also be}} further processed to biodiesel. However, due to currently moderate energy prices in Russia, biodiesel production is not economically profitable. Even if the fish oil production process is not complicated, the operative management of small-scale fish oil production unit requires dedicated resources and separate facilities especially to meet hygiene requirements. Managing the side streams is not a core business for fish farmers. Efficient and economically profitable fish oil production requires a centralized production unit with bigger processing capacity. One fish processing unit needs to be designed to manage side streams collected from several fish farms. The optimum location for the processing unit is in the middle of the fish farms. Based on the transportation cost analysis in the Republic of Karelia, it is not economically efficient to transport bio-wastes for more than 100 km since the transportation costs start increasing substantially. Another issue to be considered is that collection of side streams, including the dead fish, from the fish farms should be organized on a daily basis in order to eliminate the need for storing the side streams at the farms. Based on AQUAREL project studies there are different public funding sources available for supporting and enabling profitable and environmentally sustainable utilization, research or development of fish processing side streams and other aquatic biomaterial. Different funding programmes can be utilized by companies, research organizations, authorities and non-governmental organizations...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{criticality}} safety {{has become}} an important task in preparing for the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) uranium enrichment runs that will take place during the Integrated Process Demonstration (IPD) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This integrated operation of AVLIS systems under plant-like conditions {{will be used to}} verify the performance of process equipment and to demonstrate the sustained integrated enrichment performance of these systems using operating parameters that are similar to production plant specifications. Because of the potential criticality concerns associated with enriched uranium, substantial effort has been aimed towards understanding the potential system failures of interest from a criticality standpoint, and evaluating them in detail. The AVLIS process is based on selective photoionization of uranium atoms of atomic weight 235 (U- 235) in a vapor stream, followed by electrostatic extraction. The process is illustrated in Figure 1. Two major subsystems are involved: the uranium separator and the laser system. In the separator, metallic uranium is fed into a crucible where it is heated and vaporized by an electron beam. The atomic U- 235 /U- 238 vapor stream moves away from the molten uranium and is illuminated by precisely tuned beams of dye laser light. Upon absorption of the tuned dye laser light, the U- 235 atoms become excited and eject electrons (become photoionized), giving them a net positive charge. The ions of U- 235 are moved preferentially by an electrostatic field to condense on the product collector, forming the enriched uranium product. The remaining vapor, which is depleted in U- 235 (tails), passes unaffected through the photoionization/extractor zone and accumulates on collectors in the <b>top</b> of the <b>separator.</b> Tails and product collector surfaces operate at elevated temperatures so that deposited materials flow as segregated liquid streams. The separated uranium condensates (uranium enriched in U- 235 and uranium depleted in U- 235) are cooled and accumulated in solid metallic form in canisters. The collected product and tails material is weighed and transferred into certified, critically safe, shipping containers (DOT specification 6 M with 2 R containment vessel). These will be temporarily stored, and then shipped offsite either for use by a fuel fabricator, or for disposal. Tails material will be packaged for disposal. A criticality risk assessment was performed for AVLIS IPD runs. In this analysis, the likelihood of occurrence of a criticality was examined. For the AVLIS process, {{there are a number of}} areas that have been specifically examined to assess whether or not the frequency of occurrence of a criticality is credible (frequency of occurrence > 10 - 6 /yr). In this paper, we discuss only two of the areas: the separator and canister operations...|$|R
