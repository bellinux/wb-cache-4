500|$|Santer {{said there}} were three big clues to the killer's identity, [...] "one in the Christmas Day episode, one more {{recently}} than Christmas and there's another one that, if I were to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>where</b> it was, would perhaps give it away too easily," [...] however, in a chat with Sharon Marshall shown on This Morning on 18 February 2010, he said the second clue was about halfway through the investigation and the third was [...] "on screen but not necessarily in the programme". He {{also said that the}} outcome would be [...] "surprising", [...] "satisfying" [...] and [...] "in retrospect, inevitable", adding that [...] "it makes sense". Santer confirmed the clues in an interview on the EastEnders website: on Christmas Day Stacey disappears and it is never explained why, and then reappears on Boxing Day appearing [...] "not quite with it"; Stacey is the only character still sufficiently angry enough to spit on Archie's grave at his funeral; and Stacey is the first character to feature in the Christmas Day trailers.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>where</b> the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
