5|$|When {{an enzyme}} has {{multiple}} substrates, inhibitors can show {{different types of}} inhibition depending on which substrate is considered. This results from the active site containing two different binding sites within the active site, one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> B in the second binding site.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound <b>to</b> <b>substrate,</b> and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to expand}} the size and number of coral reefs {{generally}} involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home. Substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires, scuttled ships, subway cars, and formed concrete, such as reef balls. Reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs. In large restoration projects, propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins, superglue or milliput. Needle and thread can also attach A-hermatype coral <b>to</b> <b>substrate.</b>|$|E

The imagery will be analyzed to clear the shuttle for reentry. Meanwhile, the foam loss on the external tank was initially attributed <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> contamination ahead of {{the application of the}} foam. Later during the processing of STS-128, voids in the foam was highlighted as a trigger for the shedding. The air trapped in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in different ways, and in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern in ways that are specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle in the sand and appear one way, with another animal a few feet away in a slightly different microhabitat, settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E
25|$|Internally fertilized eggs {{develop in}} the polyp for a period ranging from days to weeks. Subsequent {{development}} produces a tiny larva, known as a planula. Externally fertilized eggs develop during synchronized spawning. Polyps release eggs and sperm into the water en masse, simultaneously. Eggs disperse over a large area. The timing of spawning depends on time of year, water temperature, and tidal and lunar cycles. Spawning is most successful when there is little variation {{between high and low}} tide. The less water movement, the better the chance for fertilization. Ideal timing occurs in the spring. Release of eggs or planula usually occurs at night, and is sometimes in phase with the lunar cycle (three to six days after a full moon). The period from release to settlement lasts only a few days, but some planulae can survive afloat for several weeks. They are vulnerable to predation and environmental conditions. The lucky few planulae which successfully attach <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> next confront competition for food and space.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{previous}} studies rat hepatocytes {{have been shown}} <b>to</b> adhere <b>to</b> <b>substrates</b> composed of collagen or fibronectin. In the present communication, the basement membrane protein laminin is reported to mediate the attachment and spreading of hepatocytes. The cell attachment-mediating activity of laminin was {{compared with that of}} fibronectin. The activity of fibronectin was heat sensitive, whereas laminin retained its activity after boiling. On the other hand, reduction and alkylation or periodate oxidation of the proteins affected only the cell attachment activity of laminin. Preincubation of cells with soluble fibronectin inhibited initial cell attachment to fibronectin but not <b>to</b> laminin <b>substrates,</b> and, reversely, soluble laminin selectively inhibited cell attachment to laminin. These results suggest that attachment of cells <b>to</b> <b>substrates</b> of the two proteins involves different cellular receptors recognizing distinct and nonidentical structures in the proteins.

25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket <b>to</b> <b>substrate,</b> a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E
25|$|When P. exigua catch prey, {{they return}} to the nest with a solid, usually glossy mass, held in their mouthparts. If the size of prey is {{relatively}} large, the wasp may hold the crop with its anterior legs. Wasps were reported to share this food with other adults and offer the protein in a macerated form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth was white and larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This new layer remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E

2500|$|Catalytic {{amounts of}} {{hydrogen}} bond donors can promote reactions {{through a variety}} of different mechanisms. During the course of a reaction, hydrogen bonding can be used to stabilize anionic intermediates and transition states. Alternatively, some catalysts can bind small anions, enabling the formation of reactive electrophilic cations. More acidic donors can act as general or specific acids, which activate electrophiles by protonation. A powerful approach is the simultaneous activation of both partners in a reaction, e.g. nucleophile and electrophile, termed [...] "bifunctional catalysis". In all cases, the close association of the catalyst molecule <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> also makes hydrogen bond catalysis a powerful method of inducing enantioselectivity.|$|E

2500|$|By {{using an}} SBP, TRAP {{transporters}} share some similarity to ABC transporters {{in that the}} substrate for the transporter is initially recognized outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, the SBP is usually free in the periplasm and expressed at relatively high levels compared to the membrane domains. In Gram positive bacteria and archaea, the SBP is tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane. In both types of systems the SBP binds <b>to</b> <b>substrate,</b> usually with low micromolar affinity, which causes a significant conformation change in the protein, akin to a Venus flytrap closing. The trapped subtrate is then delivered to the membrane domains of the transporter, where the electrochemical ion gradient is somehow exploited to open the SBP, extract the substrate and catalyse its movement across the membrane. For the SiaPQM TRAP transporter which has been studied in a fully reconstituted in vitro form, uptake uses a [...] gradient and not proton gradient to drive uptake. The SiaPQM systems also exhibits unique properties for a secondary transporter in that it cannot catalyse bidirectional transport as the SBP imposes that movement {{is only in the}} direction of uptake into the cell.|$|E
