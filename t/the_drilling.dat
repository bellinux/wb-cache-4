5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> process.|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} whether {{considering the}} lateral inertia or not, aiming at the longitudinal vibration of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string in drilling progress, is proposed. In {{the light of}} the actual condition, the mechanical model of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string about vibration is established {{on the basis of the}} theoretical analysis. Longitudinal vibration equation of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string is derived from the Rayleigh-Love model and one-dimensional viscoelastic model. According to the Laplace transform method and the relationships among parameters of the model, the solutions to complex impedance at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string are obtained, and then the comparison results are analyzed, which is the lateral inertia effect on longitudinal vibration characteristics. The researches show that the smaller the length of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string, <b>the</b> greater the cross-sectional area of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string, <b>the</b> greater the damping coefficient of bottom hole on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string, and <b>the</b> more evident the effect on the dynamic stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string with lateral inertia effect. The Poisson ratio of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string only has some effects on it taking account of the lateral inertia effect, and the influence is relatively small compared with the former three conditions...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> {{project has}} been opposed by some {{environmental}} groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact.

5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war.

30|$|A {{variety of}} methods {{have been used to}} {{transmit}} signals from the ground to the equipment in the bottom hole assembly. At 90  years, some scientists have proposed to carry out underground operations by controlling the change in the rotational rate of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. Using <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe rotation rate {{as the basis for the}} transfer command, the sensor connected to <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe can measure the rotation rate of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. <b>The</b> rotation axis of the sensor is coincident with the rotation axis of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. When <b>the</b> rotational speed increases, the centrifugal force increases, in the role of centrifugal force sensor in the radial extension. Whereas a decrease in the rate of rotation of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe will cause the sensor to retract, that is, <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe rotation rate may be indirectly expressed as a radial expansion of the sensor. Using a sensor, a spring, and an excitation source, the instrument can perform command transfer based on drill string rotation rate changes. The mechanical structure of the entire sensor and excitation system is very complex and can only measure the change in the rate of rotation of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. It cannot measure the increase in the angle of rotation of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. This method may cause large errors in the signal transmission when <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string is rotated at a low rate due to the centrifugal force acting on <b>the</b> sensor in <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> inclined shaft.|$|R

5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit by <b>the</b> fluting of <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit. <b>The</b> cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> slightly or totally from <b>the</b> hole while <b>drilling).</b> Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit in <b>the</b> process of <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> is pushing <b>the</b> metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit, with a lubricant pumped to <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit.|$|R

40|$|Animals {{are confronted}} with {{potential}} stressors at zoos compared to in the wild, such as visitors and lack of environmental stimulation. This study included two projects conducted on <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna where I investigated: 1) the effect of visual barriers on the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and if <b>the</b> visual barriers can moderate the visitor effect on <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and 2) how outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment (frozen fruit and tube feeders) affects the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills.</b> 1 / 0 - sampling method was used when observing the behaviours of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> with 1 minute-intervals. Resting/Sleeping increased, while social agonistic behaviour and stereotypies decreased with visual barriers. A moderated visitor effect was shown in resting/sleeping and social affiliative behaviour in <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> with visual barriers. However, social agonistic behaviour and visitor interaction were still affected by visitors after {{the installation of the}} visual barriers, implying that <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> still find visitors stressful to some extent and that further alterations on the observation area viewing the indoor enclosure is recommended for the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>drills.</b> With outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment, locomotion, foraging/eating and body-shaking increased, while resting/sleeping, social affiliative and agonistic behaviour, stereotypies, visitor interaction, scratching and self-grooming decreased. This suggests that outdoor-only access and feeding enrichment improve the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and would be a valid option during summer season for <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> at Parken Zoo. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> {{subsidiary}} of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm.
