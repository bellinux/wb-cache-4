These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> more cautiously than larger firms.

A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, <b>technological</b> <b>change</b> clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of <b>technological</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{a system}} with n input factors there are n − 1 {{independent}} cost shares. An often-used approach in estimating factor demand systems is to (implicitly or explicitly) assume {{that there is a}} (independent) cointegrating relationship for each of the n − 1 independent cost shares. However, due to <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> there might not be as many cointegrating relationships as there are (independent) cost shares. The paper presents a flexible demand system that allows for both factor neutral <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> as well as <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> that affect the relative use of the different factors. The empirical tests indicate that there are fewer cointegrating relationships than usually implied by using conventional estimation approaches. This result is consistent with <b>technological</b> <b>changes.</b> I argue that since such unexplained <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> are likely to affect input factor decisions, a demand system that allows for such changes should be preferred...|$|R

This combined with increased literacy and print to allow the creation of new songs that initially built on, but began to differ from traditional music as composers like Lionel Monckton and Sidney Jones created music that reflected new social circumstances.|$|E

40|$|D. Phil. (Sociology) In {{this thesis}} I am {{examining}} the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and Solidarity‘s responses to <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> at the ArcelorMittal (formerly known as Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (Iscor)) Vanderbijlpark Plant {{in the south}} of the Gauteng province between 1989 and 2012. As part of the restructuring plans of the Apartheid government, Iscor South Africa was privatised in 1989. At that time the plant was also in a process of restructuring, which included <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> and work reorganisation, the objective of which was to prepare Iscor South Africa and the plant for competing in a global steel market. Therefore the subsequent <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> in the plant were also part of the plant‘s positioning in the global competition of the steel market. The ownership of the plant by ArcelorMittal International after 2006 meant that the plant was fully integrated into the global steel market because it became part of the other global plants of the ArcelorMittal International Group {{in other parts of the}} world. <b>Technological</b> <b>changes</b> and work reorganisation led to a massive displacement of workers at Iscor South Africa. For example, in 1988, Iscor had about 59 000 employees and this number was reduced to about 9 300 employees in 2010. The key objective of the thesis is to conduct a sociological analysis of trade union responses to the <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> at ArcelorMittal Vanderbijlpark Plant. One of the discoveries of this thesis is that both trade unions – Solidarity and NUMSA- were not proactive in responding to <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> at the plant. They argued for more consultation on <b>technological</b> <b>changes,</b> training, and deployment of workers who had been displaced by machines, work reorganisation, and retrenchment packages for retrenched workers. Solidarity, a predominantly white workers‘ union, with its skilled workforce did not use its membership‘s strategic location at the point of production to help it proactively to respond to <b>technological</b> <b>changes.</b> On the other hand, NUMSA, a predominantly black union which was part of a vibrant antiapartheid movement with traditions of grooming worker intellectuals, did not respond proactively to <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> at the plant. Even after the wave of restructuring and <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> of the 1990 s to early 2000 s, both unions did not move away from a reactive approach towards a proactive approach to production technology. The two unions did not combine reproduction and production issues in their bargaining strategies. The unions were still focusing on wages or reproduction as a strategy of engaging factory owners. Production in the form of <b>technological</b> <b>changes</b> and work reorganisation was not being addressed by the union and yet changes in production processes play a major role in determining the number of workers in a plant and the profile of the workforce as shown in this thesis. The reactive responses of both trade unions and a focus on wages is theorised as reproduction reductionism. This means that unions tend to focus on wages and other spheres of income such as politics of ‗upward mobility‘ which play a central role in reproducing workers and their leaders. The focus on these issues means that the unions are prioritising reproduction over production. This then leads to management of the plant having free reign in the sphere of production and <b>technological</b> <b>changes...</b>|$|R
