5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E
5|$|In an {{election}} held on September 19, 1995, {{the residents of}} King County voted against a 1-percentage-point sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> to fund {{the building of a}} replacement stadium. As a result, the ownership group set an October 30 deadline for local leadership {{to come up with a}} plan to finance a new stadium, or they would put the team up for sale.|$|E

5|$|Brown won acclaim {{from the}} {{railroad}} companies for vetoing a proposed railroad <b>tax</b> <b>increase,</b> but soon drew their ire for preventing {{the merger of}} the state's two largest railways, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The Mason and Foard Company, which leased convict labor to build railroads, resented Brown's prison reforms. Brown accused his predecessor, Simon Bolivar Buckner, of illegally allowing Mason and Foard to use convict labor, a charge Buckner vehemently denied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas <b>tax</b> <b>increase,</b> a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

Larger <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> were associated with larger declines in consumption. Raising state cigarette taxes {{appears to be an}} effective public health intervention that can reduce cigarette consumption and its associated health consequences...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} opinion on tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> in Germany. Design Ten wave {{cross-sectional}} study with assessments {{before and after}} the <b>tax</b> <b>increases.</b> Setting General population of Germany. Participants Ten representative samples from general population with a total number of 27, 608 persons aged 14 and above were interviewed. Main outcome measures Opinion ("support", "disapprove", and "undetermined") before and after tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increases.</b> Results Thirty-nine percent of the sample supported the tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increases.</b> Support was higher among non-smokers and subjects with higher levels of education. Data indicated an increase of support over time from 35 % in 2002 to 42 % in 2005 which was not affected by the amount of price increase. Conclusions The preliminary findings, that the amount of price increase did not affect the support of the general population in a negative way, and that support grew during a succession of <b>tax</b> <b>increases,</b> might be useful for legislators. ...|$|R

5|$|Off the field, the Mariners' AL West {{championship}} {{as well as}} its memorable run in {{the postseason}} served as a catalyst for public funding for a new ballpark. Less than two weeks before the tiebreaker, the residents of King County, Washington (whose county seat is Seattle) voted against a sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> to fund a new stadium, but shortly after their ALDS victory, the Washington State Legislature reconvened and approved a separate funding package for a new stadium. The new stadium, now called Safeco Field, opened in July 1999.|$|E
5|$|Ohio had {{completed}} the stretch of highway between I-70 to just before the SR7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel <b>tax</b> <b>increase,</b> Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model {{to provide}} {{estimates}} of the cumulative magnitude and distributional impact in 1993 of the <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> introduced by the NDP government in Ontario in their three budgets after coming to office in 1990. It finds that the Ontario NDP <b>tax</b> changes have <b>increased</b> the <b>tax</b> burden on the Ontario household sector by almost $ 3 billion and have raised the average taxes paid by an Ontario family by $ 663. The <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> are progressive up the income scale. Upper income families earning over $ 150, 000 bear the heaviest <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> of $ 6, 811 per family.

5|$|Prior to the {{cessation}} of passenger-only service in 2003, the state legislature passed a bill allowing non-state entities to operate their own public or private ferries near Washington State Ferries routes. Kitsap Transit, a public transit agency serving Kitsap County with bus service, decided to place a 0.3 percent sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> and motor vehicle excise tax on the November 2003 ballot to fund a passenger-only ferry service to replace the state-run ferries. The ballot measure was rejected by 61 percent of voters, with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel <b>tax</b> <b>increase,</b> Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction on the freeway. The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction. On average, between 25,500 and 37,840vehicles use the highway daily.|$|E

5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase.</b> Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US12 to one adjacent to I-94. Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow {{was used for the}} lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction. Also in 1972, a gas <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan. By late 1977, the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing <b>tax</b> <b>increase,</b> but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E

5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|One of the hardest-hit counties, Curry County, {{introduced}} a ballot measure {{to add a}} 3% sales tax to pay for county services. Oregon {{is one of only}} five states in the United States with no county or state sales tax, and the tax has been voted down regularly by voters whenever it has been proposed (though some areas assess a gas tax, and two cities in tourist areas, Ashland and Yachats, assess a local tax on prepared food). In Josephine County, after a proposed property <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> to pay for law enforcement was defeated in May 2012, the sheriff's office reduced its staff by 2/3 and released inmates from the county jail to reduce spending. Lane County released 96 prisoners from its prisons and laid off 40 law enforcement personnel to cut costs.|$|E
