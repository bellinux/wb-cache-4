Beginning in October 2005, it was one of only two ABC affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone to air ABC's World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>at</b> 7 p.m.; WSB-TV in Atlanta is the other. However, WSET has returned the national program to the 6:30p.m. time slot, shifting its local newscast to 7:00p.m.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{and like}} its major competitors, WABC aired {{an hour of}} local news at 6:00p.m. and {{followed}} it with the national newscast, in this case World News <b>Tonight,</b> <b>at</b> 7:00p.m.. For the 1986–87 season, WABC added another new syndicated offering in a revival of Hollywood Squares, which was placed at 7:30p.m. Squares {{turned out to be}} a strong performer against the immensely popular Wheel of Fortune on WCBS and, seeing these ratings, WABC decided that it could draw equal or better ratings with Jeopardy! in the 7:00 p.m slot. ABC did not require its stations to air its national broadcast at a specific time, giving WABC the freedom to make the move if it wanted.|$|E
