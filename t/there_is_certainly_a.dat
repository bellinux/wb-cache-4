25|$|The {{most famous}} Parthian art {{work is the}} bronze statue of a local prince found in the Iranian {{province}} of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in {{the remains of a}} small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince is standing in Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and a mustache. He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small. Daniel Schlumberger remarks that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, {{as can be seen in}} the details of the costume. An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be Surenas. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate about the place of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.|$|E
2500|$|Ernst Steinmann (d. 1934) {{detected}} in the later Madonna's a [...] "deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's physiognomy", which he attributed to [...] Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating {{of some of these}} Madonnas. [...] More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.|$|E
2500|$|Dean Angelo, {{president}} of the Chicago chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, said on the subject: [...] "I know there are people on the job for 9 or 10 years {{who have not been}} trained. I can't say they have all requested training, but I am sure some have. It's very hard to get the proper training as a Chicago police officer and that's something that {{has been going on for}} a very long time. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> percentage of my members who believe that the Chicago Police Department doesn't offer the same level of training, or the same opportunities to obtain training, as many other police departments in the country. I think the general attitude is that's just 'Welcome to the Chicago Police Department.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} in part {{inspired}} by an incident in 2000 in which a Korean mortician working for the U.S. military in Seoul dumped {{a large amount of}} formaldehyde down the drain. In addition to its environmental concerns, this caused some antagonism toward the United States. The American military stationed in South Korea is portrayed as uncaring about the effects their activities have on the locals. The chemical agent used by the American military to combat the monster in the end, named [...] "Agent Yellow" [...] in a thinly-veiled reference to Agent Orange, was also used to satirical effect. The director, Bong Joon-ho, commented on the issue: [...] "It's a stretch to simplify The Host as an anti-American film, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> metaphor and political commentary about the U.S." ...|$|E
2500|$|The spell {{itself and}} its {{consequences}} are certainly less easy to work out effectively than {{was the case with}} the famous spell in The Sorcerer.... After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to be in our judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. [...] But there is almost too much of it, and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their status quo, is very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. [...] The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. [...] This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.|$|E

5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> large {{migration}} {{of people from}} Central Europe westwards during the early Iron Age.

50|$|Wells Cathedral School is {{supposed}} to be the fifth oldest independent school in the country.

"Well, I {{think that}} that is the best thing that you can do, Paolo. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> danger in leaving it in anyone's hands, for when you return to claim it, perhaps some years hence, you might find that he was dead, or the place might be {{captured}} and burned down.

5000|$|Apparent horizons {{depend on}} the [...] "slicing" [...] of a spacetime.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{will grant}} you a slight blemish is {{beginning}} to appear, in that particular. It is a failing incidental to humanity, and we must not expect perfection. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> slight disposition to legislate for numbers, {{in order to obtain}} support at the polls, which has made the relation of debtor and creditor a little insecure, possibly; but prudence can easily get along with that. It is erring on the right side, is it not, to favour the poor instead of the rich, if either is to be preferred?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> very keen {{appetite}} in curiosity; it cannot {{stay for}} satisfaction, it is pressing for its necessary repast, and is without all patience: hunger and thirst are not appetites more vehement and more hard {{and difficult to}} be repressed than that of curiosity; nothing but the present now is able to allay it. A more expressive picture of this I never beheld than {{in the faces of}} some, and the murmurs and complaints of others, in that little inquisitive company, when the unwelcome note was given about signifying an adjournment for only twenty-four hours.|$|E

"Early {{travelers}} in Persia and India {{have reported}} things they saw far surpassing any {{we have witnessed}} this evening, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> sect in India at present, or rather a body of men, and those, as far as I {{have been able to}} learn, of an exceptionally intelligent class, who believe that they possess an almost absolute mastery over the powers of nature. You see, fifty years back, if anyone had talked about traveling at fifty miles an hour, or sending a message five thousand miles in a minute, he would have been regarded as a madman. There may yet be other discoveries as startling to be made.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal}} of {{activity}} in the skies over Whitton {{during the early years}} of the war with the sound of air raid sirens and anti-aircraft guns very common by both day and night.

60|$|In a flash the consul {{recalled}} {{the one or}} two questions that Gray had asked him, and saw it all. For an instant he felt the whole bitterness of Gray's misplaced generosity--its exposure and defeat. He glanced again hopelessly at Ailsa.
