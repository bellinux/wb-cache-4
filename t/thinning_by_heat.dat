40|$|Lowering the {{temperature}} of crystallization <b>by</b> deposition of <b>thin</b> films on a heated substrate represents {{the easiest way to}} find new means to develop and improve new working devices based on nanocrystals embedded in thin films. The improvements are strongly related with the increasing of operation speed, substantially decreasing the energy consumption and reducing unit fabrication costs of the respective semiconductor devices. This approach avoids major problems, such as those related to diffusion or difficulties in controlling of nanocrystallites size, which appear during thermal treatments at high temperatures after deposition.

In the pathogenetic experiment, all animals were kept at a temperature of 20 +/- 3 degrees C and treated for 30 consecutive days with D. pruriens 6 or 30 cH, or ethanol vehicle, or no treatment. the experiments were performed blind. The statistical analysis used Bartlett's test, followed by ANOVA/Tuckey-Krammer or Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn. the results point {{to the existence of}} therapeutic effects, with inhibition of the itching, skin lesions and fur <b>thinning</b> produced <b>by</b> <b>heat,</b> more evident in later observations, with the 9 12, and 30 cH potencies (Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn; P = 0. 001). No changes were observed in the other parameters, such as open field activity and laterality of the itching. in the pathogenetic experiment, no changes were observed in any parameters examined. We conclude that the proposed experimental model demonstrates the therapeutic effect of D. pruriens, but not its pathogenetic effects.
