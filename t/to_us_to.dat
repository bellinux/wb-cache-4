25|$|As {{a supreme}} realist, Eakins {{appeared}} heavy and vulgar {{to a public}} that thought of art, and culture in general, largely {{in terms of a}} graceful sentimentality. Today he seems <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have recorded his fellow Americans with a perception that was often as tender as it was vigorous, and to have preserved for us the essence of an American life which, indeed, he did not idealize — because it seemed to him beautiful beyond the necessity of idealization.|$|E
25|$|The killings were sparked {{off when}} five Free State {{soldiers}} were killed by a booby trap bomb while searching a Republican dugout at the village of Knocknagoshel, County Kerry, on 6 March. The next day, the local Free State commander authorised the use of Republican prisoners to clear mined roads. Paddy Daly justified the measure as, 'the only alternative left <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> prevent the wholesale slaughter of our men'. National Army troops may have interpreted this as permission to take revenge on the Anti-Treaty side.|$|E
25|$|Without {{calling into}} {{question}} {{the value of the}} preceding analyses, the third interpretation, which comes from an Assumptionist systematic theologian, Fr. George Tavard (19222007), a Frenchman living in the United States, places the emphasis on the deeply Trinitarian inspiration of d’Alzon’s writings, articulated around themes and actions which champion the rights of God. This undeniable aspect does not appear <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> invalidate the others because, on the one hand, d’Alzon was influenced by the Christocentric thought of his day and because, on the other hand, Fr. Tavard speaks more on or about Fr. d’Alzon than from Fr. d’Alzon himself.|$|E

I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy.

25|$|Sharaf was in New York in May 1958 {{when his}} younger brother Sami, {{considered}} one of President Nasser's most trusted aides, arrived {{to assist in the}} resolution of the budding political crisis in Lebanon. Immediately upon his arrival at Idlewild Airport (since renamed JFK International Airport), Sami was approached with an invitation from the-then CIA Director Allen Dulles to be a guest of the agency while in New York. Sami politely declined the invitation and conveniently opted to stay at his elder brother's apartment instead. At the time Sharaf, first secretary at the Egyptian mission to the UN, was residing at 240 East 76th Street, New York. Sami was again in New York with his elder brother in September 1960, preparing for President Nasser's only visit <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> attend and deliver a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.|$|E

50|$|Jung {{concluded}} that, {{in addition}} to our Personal Unconscious, we each possess a deeper aspect of the unconscious. It was in identifying this second unconscious region that Jung’s model differentiated itself from Freud’s. Naming it the Collective Unconscious, Jung theorized that this region contained psychological elements not developed {{during the course of}} our own lives, but passed on through our common evolutionary history to all members of our species. There are shared, fundamental elements that make up the Collective Unconscious and generate a limiting framework around which our psychic material organizes. He referred to those as Archetypes. Archetypes are the fundamental elements of the collective unconscious. Jung, states that every human being is born with a psyche that expects to engage, influence, and to undergo certain life milestones. For instance, our psyches have evolved <b>to</b> expect <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be born, <b>to</b> expect <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have parents, <b>to</b> expect <b>us</b> <b>to</b> encounter particular types of other people and creatures with which we share the earth, <b>to</b> expect <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have children, and <b>to</b> expect <b>us</b> <b>to</b> eventually die. These fundamental psychological expectations have become embodied, Jung claimed, in a common set of basic tendencies in the unconscious that predispose <b>us</b> <b>to</b> generate particular ideas, concepts and imagery related to them. These tendencies are the Archetypes.|$|R

500|$|Despite its failure, the Chilembwe {{rebellion}} {{has since}} gained an important {{place in the}} modern Malawian cultural memory, with Chilembwe himself gaining [...] "iconic status." [...] The uprising had [...] "local notoriety" [...] {{in the years immediately}} after it, and former rebels were kept under police observation. Over the next three decades, anti-colonial activists idealised Chilembwe and began to see him as a semi-mythical figure. The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) of the 1940s and 1950s used him as a symbolic figurehead, partly because its president, James Chinyama, had a family connection to Filipo Chinyama, who had been believed to be an ally of Chilembwe's. When the NAC announced that it intended to mark 15 February annually as Chilembwe Day, colonial officials were scandalised. One wrote that to [...] "venerate the memory of the fanatic and blood thirsty Chilembwe seems <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be nothing less than a confession of violent intention." ...|$|E

[...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, {{because there has been}} a lot of speculation about me of late and about my position within the club."

500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot.

Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
