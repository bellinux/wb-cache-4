500|$|The {{video was}} shot on May 30, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus {{attributed}} {{this to the}} emotions in the song. Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them [...] "fun at the same time". Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. She gets the camera, and that's {{what it takes to make}} a great music video." [...] Cyrus commented that she felt the video was [...] "more honest than [...] song" [...] and that she was [...] "singing out to [...] that special person".|$|E

During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, I know something had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] Talking for the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's one thing you don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that she got into the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music. When asked what's the inspiration behind the song she stated, [...] "Oh love, love, love! And it’s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> something sexy over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albie Hecht foreshadowed {{the success}} of the series after {{watching}} the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival. In an article, Hecht told New York Times reporter Felicia R. Lee: [...] "They're just real: real brothers, real friends; it's all the stuff kids do when they're hanging out on the playground. The idea that you're watching a documentary is so much fun. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them into that fantasy of being a world-famous rock band, and that's the sauce that makes it work." [...] Lee also called both the film and television series, [...] "an ebullient mock documentary." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll {{stay in the}} punt," [...] said Dick. [...] "I'm not fond of {{crawling}} through soft mud. <b>Then,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> up some birds, they'll probably {{fly over}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea! yea! mayhap {{you lose}} it ... but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> up eight guineas ... and win. Whereupon {{you are just}} as you were before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well! I can {{but tell}} you part, my friend," [...] rejoined the other, [...] "yet 'tis passing simple. You begin with one golden guinea ... and lose it ... <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> up two and lose again...." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{put your}} candle {{on the top}} of the cabinet. You opened, and shut, one drawer after another, until you came to the drawer in which I had put my Diamond. You looked at the open drawer for a moment. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your hand in, and took the Diamond out." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{your hand}} in mine again, kissed me, [...] and we {{struggled}} to be together.

6000|$|... "No, {{you don't}} {{put it down}} until {{everything}} is in and well mixed. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it down, half a pint at a time, four times a day.

6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you how to eat the Cobhurst tart. You cut it down from top to bottom: then you lay the two {{sections}} on their rounded sides: then you get a lot more of jam, which I see you have on the side table, and you spread the cut surfaces with it: <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it together as it was before, and slice it along its shorter diameter. Good?" [...] said he; [...] "they are delicious." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>You</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> {{out your}} characters. Once all players have put out their characters, play begins.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a small auger hole, to put {{the handle}} into. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> the wood into the saw-horse, and saw off the ends, at a little {{distance}} from the hole, so that, when the handle is put in, {{it will be like}} a mallet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{begin with}} the toes, one at a time. You make your toes die. You will them to die. And if you've got the belief and the will your toes will die.

60|$|I {{was to have}} {{an early}} breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor, and this delayed me a little. It is {{troublesome}} to get into, and {{there is so much}} detail. First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers, and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of people; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels. Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate, and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on your sword; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your stove-pipe joints onto your arms, your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould. This is no time to dance. Well, a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Miss Mary, [...] "if it only fairly {{surrounds}} {{and covers}} it; but, <b>then,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a large flame into a tumbler, {{it makes the}} first instant, a great current of air, and so the choke damp might be blown out, and common air get in, and so keep the paper burning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't {{believe that}} note ever was bad!' I say. 'I told {{you when you}} charged me I didn't believe it. That is why I have {{made up my mind}} to give you notice, to go away from here. And if that note is bad <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> me in prison.' ...|$|R

"You {{take and}} split the bean, {{and cut the}} wart so as to get some blood, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the {{crossroads}} {{in the dark of}} the moon, and then you burn {{up the rest of the}} bean. You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why is {{everything}} raised up on big wooden legs?" [...] he said. [...] "You have the floor, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{everything you have}} upon a wooden quadruped. Why do you do it?" [...] The Vicar explained with philosophical vagueness. The Angel burnt his finger in the candle-flame--and displayed an absolute ignorance of the elementary principles of combustion. He was merely charmed when a line of fire ran up the curtains. The Vicar had to deliver a lecture on fire so soon as the flame was extinguished. He {{had all kinds of}} explanations to make--even the soap needed explaining. It was an hour or more before the Angel was safely tucked in for the night.|$|E

When the gang gits wild I'll grab the girl an' pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an' whistle fer you.... But mebbe thet ain't so good.

50|$|If {{a player}} has a 10, they can place any card {{of the same}} suit down, but from then it must carry on in order.
