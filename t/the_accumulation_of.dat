5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream.

40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} some desirable algal strains for {{our future}} research and/or the production of algae-based biofuel, 43 green algal strains were successfully isolated from Chinese freshwaters, and then incubated in the laboratory bioreactors for the growth and oil accumulation investigations. During a 15 d incubation experiment, <b>the</b> <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> their biomass and total lipids, together with the lipid productivities for these green algal strains were systematically investigated and compared. Results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> biomass for <b>the</b> 43 algal strains ranged from 0. 53 g/L to 6. 07 g/L during the experiments, with the highest biomass of 6. 07 g/L for green algae Scenedesmus bijuga. The lipid content for the tested algal strains varied from 20 % to 51 % of the dry biomass {{at the end of}} cultivation experiments. Green algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa {{was one of the best}} oil producers based on our investigations, with the total lipid content of 51 % of dry biomass.

5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> {{wealth and}} resources, such as food, {{led to the}} need for defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through <b>the</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. <b>The</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
