40|$|The {{presence}} of "free" trimethylaluminum (TMA) in methylalumoxane (MAO) solutions {{can be highly}} detrimental {{to the performance of}} metallocene and "post-metallocene" olefin polymerization catalysts. The most used strategy to remove "free" TMA is <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> MAO solutions <b>to</b> <b>dryness,</b> until a free-flowing white powder ("solid MAO") is left. This procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous, because in some cases the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA. Moreover, "solid MAO" is poorly soluble in common polymerization media, and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent. This communication reports on a facile alternative, which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol, such as 2, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol, effectively trapping "free" TMA. We show here that 2, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol/MAO solutions activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well-known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine) Ti catalysts, and that their use in propene polymerization results in a substantially higher productivity, polymer stereoregularity, and/or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{temperature and}} precipitation regime encountered {{over the life}} cycle of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) affects populations. Caged populations of A. albopictus were maintained at 22, 26, and 30 degreesC. Cages were equipped with containers that served as sites for oviposition and larval development. All cages were assigned to one of three simulated precipitation regimes: (1) low fluctuation regime - water within the containers was allowed <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> <b>to</b> 90 % of its maximum before being refilled, (2) high fluctuation regime - water was allowed <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> <b>to</b> 25 % of its maximum before being refilled, and (3) drying regime - water was allowed <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> <b>to</b> complete container <b>dryness</b> before being refilled. Greater temperature and the absence of drying resulted in greater production of adults. Greater temperature in combination with drying were detrimental to adult production. These precipitation effects on adult production were absent at 22 C. Greater temperatures and drying treatments yielded higher and lower eclosion rates, respectively and, both yielded greater mortality. Development time and size of adults decreased with increased temperatures, and drying produced larger adults. Greater temperatures resulted in greater egg mortality. These results suggest that populations occurring in warmer regions are likely to produce more adults as long as containers do not dry completely. Populations in cooler regions are likely to produce fewer adults with the variability of precipitation contributing less to variation in adult production. Predicted climate change in North America is likely to extend the northern distribution of A. albopictus and to limit further its establishment in arid regions...|$|R
