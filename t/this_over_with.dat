5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

I had a great iron pan, in which I boiled the bones to make skeletons, and at night I covered <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> boards, and put heavy stones upon it; but the dogs managed to remove these and carried away the greater part of one of my specimens.

In our talks we agree that we, your betters, constantly find you forgetting that we are your betters. Your answer is that the war and other happenings have shown you that age is not necessarily another name for sapience; that our avoidance of frankness in life and in the arts is often, but not so often as you think, a cowardly way of shirking unpalatable truths, and that you have taken us off our pedestals because we look more natural on the ground. You who are at the rash age even accuse your elders, sometimes not without justification, of being more rash than yourselves. 'If Youth but only knew,' we used to teach you to sing; but now, just because Youth has been to the war, it wants to change the next line into 'If Age had only to do.' ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{just knew}} {{this is where}} I belonged.

So I went on his request and stayed for a week in a Benedictine monastery not far from London ... I had a wonderful time staying with the Benedictines, this is the Abbey in Sussex, while they were saying their morning rosary, I was chanting Krishna on my beads and I took long walks with most monks in the community, and talked over my decision and told them that I really feel that God is calling me to do this. At end of a week, the Abbot of the monastery heard that I was planning {{to go back to the}} temple, to join the Krishna temple, so he asked to see me. I went to see him and he said that [...] "some of the monks, a few of them have come to me and suggested that Richard is going to join Krishna temple, we would like to have prayer vigil through the night to pray for his soul because, we're worried." [...] And the Abbot said, [...] "I told them, there's no need to worry, because he's doing the right thing," [...] and he told me, [...] "If I was your age, I'd do the same." [...] So I never felt any conflict at all between, because ultimately the important thing Jesus Christ was teaching us was to love God - by loving God you can love one another, and that's exactly the same that Krishna teaches. There's no need to be any conflict whatsoever, in my mind.|$|E
40|$|The Space Race {{during the}} Cold War was {{an era when}} the World saw great {{possibilities}} and scientific discoveries. Before 1957, the thing we call space had never been scaled by man. The Soviet Union turned <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> Sputnik 1, the very first artificial satellite which would change our way to research everything beyond Earth. Although this is true, there is also another side of Space Race which has more or less {{nothing to do with}} space at all – the politics. There is no denying that the politics about Space Race was far more essential for the United States and the Soviet Union than any scientific research. Kennedy talked about prestige and to “be ahead” in the race for space. Of course, the Americans and the Russians were fully involved and knew what could be gained from winning the race. But what about other nations? What about the Swedes? This thesis brings the Space Race to Sweden and examines two Swedish newspapers to get a clear view on how the people of Sweden actually encountered Space Race. To narrow the thesis down, the author picked two important events where the political side of Space Race is distinct – Yuri Gagarin’s orbit of the Earth in 1961 and John Glenn’s orbit of the Earth in 1962. What kind of position in the Space Race did Sweden have, and how is it reflected in the newspapers? Does the political differences in two leading tabloids affect the outcome of the articles? And which kind of theories about the Cold War could be applied on these tabloids? This kind of research is uncommon to encounter in Sweden, but it ought to be dealt with here...|$|E
