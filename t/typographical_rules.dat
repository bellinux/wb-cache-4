2500|$|The {{general rule}} of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is that the {{numerical}} value always precedes the unit, and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number, [...] (not [...] "" [...] or [...] ""). Thus {{the value of the}} quantity is the product of the number and the unit, the space being regarded as a multiplication sign (just as a space between units implies multiplication). The only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree, minute, and second for plane angle (°, ′, and ″, respectively), for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol. Other languages, and various publishing houses, may follow different <b>typographical</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

From its first 203-page edition, the CMOS evolved into a comprehensive reference style guide of 1,026 pages in its sixteenth edition. It {{was one of the first}} editorial style guides published in the United States, and it is largely responsible for research methodology standardization, notably citation style.|$|E

However, despite {{the existence of}} a well-established tradition in scientific writing in Catalan, dating back to 1273 in the writings of Ramon Llull, and despite the early introduction of the Gutenberg printing press in Catalonia, where the first printed book in Catalan appeared in 1474, there are not yet any standard encompassing typographical conventions for scientific writing. <b>Typographical</b> <b>rules</b> are proposed in this paper which reflect the spirit found in ancient Catalan scientific writings while conforming to modern typographical conventions. Some of these <b>typographical</b> <b>rules</b> are realized as a set of TEX definitions, and they are meant to be incorporated in Catalan extensions of TEX andLATEX. In addition, the proposal is also expected to {{contribute to the development of}} standard rules for scientific writing in Catalan...|$|E

Formal quality of the documents is very important as it contributes to better understanding and information transmission. The paper deals with the automated documents quality evaluation. This requires a design of a document model. The model contains the objects of which the pages are compiled, the types of objects and, the most important, the objects’ parameters. The parameters of the object are very important as they are inputs for the document evaluation according to the <b>typographical</b> <b>rules.</b> The parameters {{are an important part}} of the model which should reliably describe the document. A set of criteria is designed, which are used to describe the requirements on appropriate methods for model formation. From large amount of methods, methods that meet the criteria can be applied to the document. The result is a model of a real document which can be used for the automatic evaluation based on the <b>typographical</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|E

This bachelor thesis deals {{with the creation of}} a web application that will allow a preparation of a card corresponding to the proper <b>typographical</b> <b>rules.</b> The output of this application is a PDF file, which contains the user designed business cards and the crop marks, and is thus ready to print and cut into individual cards...|$|E

The primal specification of actual possibilities and the best web typography practice, which are the basis for the analysed <b>typographical</b> <b>rules,</b> is followed by the analysis itself using appropriate methodology. By comparing the gained results and best practice the fields that may be improved from the typographical point of view are determined...|$|E

Its aim is to map errors in written expression in the topics of spelling lexicography, morphology and syntactics. In addition it is focused on analysing {{the extent to which}} <b>typographical</b> <b>rules</b> are disregarded. These problems were investigated by analysis of the inserted statuses and comments by the members of the selected and specified groups of Facebook. In my research, I found {{that a large number of}} the authors made elementary mistakes in spelling that are taught in the first grade of the primary school. Another important discovery is that many users hold the opinion that observing the grammatical rules is less of a priority than the content of their communication...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. magyar. ldf, the Hungarian Babel module {{was rewritten}} {{in the autumn}} of 2003 to obey most of the Hungarian <b>typographical</b> <b>rules.</b> This article {{describes}} some implementation issues, TEX macro programming hacks and L ATEX typesetting trickery used in magyar. ldf. All features of the new magyar. ldf are enumerated, but only those having an interesting implementation are presented in detail. Most of the tricks shown are useful for developing other language modules. 1 The name of the language Usually a Babel language module has the English name of that language. For example, the German module is called germanb. ldf, and not deutsch. ldf. The Hungarian module is an exception to this rule, because it has the name magyar. ldf, in which “magyar ” is the Hungarian adjective meaning Hungarian. A similar exception is portuges. ldf for Portuguese. The letter “a ” in word “magyar ” has to be pronounced as in “blah”, and the consonant “gy ” is the same as “d ” in due. The name of a language that a Babel language module (. ldf file) defines i...|$|E
