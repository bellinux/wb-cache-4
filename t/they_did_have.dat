5|$|Other pirate radio {{stations}} in Britain were connected with the indie scene, with the most notable being Q102 and Radio Phoenix in London, and KFM Radio in Manchester. Playing indie rock, these stations broke bands such as Blur and The Happy Mondays. Although not as numerous as either the black or rave oriented stations, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> {{a significant impact on}} the music industry. The music journalist, Steve Lamacq broadcast on Q102, which later became XFM.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given equal footing with men, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E

5|$|Even {{cities and}} states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{had been}} unable to {{successfully}} pin-point the Canadian defensive positions, having failed to carry out a thorough reconnaissance prior to the attack. The severe terrain had also prevented the assaulting troops from adopting a low profile during their final assault, however in the darkness the Canadian rifle fire was ineffective, forcing them to resort to using grenades and rocket launchers. The Chinese mortars and artillery was particularly ineffective however, and very few rounds fell on the Canadian positions during the evening. Indeed, in their haste to follow up the collapse of the South Korean 6th Division, the Chinese 118th Division had left the bulk of its artillery and supplies well north of scene of the fighting. Meanwhile, what mortar ammunition <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> had been largely used up on the Australians during the previous evening. In contrast, the New Zealand gunners provided effective fire support and had been able to break up a number of Chinese assaults before they had even reached the Patricias. The Chinese now turned their attention to D Company holding the summit of Hill 677, on the battalion's left flank.|$|E

25|$|Over time, due {{to their}} community's {{isolation}} from those in Europe and the Middle East, the practices of the Beta Israel developed to differ significantly from those of other forms of Judaism.

25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> some reasonable doubts {{as to whether}} or not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew had only a few seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} Odo was {{defeated}} so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won 11 years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> {{never got a}} chance to mobilize. As Herman of Carinthia wrote in one of his translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

During the 1920s, Billy Gillespie set the Irish FAs record of thirteen goals in an international career, of which seven of these came {{at the expense of}} England. Gillespie's record was eventually equalled by Colin Clarke in 1992 and broken by David Healy in 2004, thus holding the record for nearly 80 years.|$|E
25|$|Ortiz {{would face}} Berto, whose first thrilling slugfest in April {{was one of}} the best fights of the year, once again. The fight, which had been in {{discussion}} for weeks, was originally supposed to take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on February 11, 2012. The fight was postponed to June 30, 2012, due to Berto rupturing his biceps in training and being unable to meet the original date. On May 20, 2012, Berto failed an anti-doping test, testing positive for nandrolone. Although Berto denied having ever taken the substance intentionally, the rematch was cancelled and Light Welterweight Josesito Lopez was chosen to take his place. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a rematch eventually, in 2016.|$|E
25|$|When the revolts began, Reynolds {{was asleep}} in her home in San Juan. At 2 A.M. she was awakened when more than forty armed policemen and National Guardsmen showed up at her doorstep. Even though {{they did not have}} a search warrant they {{proceeded}} to search the house, and confiscated her papers and speeches. When she asked them if they had a search warrant they answered that they didn't but that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> an order to arrest her. The police claimed that their actions were justified under the provisions of the Gag Law (Law 53) of Puerto Rico, known as the Ley de la Mordaza. Reynolds was taken into custody along with Carmen María Pérez Roque and Olga Viscal Garriga. She was held for various days at police headquarters before she was transferred to La Princesa Prison.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of generation identity on the reminiscence bump {{can be attributed}} to the idea that all members of the subgroup are likely to have memories of similar types of experiences. Evidence attesting to the {{influence of}} generation identity on the reminiscence bump has been witnessed in populations that have experience with traumatic events. In 1999, researchers compared younger and older groups of Bangladeshis. The younger group (ages 20–42) showed the usual increase in memories during the reminiscence bump while the older group (ages 46–86) showed a second increase in memories between the ages of 35 and 55. The second bump experienced by the older group corresponded to the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The two generations showed similar patterns and timing of memory recall within their own subgroup, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> similar experiences, either living or not living through the war. This finding may suggests that each generation remember personal events and generational events.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|The team {{wanted to}} capture the aspect of BioShock where not every non-player {{character}} would immediately be aggressive towards you; Levine discusses a situation in Infinite where the player character walks into a crowded bar and cannot immediately tell the disposition of the non-player characters towards the player. Levine compared this {{to the introduction of}} the Big Daddy in BioShock, giving the player several opportunities to view but not engage the characters so they would understand that there are several possible outcomes depending on what approach they used when <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the ability to engage one. As Infinite contains numerous groups in internal conflict with each other, the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} learn how to utilize different non-player character agents to progress in the game. Irrational wanted to make sure consequences of the player's actions were reflected in the game; part of this is through the strain on Elizabeth when using her powers, but through altering the suspended city, they are able to change the environment in response to the player's choice and force the player to consider different tactics.|$|E
