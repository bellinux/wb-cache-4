5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi.

Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} linear tapered waveguide. Voltage-standing-wave-ratio (VSWR) is obtained from <b>transmission</b> matrix <b>of</b> the taper waveguide.

One is of the initial length <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> line, second one is due to discontinuity and third one is of the final length <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> line. <b>Transmission</b> matrix <b>of</b> discontinuity is obtained by two methods. One is by equivalent circuit of step discontinuity and another is by moment method. The results are seen to be in good agreement with [1, 2] and [3]. 1...|$|R
