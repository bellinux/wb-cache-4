5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many English dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional varieties <b>that</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> {{each other in}} terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE). There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains <b>that</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, {{plants have}} alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in}} the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties <b>that</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, {{it may even}} give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Saving Mr. Banks depicts several events <b>that</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> {{recorded}} accounts. The {{premise of}} the script—that Walt Disney had to convince P.L. Travers {{to hand over the}} film rights, including the scene when he finally persuades her—is fictionalized, as Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when Travers arrived to consult with the Disney staff. Disney, in fact, left Burbank to vacation in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. Therefore, many of the dialogue scenes between Travers and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although Travers was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles.|$|E
