25|$|In 1998, Afghan-American {{telecommunications}} entrepreneur Ehsan Bayat won {{an exclusive}} license from Afghanistan's Taliban government to create Afghan Wireless as {{a joint venture}} with the country's Ministry of Communications, which owns 20% of the company. Bayat received financial backing from British entrepreneurs Stuart Bentham and Lord Michael Cecil. Within a year, Afghan Wireless had re-enabled Afghanistan's international country calling code and set up computerized telephone exchanges in the cities of Kabul and Kandahar replacing the outdated manual <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards</b> that the country's telecommunications had long relied upon.|$|E

They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop calculators, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer ANITA Mk VII of 1961 and even the first electronic <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards.</b> Later alphanumeric versions in fourteen segment display format found use in airport arrival/departure signs and stock ticker displays. Some elevators used Nixies to display floor numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards.</b> It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton covered hose, with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an ozone-friendly clean agent and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|E

50|$|Telephone {{lines were}} now being built {{all across the}} town of Bathurst to link one branch of a {{business}} with another or a government office with another related office. The problem was {{that none of the}} telephones could interconnect with another business. In the early 1890s the local business chamber of commerce commenced lobbying the Post & Telegraph Department to establish a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> in Bathurst. The Government required a minimum of 15 subscribers to sign up before the switchboard would be installed. The cost to have a switchboard connection was ₤5 per annum. In 1896 the Government agreed and installed a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard.</b>|$|R
