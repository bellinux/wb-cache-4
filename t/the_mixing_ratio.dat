5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio,</b> is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

25|$|The {{electronic}} phasing {{effect is}} created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an all-pass filter, which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are <b>mixed,</b> <b>the</b> frequencies {{that are out of}} phase will cancel each other out, creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> <b>ratio</b> changes <b>the</b> depth of the notches; the deepest notches occur when <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> <b>ratio</b> is 50%.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, astrobiologists Chris McKay and Heather Smith {{predicted}} that if methanogenic life is consuming atmospheric hydrogen in sufficient volume, {{it will have}} a measurable effect on <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio</b> in the troposphere of Titan.

25|$|In {{addition}} to hydrocarbons, the stratosphere contains carbon monoxide, {{as well as}} traces of water vapor and carbon dioxide. <b>The</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio</b> of carbon monoxide—3—is {{very similar to that}} of the hydrocarbons, while the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and water are about 10−11 and 8, respectively.

25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been known for some time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. <b>The</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio</b> is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E
