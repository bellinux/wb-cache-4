5|$|In the 1970s, Hanna-Barbera {{produced}} an animated series called The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan. Keye Luke, {{who had played}} Chan's son in many Chan films of the 1930s and '40s, lent his voice to Charlie, employing a much-expanded vocabulary. The series focused on Chan's children, played initially by East Asian-American child actors before being recast, due to concerns <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> viewers would not understand the accented voices. The title character bears some resemblance to the Warner Oland depiction of Charlie Chan. Leslie Kumamota voiced Chan's daughter Anne, before being replaced by Jodie Foster.|$|E

Furthermore, he argues that the development return of investing in young people is very high, and <b>that</b> <b>young</b> people have important characteristics and attributes that can add value to the development process. He argues that as a consequence, the development community needs to ensure <b>that</b> <b>young</b> people and their needs are being included in any development programs in order to alleviate the market failure and thus optimize the positive impact <b>that</b> <b>young</b> people can have on economic and social development.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} Western countries, the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E
5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E

40|$|The grandstanding theory posits <b>that</b> <b>young</b> {{venture capital}} firms (VCs) {{will seek to}} build their reputations by taking ventures public early. In this study, we examine this theory in the Japanese IPO market. With the {{introduction}} of MOTHERS and NASDAQ Japan in 1999 and 2000, respectively, with the explicit intent of catering to smaller and younger companies, {{we are able to}} examine the influence of these new markets on grandstanding and the IPO process. We find <b>that</b> <b>young</b> lead VC-backed ventures go public at a younger age than mature lead VC-backed ventures and <b>that</b> <b>young</b> lead VC-backed ventures are more underpriced. However, we do not find <b>that</b> <b>young</b> lead VCs have relatively lower equity stakes at IPO. This latter finding is most likely a result of the introduction of the new markets...|$|R
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> masters could compete for it.|$|E

The AIF was {{established}} as Australia's expeditionary force {{to fight in the}} war, as the Citizens' Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). He had first attempted to enlist under his true name and age, and had told the clerk he was married with a child. When told <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> unmarried men were volunteering in great numbers, and that his services would not be required, he merely joined a queue in front of a different clerk, gave the name Wilder and claimed he was a bachelor. With the rank of private he was allotted to the Queensland-raised 9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade, which was part of the 1st Division, and was given the regimental number 974. Within three weeks he had been promoted to lance corporal, and by late September was a corporal. The battalion embarked for overseas the following month and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt on the Themistocles, arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, Wilder was promoted to sergeant, and he was posted as the battalion orderly room sergeant.|$|E
