40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine how <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> affects <b>the</b> apparent depth and shape from shading. Experiment 1 showed {{that the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> affected perception of the apparent depth and shape. Too large or small highlight resulted in perceiving shaded circle as lower convex. Experiment 2 showed that <b>the</b> location of <b>highlight</b> affected <b>the</b> apparent depth of stimuli without shading, which is the same as stimuli with <b>highlight</b> and shading. <b>The</b> depth scale was the highest when <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> was located at a half of the diameter {{from the center of the}} circle, and the lowest when <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> was on <b>the</b> edge or in the center of the circle. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> is one of key factors to depth perceptio...|$|R

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E

She most recently composed and produced {{the majority of the}} score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E
5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
