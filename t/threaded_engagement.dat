A laminated disc between the cap and the neck forms a gas tight seal and the cap has a central opening that exposes a medial region of the disc. Piercing the disc through the opening are two electrodes, the inner ends of which contact the sample within the flask and the outer ends {{of which can be}} connected to test equipment. Cylindric glass tubes are fitted over the external portion of the electrodes to provide physical support and silicone rubber or a similar material serves to retain the glass cylinders in place and form a gas tight seal between the cylinders and the electrodes. Shrinkable tubing is shrunk over the glass tubes to afford further mechanical support and sealing. A final relatively large diameter shrinkable tube is shrunk over both electrodes and their associated glass cylinders. The support and sealing means for the electrodes is confined to a limited portion of the medial region of the disc so that the remainder of such region can be punctured by a hollow needle to introduce a test sample within the flask...|$|E

Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgical {{reconstruction}} of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be complicated by incorrect and variable tunnel placement, graft tunnel mismatch, cortical breaches, and inadequate fixation due to screw divergence. This is the first report describing {{the use of a}} C-arm with image intensifier employed {{for the sole purpose of}} eliminating those complications during trans-tibial ACL reconstruction. Purpose: To determine if the use of a C-arm with image intensifier during arthroscopically assisted transtibial ACL reconstruction (IIAA-TACLR) eliminated common complications associated with bone–patellar tendon–bone ACL reconstruction, including screw divergence, cortical breaches, graft-tunnel mismatch, and improper positioning of the femoral and tibial tunnels. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 110 consecutive patients (112 reconstructed knees) underwent identical IIAA-TACLR using a bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft performed by a single surgeon. Intra- and postoperative radiographic images and operative reports were evaluated for each patient looking for evidence of cortical breeching and screw divergence. Precision of femoral tunnel placement was evaluated using a sector map modified from Bernard et al. Graft recession distance and tibial a angles were recorded. Results: There were no femoral or tibial cortical breaches noted intraoperatively or on postoperative images. There were no instances of loss of fixation screw major <b>thread</b> <b>engagement.</b> There were no instances of graft-tunnel mismatch.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of the preload bolt is often an afterthought {{in the design of}} Langevin type “sandwich” transducers, but quite often it is the root cause of failure for power ultrasonic applications. The main role of the preload bolt is to provide a “prestress” in the piezo stack to prevent interface “gapping” or tension in glued joints which can result in delamination. But {{as an integral part of}} a highly tuned dynamic system, the resulting parasitic resonances in these preload bolts, such as bending or longitudinal modes, are often difficult to predict and control. This research investigates many aspects of preload bolt design for achieving optimal transducer performance, including basic size and strength determination based on drive amplitude, as well as ensuring adequate <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> to the mating horn. Other aspects such as rule-of-thumb configuration and length guidelines to reduce parasitic resonances are also investigated. Optimizing the uniformity of stress in the piezoceramics is also considered, which is affected by end mass length, counterbores and proximity to threading. The {{selection of}} the bolt material based on stiffness is also investigated as related to electromechanical coupling. The investigation focuses solely on Langevin type transducers used for semiconductor wire bonding, and which are comprised of the common Navy Types I and III (PZT 4 and PZT 8) piezoelectric materials. Several metrics are investigated such as impedance, displacement gain, and electromechanical coupling factor. The experimental and theoretical research methods include Bode plots, scanning laser vibrometry and finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{determine}} {{the length of}} <b>engagement</b> <b>threads</b> of a bolt installed in a tapped part {{in order to avoid}} the threads stripping remains a very current problem in the design of the thread assemblies. It does not exist a calculation method formalized for the cases where the bolt is screwed directly in a ductile material. In this article, we study the behavior of the threads stripping of a loaded assembly by using a modelling by finite elements and a rupture criterion by damage. This modelling enables us to study the different parameters likely to influence the behavior of this bolted connection. We study in particular, the influence of couple of materials constituting the connection, of the bolt’s diameter and the geometrical characteristics of the tapped part, like the external diameter and the length of <b>engagement</b> <b>threads.</b> We established an experiments design to know the most significant parameters. That enables us to propose a simple expression making possible to calculate the resistance of the threads whatever the metallic materials of the bolt and the tapped part. We carried out stripping tests in order to validate our model. The estimated results are very close to those obtained by the tests. Keywords—Bolt, damage, plasticity, stripping, thread assemblies.

40|$|Self-advancing tool bits {{that are}} hybrids of drills and stepped taps make it {{possible}} to form threaded holes wider than about 1 / 2 in. (about 13 mm) without applying any more axial force than is necessary for forming narrower pilot holes. These self-advancing stepped-tap drills were invented for use by space-suited astronauts performing repairs on reinforced carbon/carbon space-shuttle leading edges during space walks, in which the ability to apply axial drilling forces is severely limited. Self-advancing stepped-tap drills could also be used on Earth for making wide holes without applying large axial forces. A self-advancing stepped-tap drill (see figure) includes several sections having progressively larger diameters, typically in increments between 0. 030 and 0. 060 in. (between about 0. 8 and about 1. 5 mm). The tip section, which is the narrowest, is a pilot drill bit that typically has a diameter between 1 / 8 and 3 / 16 in. (between about 3. 2 and about 4. 8 mm). The length of the pilot-drill section is chosen, according to the thickness of the object to be drilled and tapped, so that the pilot hole is completed before engagement of the first tap section. Provided that the cutting-edge geometry of the drill bit is optimized for the material to be drilled, only a relatively small axial force [typically of the order of a few pounds (of the order of 10 newtons) ] must be applied during drilling of the pilot hole. Once the first tap section engages the pilot hole, it is no longer necessary for the drill operator to apply axial force: the <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> between the tap and the workpiece provides the axial force to advance the tool bit. Like the pilot-drill section, each tap section must be long enough to complete its hole before engagement of the next, slightly wider tap section. The precise values of the increments in diameter, the thread pitch, the rake angle of the tap cutting edge, and other geometric parameters of the tap sections must be chosen, in consideration of the workpiece material and thickness, to prevent stripping of threads during the drilling/tapping operation. A stop-lip or shoulder at the shank end of the widest tap section prevents further passage of the tool bit through the hole...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ultimate load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes of threaded steel fasteners subjected to various combinations of tension and shear loads at elevated deformation rates. Threaded steel fasteners are often used to assemble members and components in engineering structures, and the behaviour characteristics of each individual fastener can have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the total structure. Hence, before the response of a structure can be determined based on a given load scenario the behaviour of each of the involved components and joints must be known as well as the material behaviour at the deformation rates representative for the load situation. The work carried out in this thesis is presented in a synopsis, providing the background, the objectives, the strategy and a summary of the project. Then three individual papers/parts follow where two have been published in peer reviewed journals and the third has been submitted for potential journal publication. The first two papers are dealing with the tensile behaviour of threaded steel fasteners at elevated rates of strain. The objective was to investigate the ultimate tensile load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes. In the first paper, results and observation from the experimental study were presented, and the Alexander model was modified to consider the ultimate load and mode of failure at high loading rates. In the second paper, results from a numerical study were presented. The numerical study was based on the experimental results obtained from the first part. An axisymmetric finite element model was used to predict the tension behaviour characteristics and the failure modes of the threaded steel fasteners. Comparison of results between simulations and experiments showed that the axisymmetric finite element model captured the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with good accuracy. It was observed that the failure modes were influenced by the <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> length, the grip length and the strain-rate. The third paper explores the ultimate load and behaviour characteristics of threaded steel fasteners exposed to combined tension and shear load at elevated deformation rates. An experimental and a numerical study were conducted. In the experimental study, the loading angle was 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, where 0 ° corresponded to loading along the axis of the threaded steel fasteners. The numerical study was carried out using a three-dimensional finite element model. Simulations were performed at the same deformation rates as in the experiments, while the load was applied at different angles varying between 0 º and 90 º with 15 º intervals. Interaction curves were established based on both the experimental and the numerical results. The numerical model was found to capture the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with reasonable accuracy. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R

In this article the path from the earlier to the later writings is traced such that two surprising conclusions can be drawn: first, that Heidegger’s later thinking about art is powerfully pre-figured in the single reference to poetry in Being and Time; and, second, that Heidegger’s later thinking about art does not develop a new discourse on aesthetics but, rather, a discourse that re-visions our self-understanding by elaborating an essential tie—already stressed in Being and Time—between our Being and dwelling. The discussion of Heidegger’s philosophy of art as a philosophy of settlement is developed through a renewed assessment of Heidegger’s famous interpretation of Van Gogh’s picture {{of a pair of}} old shoes. It is argued that the picture plays a twin role in Heidegger’s analysis: drawing together the <b>threads</b> of Heidegger’s <b>engagement</b> with our time as belonging to the technological age, while also illustrating Heidegger’s conception of the creation of art not as the production of an object but as involved in the opening up of a world.

The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland.

The receiver further includes a <b>threaded</b> portion for <b>engagement</b> with the <b>threaded</b> portion of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland.
