40|$|Intense sport {{competition}} is {{typically associated with}} young people. Also, {{much of the literature}} on exercise for older adults focuses on benefits derived from regular physical activity, such as walking, dancing and fitness classes, and suggests that one should avoid extremely strenuous exercise. The rising phenomenon of older people competing in sport presents a challenge to these assumptions. In 2009, approximately 28, 000 athletes from 95 countries gathered in Sydney, Australia to compete across 28 different sports at the World Masters Games. We interviewed 44 competitors (23 females, 21 males; aged 56 - 90 years; M= 72) about what they gained from competing in sport that extended beyond non-competitive physical activity outcomes. Five key themes emerged from the data. The first theme, “I like a challenge”, depicts Masters sport as an ideal context to test one’s abilities. In particular, lifelong athletes (or those who had returned to sport after a long break) enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing they “can still do it”! On the other hand, Masters competitions provide space for older people to begin sport in later life, as the second theme highlights, “I discovered that at this age group I could win things”! Theme three, “I’m more motivated to work harder”, describes how regular competitions provided goals for participants which structured their training. Also, the act of competing brought out their best performances. The fourth theme, “You know where you stand”, shows how participants liked that competition enabled them to compare themselves with others of their own age cohort. The final theme, “Travel” and “companionship”, explains how the organized, competitive structure of Masters sport and its club system allowed for regular <b>travel,</b> the <b>establishment</b> of ongoing friendships and weekly social interaction.

40|$|Environmental {{change and}} {{anthropogenic}} activities influence species distributions. Species introductions {{have become increasingly}} common {{in an era of}} globalization and increased international trade and <b>travel.</b> The <b>establishment</b> of introduced species outside their native range and subsequent spread are of great conservation concern. Introduced species that become invasive, spread rapidly and reach high abundance, may cause the extinction of native species, disrupt ecosystem functioning and pose a threat to human health and the economy. It is therefore of great interest to understand the processes and mechanisms involved in species range expansion in order to develop effective management strategies. In this thesis I examine the influence of the landscape on species’ distribution and analyse patterns of range expansion of a non-native insect in south-central Sweden. Roesel’s bush-cricket (Metrioptera roeselii) was chosen as a model organism as its biology is well studied and its range expansion has been documented not only in Sweden but also in several other European countries. The aims of this thesis were (I) to identify landscape variables that predict the species distribution, (II) to estimate the rate of range expansion, (III) to identify the source of range expansion in south-central Sweden and to assess the dispersal pattern using population genetic data, and (IV) to analyse the influence of landscape composition and structure on population connectivity. I analysed species distribution, genetic and landscape data using a range of statistical modelling techniques in combination with geographic information systems (GIS). The results showed that the amounts of arable land, pasture and rural settlements as well as linear habitat elements are important predictors of the species’ distribution. During the last three decades, Metrioptera roeselii has expanded its range from the northern shores of the Lake Mälaren at an estimated rate of 0. 3 - 3. 16 km/year. The genetic diversity across the range was surprisingly high and degree of population differentiation was low to moderate likely due to frequent gene flow between populations in the centre of the species range and decreased gene flow towards the range margin. It appears the species establishes populations through infrequent long-distance and frequent short-distance dispersal (natural, human-mediated) ...|$|R

Literature review [...] Chapter 3. Methodology [...] Chapter 4. Findings [...] Chapter 5. Discussion and conclusion [...] References. Tourism is a substantial industry that serves many people in many different industries. Bricks and Mortar (B&M) travel agencies are physically established traditional travel agencies providing travel services to customers from premises accessible to the public. B&M <b>travel</b> <b>establishments</b> occupied a prime position in the market before the 1980 s. Such B&M travel agencies are refered to as intermediaries. They were the standard access point for anyone intending to go on holiday or book a business trip. They were profitable, mostly working in isolation {{from each other and}} representing a limited number of airlines or hotels. Although there had been some introductions of technology in the travel industry as early as the 1950 s, {{it was not until the}} 1990 s when Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) entered the marketplace that changes in business practices began to have a noticeable impact. The introduction of the Internet brought about a change in the fortunes of B&M travel agents. While some customers found the access to extensive information via the Internet beneficial other customers were left bewildered and perplexed in the supply chain positioning of travel products. The direct competition from Internet booking services operated by third party intermediaries and major suppliers of services such as international hotel companies intensified and made changes in the traditional travel distribution supply chain and thus increased financial pressure on travel agencies. In Australia, this pressure has resulted in a reduction in the number of businesses in the travel agent sector (disintermediation) over the past decade by some 17 %. However, some B&M travel agents, although forced into disentermediation, were able to re-invent themselves and through reintermediation survive and prosper. This scenario raised the questions: What services and strategies do customers and B&M travel agents believe have helped B&M travel agents in Australia to compete with Internet Only travel agencies? How do customers and traditional B&M travel agencies envisage the future of B&M travel agencies in the context of the industry and which should they concentrate on in the future? Why do some customers prefer to use the services of B&M travel agencies?To address these questions, a research study was instigated to analyze and report on the status of the Australian B&M travel agencies now and in the future. The research study adopted a multi-method approach using extensive literature reviews, email questionnaires, and interviews with the principal stakeholders – owner/managers of the B&M travel agents and travellers. A theoretical framework for analyzing the findings from the studies was based on Porter five forces of competition. The findings from the study suggest that B&M travel agencies are fighting back by becoming part of big establish travel houses, introducing new packages, better customer centric relationships, adding more value-generating services and are building on their core competencies while also implementing ICT to not just survive but to grow. The interviews with travellers confirmed that there is a need for a balance between human interaction and internet, better CRM, and after sales support, etc., and also contradicted the findings of the B&M travel agents as younger generation has a perception that online tickets are cheaper, human interaction is not very important, etc., but assisted in identifying areas that the B&M travel agents had not recognized as vital for future growth that includes; robust web support with a recommender system, customer after travel feedback. From the responses to the questionnaires and in-depth interviews with the principal stakeholders a recipe for success was identified, which highlighted the strategies B&M travel agencies should adopt to succeed. Personal services that cannot be replicated by Internet-only travel agents were a vital factor in the success, as was the embracing of ICT and particularly the Internet. However, these factors had to be implemented in unison; the sum was greater than the individual parts. While the future looked promising due to re-intermediation, there was one area that could face significant change in the next decade. In terms of the clientele of B&M travel agents, it was the older generation who favored them. The older traveller was more likely to use B&M travel agents. The research found this was because they were less likely to be familiar with technology, exhibited higher levels of technophobia, and preferred to pay in person rather than online.

In Father Holt’s time little Harry Esmond acted as his familiar, and faithful little servitor; beating his clothes, folding his vestments, fetching his water from the well long before daylight, ready to run anywhere for the service of his beloved priest.

Complete data from official animal welfare control of premises with dogs in Sweden (21 counties), from January 2012 to December 2014, was provided by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The objectives of the study were to identify missing data on dog welfare from the animal welfare control database; to determine the occurrence of poor welfare in general, and between professional and non-professional premises that keep dogs; to investigate whether the welfare status of dog daycare/boarding can be determined using the animal welfare control database; and recommend improvements for assessment, especially for dog daycare/boarding in Sweden. A species specific animal welfare checklist was used to assess compliance with legislation pertaining to the welfare of dogs. There were 40 control points based on animal, resource, and management-based measures on the animal welfare checklist. There were only four animal-based control points assessing social contact, cleanliness and grooming of the animals, body condition, and claw condition. During the study period it was found that there were a total of 17, 660 premises registered with the Swedish Board of Agriculture.

The consequences are considered to be major because yield losses and other damage would be high and require costly control measures. The systematic use of insecticides for vector control may create environmental impacts. With regard to risk reduction options, strategies for the prevention of introduction and for the containment of outbreaks should focus on the two main pathways (plants for planting and infectious insect vectors) and combine the most effective options in an integrated approach. For plants for planting, these could be pest-free production areas, surveillance, certification, screened greenhouse production, vector control and testing for infection and, for some plant species, treatments (e. g. thermotherapy). To prevent entry of the infectious vectors, insecticide treatments and inspection of consignments and production sites are required. The Panel has also reviewed the effectiveness of risk reduction options for X. fastidiosa and its vectors listed in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and in the EU emergency measures.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, Africa and China began to establish closer links, starting with the formation of the Forum for China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2000. FOCAC and other Africa–China relations platforms aim to promote mutually beneficial sociopolitical, socioeconomic, and sociocultural relations between these two major parts of the world. However, these closer ties are also seen by some third-party analysts, especially many scholars and politicians from the West, as attempts by China to exploit African resources to fuel its fast-growing economy and, possibly, end up colonizing the continent. Africa–China relations are thus a topic of intense academic discussion. On the back of these closer government-to-government contacts between Africa and China are also closer people-to-people interactions in the form of <b>travel</b> and the <b>establishment</b> of Diaspora communities by Africans in China and Chinese in Africa. While there is much discussion on Africa–China relations, the focus tends to lean more on the Chinese presence in Africa than on the African presence in China. There are numerous studies on the former but, {{with the exception of a}} few articles on the presence of African traders and students in China, little is known of the latter, even though an increasing number of Africans are visiting and settling in China and forming migrant communities there. This is a phenomenon that has never happened before the turn of the century and has thus led to what is often termed Africa's newest Diaspora. This book focuses on analyzing this new Diaspora, addressing the crucial question: What is it like to be an African in China? Africans in China is the first book-length study of the process of Africans travelling to China and forming communities there. Based on innovative intermingling of qualitative and quantitative research methods involving prolonged interaction with approximately 800 Africans across six main Chinese cities––Guangzhou, Yiwu, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau––sociolinguistic and sociocultural profiles are constructed to depict the everyday life of Africans in China. The study provides insights into understanding issues such as why Africans go to China, what they do there, how they communicate with their Chinese hosts, what opportunities and problems they encounter in their China sojourn, and how they are received by the Chinese state. Beyond these methodological and empirical contributions, the book also makes a theoretical contribution by proposing a crosscultural bridge theory of migrant-indigene relations, arguing that Africans in China act as sociopolitical, socioeconomic, and sociocultural bridges linking Africa to China. This approach to the analysis of Diaspora communities has consequences for crosscultural and crosslinguistic studies in an era of globalization. Africans in China is an important book for African Studies, Asian Studies, Africa–China relations studies, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, international studies, and migration and Diaspora studies in an era of globalization. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|THESIS SUBMITTED IN FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE DOCTOR TECHNOLOGIAE (D Tech) (TRAVEL AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT) IN THE FACULTY OF BUSINESS AT THE CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 2008 This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} and proposing a normative model for cultural tourism, which should be implemented on the Cape Flats. Normative criteria for cultural tourism were identified through a literature search, followed by an empirical study. Responses to various questions and statements were statistically analysed, interpreted and presented. Tourism stakeholders such as tour operators, <b>travel</b> agents, accommodation <b>establishments</b> and cultural tourism suppliers, including {{the community of the}} Cape Flats, can benefit from implementation of the normative model for cultural tourism. This study traces the roots of philosophy in the social sciences, provides a philosophical basis for cultural tourism, followed by a discussion of relevant national, provincial and local legislative frameworks for cultural tourism on the Cape Flats. In addition to the above, a comparative conceptual analysis of cultural tourism in The Gambia is made in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of successes and challenges that face destinations, which intend to offer cultural tourism as a tourism product. Developing a normative model for cultural tourism on the Cape Flats should seek to invite active participation from the community from inception phase until implementation. The research identifies and explains elements of model theory, discusses models that are applicable to the research area, and presents an adapted normative, input-output systems model with a feedback mechanism. The normative model proposes an implementation mechanism against various external and internal environmental factors as means to ensure sustainability of cultural offerings on the Cape Flats. The normative model proposes an approach that will facilitate employment in the tourism sector on the Cape Flats, as well as poverty alleviation initiatives as part of corporate social responsibility undertakings by tourism stakeholders. Variables identified in the normative model will assist tourism stakeholders, including the Cape Flats community, to develop cultural offerings for consumption by tourists, the cultural market and sustain cultural tourism, which should improve standards of living for people on the Cape Flats. The normative model for cultural tourism addresses the critical shortage of skills amongst tourism practitioners and offers recommendations to alleviate this shortcoming within the tourism industry. The normative criteria, which is identified in the model, addresses the fact that attention should given to improvement and provision of cultural tourism infrastructure on the Cape Flats. An objective of the normative model for cultural tourism is to facilitate the proposal of guidelines for National, Provincial and Local government policy initiatives regarding tourism and, in particular, cultural tourism on the Cape Flats. This model identifies aims and objectives of the White Paper on Sustainable Tourism Development (1996), the Cape Flats Tourism Framework (2005) and the Tourism Development Framework for the City of Cape Town (2006). Finally, the Cape Flats’ diverse community displays a host of unique cultural experiences and offerings in terms of folklore, history, experiences, food, song and a host of other activities that should be shared with tourists...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{dissertation}} is to study the relationship between travel as a form of knowledge and the natural history pursued at the Royal Academy of Science during the period 1790 - 1840. Primarily, this dissertation deals with the perception of travel as a form of knowledge which existed at the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, though a number of selected journeys are used to illustrate the era's shifting perceptions on travel. Chapter One compares two variants of scientific travel, Linnean and Humboldtian. While the Linnean saw single objects, the Humboldtian saw "the whole" in the form of places. Places became the new study objects and the conditions reigning there were assumed to explain the special characteristics of the objects. This is what is implied by the "place's glance". Chapter Two provides an historical background to the subsequent debate about the theory and practice of scientific travel by scrutinizing works from the apodemic handbook genre. The purpose of apodemics was to make travel a method for the disciplined, systematic gathering of knowledge, which was achieved by organizing all aspects into categories [...] In Chapter Three, the natural history of the day is understood as a multiplicity of research traditions with a common object of study - the specimens found in the three kingdoms of nature. A number of models of scientific collection which were applied by the Academy around 1800 are analyzed. The correspondent model using local amateur collectors is contrasted with the model of the travelling professional scientist. The greatest problem of the travel model was the "route problematic", engendering a haphazardness in the collection of facts and specimens. In Chapter Four, the relationship between travel and the theories of natural history of the age is investigated through a case study of Göran Wahlenberg's travels in 1800 - 1810. As a result of the insights Wahlenberg achieved during his travels in the mountain regions of the land, the new botanical sub- discipline of plant geography was established. This demanded travel, since it was based on observations of the plants' spatial relationships to one another and measurements of other specific spatial phenomena, such as climate. Wahlenberg saw complex, multifacetted aggregates of plants and vegetation, where the Linnean only discerned separate species. Herein lies the meaning of the "place's glance". Chapter Five analyzes the botanical journeys undertaken by the Academy between 1820 (when a travel grant was instituted) and 1840. Patriotic and utilitarian arguments for domestic travel combined with their results lent scientific travel a new status at the Academy. Chapter Six deals with zoological travel during the same period. The main figures are the curators of the Swedish Museum of Natural History, J. W. Dalman and B. F. Fries, who formulated the zoological travel policy of the Academy. The needs of the museum dictated that the travellers focus on Sweden and Scandinavia, primarily the "Western seaboard", which included Bohuslän and the Norwegian Atlantic coast, and Norrland. The specific needs of marine biology forced Fries to develop new <b>travel</b> practices. Fries' <b>establishment</b> of a provisional research station for year-round zoological research was an important historical breakthrough. His idea of outfitting sea-going vessels as mobile research stations also prefigures the future development of polar travel later in the century. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|The Irish immrama {{literary}} style {{seems the}} most appropriate way to represent student narratives based on their study abroad experiences in Ireland. The chapters containing the immrama of students are an ethnographic experiment in which the reflexivity students demonstrated through the interview process is presented in narrative form. This writing style provides the context for the examination of issues related to academic aspirations, professional, and personal wandering, and how study abroad experiences and tourism behaviour contribute to the transition to adulthood. The immrama {{are located in the}} evennumbered chapters. Daily challenges and student-organised travel experiences that develop as part of a study abroad have the potential to transform the participants. Eight months of fieldwork in the Republic of Ireland during the 2008 / 9 academic year revealed the types of activities students independently organised during their period as educational tourists in an international context {{and the nature of the}} learning outcomes. The most reported outcome of their sojourn was increased self-confidence. Wandering among academic settings, geographic locations, and social interactions resulted in the development of intercultural competences and the shift in frames of reference. Chapter 3 recounts the theoretical and epistemological basis for this thesis. Anthropology provides the basis for discussion of adulthood, liminality, and the development of friendship through learning opportunities inherent in study abroad programmes. Andragogical theories identify and define adult learning as independent and student-directed. This approach allows for discussion of learning such as intercultural competences, the outcomes of studying abroad, settings that foster personal development, experiences that transform students, and learning as a transition to adulthood. Chapters 5 and 7 examine the opportunities for learning and personal development that result from independent travel. Students developed friendship groups by living and <b>travelling</b> together. The <b>establishment</b> of friendship networks facilitated intercultural competences through interactions with other international students and the travel that they undertook together. Students did not think of themselves as tourists in Limerick, but did when travelling on the continent. At other times, they needed to host guests who came to visit. Study abroad was not without risks associated with credit for courses taken, personal risks associated with travel, and online risks in the use of social media. Travel and overcoming challenges resulted in the development of a sense of self-confidence and self-reliance. Students felt they learned more from travelling than they did in their courses. Chapter 9 presents the methodology that was established to conduct this research and the strategies used to collect data. The multi-sited field combined with multiple methods of data collection yielded a rich set of data. This writer participated in the activities with students during the fieldwork period, becoming an observant wanderer. Data collection was designed to elicit students’ points of view about the value and challenges of the experience. Educational ethnography in the future will need to consider issues relating to multisited ethnography, the researcher as a primary site, and autoethnography. The relationship between the students and the observer became important because as memory, storytelling and writing revealed the power of reflexivity, the ethnographer was challenged to represent the intertextuality of the process. Chapter 10 identifies the implications of methodological positioning: the importance of wandering as a legitimate strategy for learning, accounting for intertextuality in fieldwork and analysis, and the need to reconceptualise the educational ethnographic field...|$|R
