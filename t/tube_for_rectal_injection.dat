40|$|Background. Postcolonoscopy {{abdominal}} discomfort and bloating are common. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether rectal decompression improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms and influenced anorectal physiology. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, rectal distension was achieved by direct air inflation into the rectum by colonoscopy. Placement of rectal and sham tube was then performed in each subject on a separate occasion. The anorectal parameters and distension-induced abdominal symptoms were recorded. Results. Anorectal parameters were similar between placements of rectal tube and sham <b>tube</b> except <b>for</b> greater <b>rectal</b> compliance with rectal tube than with sham tube (P< 0. 05). Abdominal pain and bloating were significantly reduced by rectal tube and sham tube at 1 minute (both P< 0. 05) and 3 minutes (both P< 0. 05). After placement of rectal tube, abdominal pain at 3 minutes correlated positively with first sensation (r= 0. 53, P= 0. 04), and bloating at 3 minutes also correlated positively with urge sensation (r= 0. 55, P= 0. 03). Conclusions. Rectal decompression with either rectal or sham tube improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms. Our study indicates that the mechanisms that improved abdominal symptoms by rectal decompression might be mediated by a central pathway instead of a peripheral mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|Medical {{treatment}} of IBD is individualised to each patient. [...] The choice of which drugs {{to use and}} by which route to administer them (oral, <b>rectal,</b> <b>injection,</b> infusion) depends on factors including the type, distribution, and severity of the patient's disease, {{as well as other}} historical and biochemical prognostic factors, and patient preferences. For example, mesalazine is more useful in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms, with drugs such as prednisone, TNF inhibitors, azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine.|$|R

40|$|Several large {{randomized}} trials comparing laparoscopic versus open resection for colon cancer {{have demonstrated that}} the laparoscopic-assisted colectomy can be an acceptable alternative to an open colectomy for colon cancer [1 - 4]. These trials suggested similar oncologic outcomes (local recurrence and overall survival) for laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomies. In addition, laparoscopic-assisted resection {{may be associated with}} a shorter hospital stay with no difference in intra-, peri- and postoperative complications. To date, however, the laparoscopic resection <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer has not gained level- 1 evidence in surgical practice. A subset analysis of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, Conventional versus Laparoscopic-Assisted Surgery in Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC), reported a 34 % conversion rate with 59 % morbidity during the first 30 days after laparoscopic surgery <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer. Laparoscopic procedures <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer are regarded as technically demanding because a total mesorectal excision (TME) and autonomic nerve preservation are prerequisites for functional and oncological safety. In Korea, the laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer was introduced by some pioneering surgeons in the early 1990 ’s and currently, it is growing in popularity. In this issue, Lee et al. reported the long term oncologic outcomes for 303 patients who underwent a laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer (colon, 115; rectum, 188).

40|$|Radiotherapy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the treatment of rectal cancer. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy are mainstay techniques of radiotherapy <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer.

40|$|Treatment <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer can be {{associated}} with rectal functional impairment, increased morbidity and may impact quality of life. Restorative surgery is the preferred choice of surgery, but in some circumstances, surgery with a permanent stoma is required to ensure tumour clearance. While the aim of treatment <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer is to ensure cure where possible the long term impact of the functional impact of this treatment is not known. This thesis investigates rectal functional impairment after treatment <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer in the long-term and its impact on quality of life in rectal cancer compared with age matched colon cancer patients. It also assesses the impact of radiotherapy on this impairment and its effect on quality of life in rectal cancer. In addition, it compares {{the quality of life in}} patients with and without a primary stoma after curative surgery for colorectal cancer and determines the impact of country of birth on the perception of a stoma. This thesis finally examines the long term morbidity, local recurrence and survival associated with radiotherapy and provides a protocol for future studies to better evaluate the effects of rectal cancer treatment. Patients treated <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer have greater rectal functional impairment compared to patients treated for colon cancer. In patients treated <b>for</b> <b>rectal</b> cancer, those receiving radiotherapy had even greater rectal dysfunction. This high rate of rectal dysfunction did not impact on the global quality of life. Patients with a permanent stoma had more restricted physical activity those without a stoma but there were no differences in mental functioning.

In this cohort of patients there was no difference in morbidity between those patients who had surgery alone compared with those who had radiotherapy and surgery.
