This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming, such as cold-plasma).

In the first case, removing carbon dioxide using membrane is more energy consuming than removing it, from the same synthesis gas, using chemical absorption, leading to overall energy conversion efficiency of about 39 % for the recuperated-auto <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming</b> (R-ATR) cycle equipped with membrane vs. 45 % for the same R-ATR equipped with chemical absorption.

40|$|Abstract. Interest in {{fuel cells}} {{in recent years}} has {{promoted}} the development of hydrogen sources. Methane (the main composition of natural gas) is an optimal fuel for hydrogen production due to its rich resource and its high ratio of hydrogen to carbon. In this work, several hydrogen processes, such as steam reforming of methane, partial oxidation, and auto <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming,</b> were reviewed. Different processes exhibit different importance for hydrogen production due to their diversity on usages. In this paper the special method of natural hydrogen production from natural gas with super adiabatic rich combustion is depicted in details. Some problems of this method were analyzed and discussed. In view of the existing problems, a new method was developed to be used for conversion of natural gas to hydrogen. The method can solve the problems of flame drift, heat preservation, product cooling, and low transform efficiency. Due to its simple and compact structure, it is attractive for distributing hydrogen production system and solving the transportation and storage problems of hydrogen...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} sorption-enhanced autothermal {{reforming}} of methane is mathematically analyzed in a fixed bed reformer for pure H 2 production with in situ CO 2 capture at low temperature. A conventional Ni/MgO steam reforming catalyst is used. K-promoted hydrotalcite and lithium zirconate materials are examined as potential sorbents. A 1 D heterogeneous dynamic {{fixed bed reactor}} model is constructed and employed in the study. The model accounts for mass and thermal dispersion in the axial direction, pressure drop, and intraparticle and interfacial resistances. The process performance is analyzed under dynamic conditions with respect to key operational parameters: gas hourly space velocity, oxygen/carbon ratio, steam/carbon ratio, catalyst/sorbent ratio, operating pressure, and particle size. The influence of these parameters on gas temperature, CH 4 conversion, H 2 yield and purity, and <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming</b> efficiency is demonstrated. The process {{is found to be}} benefited from low space velocity operation (0. 05 kg/m 2 s), low pressure (4. 47 bar), small particle size (0. 5 – 1. 0 mm), and high steam/carbon ratio (6). The high heat of reaction generated during the CO 2 chemisorption on lithium zirconate is also investigated if it is sufficient to provide a heat supplement at lower oxygen/carbon ratio at the adiabatic conditions of the autothermal reforming process.

40|$|Abstract: Large {{amounts of}} global sources of remote natural {{reserves}} gas are identified {{along with the}} main objective to allow energy contained in to be moved economically to the market. The current options that are adopted to export natural gas are basically two:- 1. To liquefy the gas and ship it as LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). 2. To convert it to bulk petrochemicals in particular methanol or ammonia and other down-stream products. The last approach represents relatively small usage of the gas with limited markets. Chemical conversion before transpor-tation of natural gas to liquid (GTL), using Fisher-Tropsch process offers an attractive alternative to unlock remote sources of natural gas. It {{is reported to be}} most promising {{on the basis of its}} current level of development and its potential future improvements. The two main components of Fisher-Tropsch process are carefully examined: synthesis gas generation and its subsequent conversion to clean petroleum fuel. Different methods of producing synthesis gas are described. These include: steam re-forming, non catalytic partial oxidation (NCPO), auto <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming</b> (ATR) and combined reforming. Chemical reac-tions underlying the Fisher-Tropsch process are presented with trends of developments in the GTL technology. Commercial applications of GTL technology worldwide are cited, especially in some Arab countries. The positive impact of GTL on the environment is emphasized because of two reasons: 1 st the clean-burning properties of the produced diesel fuels, 2 nd converting natural gas to liquid allows oil producers to utilize the natural gas that would otherwise be flared and pollute the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The noble metals (NMs) {{comprise}} ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), {{and gold}} (Au). Together, these corrosion-resistant elements serve as nature's universal catalysts by binding reactant molecules neither too strongly nor too weakly. This allows for rapid catalytic transformations of reactants into useful products. Modern society, its current technologies, and its emerging renewable energy technologies are underpinned by precious metal catalysts. However, the noble metals {{are the least}} abundant elements in the lithosphere, making them prohibitively scarce and expensive for future global-scale technologies. Furthermore, the traditional catalyst engineering toolkit is ill-equipped to optimize the reactivity, stability, and loading of NM catalysts. The technologies developed in this thesis have two overarching implications. First, a method is developed to engineer non-sintered and metal-terminated transition metal carbide (TMC) nanoparticles. Featuring "noble metal-like" surface reactivity, TMCs are earth-abundant and exhibit many useful catalytic properties, such as carbon monoxide and sulfur tolerance. By designing TMC nanoparticles with controlled surface properties, this thesis offers new avenues for replacing noble metal catalysts with inexpensive alternatives. Second, a method is developed to synthesize TMC nanoparticles coated with atomically-thin noble metal monolayers. This offers new directions for improved catalyst designs by substantially enhancing reactivity and stability while reducing overall noble metal loadings. These synthetic achievements in nanoscale core-shell catalyst engineering were guided by computational quantum chemistry, model thin film studies, and advanced spectroscopic techniques.

Braidy Université de Sherbrooke, Canada Biodiesel’s contribution as a renewable energy carrier is increasing continuously. Fuel cell market penetration, although slow, is now an irreversible reality. The combination of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with biodiesel offers considerable advantages because it entails both high energy conversion efficiency and near-zero atmospheric carbon emissions. This work is aimed at proving the efficiency of a newly-developed (patent pending), Al 2 O 3 /YSZ-supported NiAl 2 O 4 spinel catalyst to steam reform biodiesel. Reforming converts biodiesel into a gaseous mixture, mainly composed of H 2 and CO, used directly as SOFC fuel. The work is performed in a test rig comprising a lab-scale, fixed-bed isothermal reactor and a product-conditioning train. The biodiesel/water mixtures are emulsified prior to their spray injection in the reactor preheating zone, where they are instantaneously vaporized and rapidly brought to the desired reaction temperature to avoid <b>thermal</b> cracking. <b>Reforming</b> takes place at gas hourly space velocities equal to or higher than those in industrial reforming units.

We find that visible light exposure of fullerene solutions in toluene, a good solvent, under ambient laboratory conditions results in C 60 oxidation to form fullerene epoxides, and subsequently causes fullerene clustering in solution. The clusters grow with time, even in absence of further illumination, and can reach dimensions from ≈ 100 nm to the μm scale over ≈ 1 day. Static light scattering suggests that resulting aggregates are fractal, with a characteristic power law (df) that increases from approximately 1. 3 to 2. 0 during light exposure.

40|$|The {{refineries}} {{need for}} hydrogen in hydrotreatment is increasing due to stricter environmental legislation {{and changes in}} product demand. At {{the same time the}} production of hydrogen in the reformers within the refineries is sinking. This has led to an increased attention on hydrogen management within refineries. Mongstad refinery is also experiencing this, and has estimated an increased need for hydrogen some time in the period 2011 to 2016. Mongstad refinery will start operating the natural gas based combined heat and power plant, Energiverk Mongstad, in 2010. Within 2014, full scale CO 2 capture will be in place. The refinery has indicated plans for yet another combined heat and power plant. This leads to a possibility of synergy effects by integration between the refinery, Energiverk Mongstad and the new plant. The thesis studies three options to provide the refinery with hydrogen and gaining synergy effects by integrating the hydrogen production with a new combined heat and power plant. The first option is to recycle the fuel gas stream in the refinery. The total potential for recycling hydrogen from this stream is 2. 4 ton/h of hydrogen. The fuel gas will be utilized in Energiverk Mongstad, and the hydrogen in the stream will be recovered by use of membrane process. The increased need for hydrogen is however estimated to be 4 ton/h and the recycling from the fuel gas stream is seen as a supplementary solution. The two latter options are two different configurations of the new combined heat and power plants for heat, power and hydrogen production in addition to CO 2 capture. The first alternative is a pre combustion CO 2 capture solution where the natural gas is reformed by auto <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming</b> into a synthesis gas. The CO 2 is removed prior to combustion. The plant has an export of 4 ton/h hydrogen before the rest of the synthesis gas is utilized for power production. The second alternative is based on conventional technology where the natural gas is combusted directly and the CO 2 is removed post combustion. This case is included with an external hydrogen production unit. Both cases are projected to deliver 120 MW low pressure steam for CO 2 capture in Energiverk Mongstad The two combined heat and power plants are modelled and simulated in HYSYS. The simulation shows that the post combustion case has an efficiency of 59 % and the pre combustion case has an efficiency of 56 %. This is due to higher electricity production in the post case. The efficiency for both cases will increase when the hydrogen or steam production increase. The two combined heat and power plants are compared economically by the net present value method. With today s prices of natural gas and electricity, none of the alternatives are profitable. With rice in electricity prices and a decline of natural gas prices they will both become economically viable although the post combustion case reaches break-even before the pre combustion case. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not easy}} to replace fossil-based fuels in the {{transport}} sector, however, an appealing solution is to use biomass and waste for the production of renewable alternatives. Thermochemical conversion of biomass for production of synthetic transport fuels by the use of gasification is a promising way to meet these goals. One of the key challenges in using gasification systems with biomass and waste as feedstock is the upgrading of the raw gas produced in the gasifier. These materials replacing oil and coal contain large amounts of demanding impurities, such as alkali, inorganic compounds, sulphur and chlorine compounds. Therefore, as for all multi-step processes, the heat management and hence the total efficiency depend on the different clean-up units. Unfortunately, the available conventional gas filtering units for removing particulates and impurities, and also subsequent catalytic conversion steps have lower optimum working temperatures than the operating temperature in the gasification units. This report focuses on on-going research and development to find new technology solutions and on the key critical technology challenges concerning the purification and upgrading of the raw gas to synthesis gas and the subsequent different fuel synthesis processes, such as hot gas filtration, clever heating solutions and a higher degree of process integration as well as catalysts more resistant towards deactivation. This means that the temperature should be as high as possible for any particular upgrading unit in the refining system. Nevertheless, the temperature and pressure of the cleaned synthesis gas must meet the requirements of the downstream application, i. e. Fischer-Tropsch diesel or methanol. Before using the gas produced in the gasifier a number of impurities needs to be removed. These include particles, tars, sulphur and ammonia. Particles are formed in gasification, irrespective of the type of gasifier design used. A first, coarse separation is performed in one or several cyclone filters at high temperature. Thereafter bag-house filters (e. g. ceramic or textile) maybe used to separate the finer particles. A problem is, however, tar condensation in the filters and there is much work performed on trying to achieve filtration at as high a temperature as possible. The far most stressed technical barriers regarding cleaning of the gases are tars. To remove the tar from the product gas there is a number of alternatives, but most important is that the gasifier is operated at optimal conditions for minimising initial tar formation. In fluid bed and entrained flow gasification a first step may be catalytic tar cracking after particle removal. In fluid bed gasification a catalyst, active in tar cracking, may be added to the fluidising bed to further remove any tar formed in the bed. In this kind of tar removal, natural minerals such as dolomite and olivine, are normally used, or catalysts normally used in hydrocarbon reforming or cracking. The tar can be reformed to CO and hydrogen by <b>thermal</b> <b>reforming</b> as well, when the temperature is increased to 1300 ºC and the tar decomposes. Another method for removing tar from the gas is to scrub it by using hot oil (200 - 300 ºC). The tar dissolves in the hot oil, which can be partly regenerated and the remaining tar-containing part is either burned or sent back to the gasifier for regasification. Other important aspects are that the sulphur content of the gas depends on the type of biomass used, the gasification agent used etc., but a level at or above 100 ppm is not unusual. Sulphur levels this high are not acceptable if there are catalytic processes down-stream, or if the emissions of e. g. SO 2 are to be kept down. The sulphur may be separated by adsorbing it in ZnO, an irreversible process, or a commercially available reversible adsorbent can be used. There is also the possibility of scrubbing the gas with an amine solution. If a reversible alternative is chosen, elementary sulphur may be produced using the Claus process. Furthermore, the levels of ammonia formed in gasification (3, 000 ppm is not uncommon) are normally not considered a problem. When combusting the gas, nitrogen or in the worst case NOx (so-called fuel NOx) is formed; there are, however, indications that there could be problems. Especially when the gasification is followed by down-stream catalytic processes, steam reforming in particular, where the catalyst might suffer from deactivation by long-term exposure to ammonia. The composition of the product gas depends very much on the gasification technology, the gasifying agent and the biomass feedstock. Of particular significance is the choice of gasifying agent, i. e. air, oxygen, water, since it has a huge impact on the composition and quality of the gas, The gasifying agent also affects the choice of cleaning and upgrading processes to syngas and its suitability for different end-use applications as fuels or green chemicals. The ideal upgraded syngas consists of H 2 and CO at a correct ratio with very low water and CO 2 content allowed. This means that the tars, particulates, alkali salts and inorganic compounds mentioned earlier have to be removed for most of the applications. By using oxygen as the gasifying agent, instead of air, the content of nitrogen may be minimised without expensive nitrogen separation. In summary, {{there are a number of}} uses with respect to produced synthesis gas. The major applications will be discussed, starting with the production of hydrogen and then followed by the synthesis of synthetic natural gas, methanol, dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel and higher alcohol synthesis, and describing alternatives combining these methods. The SNG and methanol synthesis are equilibrium constrained, while the synthesis of DME (one-step route), FT diesel and alcohols are not. All of the reactions are exothermal (with the exception of steam reforming of methane and tars) and therefore handling the temperature increase in the reactors is essential. In addition, the synthesis of methanol has to be performed at high pressure (50 - 100 bar) to be industrially viable. There will be a compromise between the capital cost of the whole cleaning unit and the system efficiency, since solid waste, e. g. ash, sorbents, bed material and waste water all involve handling costs. Consequently, installing very effective catalysts, results in unnecessary costs because of expensive gas cleaning; however the synthesis units further down-stream, especially for Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and DME/methanol will profit from an effective gas cleaning which extends the catalysts life-time. The catalyst materials in the upgrading processes essentially need to be more stable and resistant to different kinds of deactivation. Finally, process intensification is an important development throughout chemical industries, which includes simultaneous integration of both synthesis steps and separation, other examples are advanced heat exchangers with heat integration in order to increase the heat transfer rates. Another example is to combine exothermic and endothermic reactions to support reforming reactions by using the intrinsic energy content.

Det är en stor utmaning att ersätta fossila bränslen inom transportsektorn, en tilltalande lösning är att använda biomassa och avfall för produktion av förnyelsebara drivmedel. Termokemisk omvandling av biomassa är ett lovande sätt för att producera olika sorters syntetiska drivmedel, då främst genom förgasningsteknik. En av de främsta utmaningarna i att använda termokemisk omvandling av biomassa och avfall är en rening och uppgradering av rågasen som produceras i förgasaren. Dessa material som är tänkta att ersätta olja och kol innehåller betydande mängder av alkaliska-, oorganiska-, svavel- och klor-föreningar. De olika renings- och uppgraderingsstegen påverkar den totala verkningsgraden på hela processen, därför blir hanteringen av värme i de olika process strömmarna viktiga, som för alla processer i flera steg. Dessvärre, har de tillgängliga konventionella gas filtreringsenheterna för att ta bort partiklar och orenheter, och även efterföljande katalytiska omvandlingssteg, lägre optimala arbetstemperaturer än driftstemperaturen hos förgasningsenheterna. Denna rapport fokuserar på pågående forskning och utveckling för att hitta ny teknik och lösningar när det gäller rening och uppgradering av rågas till syntesgas, samt efterföljande bränslesyntesprocesser, såsom hetgas-filtrering, smarta uppvärmnings lösningar och högre grad av integrationsprocess, samt katalysatorer som är mer tåliga mot deaktivering. Detta innebär att temperaturen bör vara så hög som möjligt för varje enskild renings- och en uppgraderingsenhet, likväl måste temperaturen och trycket hos den renade syntesgasen uppfylla kraven för nedströms bränslesyntes, d. v. s. Fischer-Tropsch-diesel eller metanol. Ett antal orenheter behöver tas bort innan gasen som producerats i förgasaren kan användas, dessa inkluderar partiklar, tjäror, svavelföreningar och ammoniak. Partiklar bildas alltid vid förgasning, oberoende av vilken typ av förgasningsteknik som används, en första grovseparation utförs i en eller flera cyklonfilter vid höga temperaturer. För att separera de finare partiklarna används därefter olika keramiska- eller textilfilter, ett problem är dock kondensation av tjära i filtren, mycket arbete utförs på att försöka uppnå filtrering vid så hög temperatur som möjligt, så att man slipper tjärproblemen. Det största hindret när det gäller rening och uppgradering av gaserna är tjära. För att bli av med tjäran från produktgasen finns ett antal olika alternativ, men det väsentligaste är att själva förgasaren drivs vid optimala förhållanden för att minimera att tjära bildas överhuvudtaget. För förgasning med fluidiserad bädd och entrained flowförgasning skulle det första steget kunna vara katalytisk tjärkrackning efter att ha avlägsnat alla partiklar. Vid förgasning i fluidiserad bädd kan aktiva katalysatorer tillsättas till den fluidiserande bädden som kan kracka tjäran redan i bädden och hindra att ytterligare eventuell tjära bildas. Katalysatorer som används är främst naturliga mineraler, såsom dolomit och olivin, dessa användes normalt vid reformering eller krackning av kolväten. Tjäran kan reformeras till vätgas och kolmonoxid genom termisk reformering såsom när temperaturen höjs till 1300 ºC och tjäran sönderfaller. En annan metod för att avlägsna tjära från gasen är att tvätta gasen med hjälp av het olja (200 - 300 ºC). Tjäran löser sig i den heta oljan, som delvis kan vara regenererad och den återstående tjärhaltiga delen kan antingen brännas eller återföras till förgasaren för förgasning. Svavelföreningar är en annan viktig kontaminering som behöver tas bort ur gasen, svavelhalten i gasen beror främst på vilken typ av biomassa som används. Nivåer över 100 ppm inte är ovanligt och är inte acceptabelt för efterföljande nedströms katalytiska processer, eller om utsläppen av t. ex. SO 2  ska hållas nere. Svavel kan separeras genom adsorption med ZnO som är en irreversibel process, eller genom kommersiellt tillgängliga reversibla adsorbenter som kan användas. Ytterligare alternativ är att tvätta/skrubba gasen med en aminlösning. Om ett reversibelt alternativ används kan elementärt svavel framställas med hjälp av Claus-processen. Ammoniak bildas vid förgasning och nivåer runt 3000 ppm är inte ovanligt, men anses vanligtvis inte ett problem efterföljande nedströms processer. Om gasen förbränns, kan dock kväve eller i värsta fall NOx (så kallad bränsle NOx) bildas. Det finns dock indikationer på att problem kan uppstå, speciellt när förgasning följs av nedströms katalytiska processer, exempelvis vid ångreformering där katalysatorn kan deaktiveras vid långvarig exponering för ammoniak Sammansättningen på produktgasen beror framförallt på valet av förgasningsteknik, vilket förgasningsmedel som används, samt viken sorts biomassa sam används. Valet av förgasningsmedel, dvs. luft, syre, vatten, är extra viktigt eftersom det har en direkt inverkan på sammansättningen och kvaliteten hos gasen. Valet av förgasningsmedel påverkar också vilka renings- och uppgraderingsprocesser som kan användas och lämpar sig bäst för olika slutanvändningstillämpningar som t. ex. drivmedel eller för gröna kemikalier. Idealt består en syntesgas som är uppgraderad av vätgas och kolmonoxid i korrekt förhållande, med mycket låga halter vatten och koldioxid. Detta innebär att tjäror, partiklar, alkalisalter och oorganiska föreningar, som nämnts tidigare, måste avlägsnas för de flesta tillämpningarna. Genom att använda syre som förgasningsmedel, i stället för luft, kan innehållet av kväve i gasen minimeras, så man undviker efterföljande dyrbar separation av kväve. Sammanfattningsvis finns det ett antal olika användningsområden för olika producerade syntesgaser. De olika tillämpningarna kommer att diskuteras i rapporten med början med produktion av vätgas, följt av framställning av syntetisk naturgas (SNG), metanol, dimetyleter, Fischer-Tropsch-diesel och syntes av högre alkoholer, samt beskrivningar av metoder som kombinerar dessa. Processystemen är olika där syntes av SNG och metanol begränsas jämvikt, medan syntes av dimetyleter, (DME), FT-diesel och alkoholer inte är jämviktsberoende. Samtliga reaktioner är exoterma, med undantag för ångreformering av metan och tjäror, vilket medför att det är viktigt att kontrollera temperaturökningen i reaktorerna. Dessutom måste syntes av metanol utföras vid högt tryck (50 - 100 bar) för att vara industriellt gångbar. För att hålla nere kapitalkostnaderna för hela reningssystemet och systemets effektivitet behöver man kompromissa, eftersom hanteringen av fast avfall, t. ex. aska, absorberande medel, bäddmaterial och avloppsvatten alla innebär kostnader. Att installera väldigt effektiva katalysatorer resulterar i dyrare gasrening på grund av onödiga kostnader, men nedströms syntesprocesser kommer att dra nytta av effektiv gasrening som förlänger katalysatorernas livstid, särskilt för Fischer-Tropsch-diesel, och DME/metanol syntes. Generellt måste katalysatorerna i de olika uppgraderingsprocesserna vara mer stabila och motståndskraftiga mot olika typer av deaktivering. Slutligen är process-intensifiering ett viktigt område för utveckling inom hela kemiindustrin som bland annat omfattar integration av både syntes och separationssteg, med olika former av avancerad värmeväxling med värmeintegration för att öka värmeöverföringshastigheten, och att kombinera exoterma och endoterma reaktioner. Därför är det nödvändigt med nya innovativa lösningar för rening och uppgradering av gaserna för att få fram kostnadseffektiva och effektiva tillämpningar...|$|E

Different processes (pyrolysis, steam reforming and dry reforming) are compared, using a commercial activated carbon as catalyst. The reforming processes that employ oxidizing agents (CO 2 or H 2 O) were found to promote higher glycerol conversions than mere <b>thermal</b> decomposition. Steam <b>reforming</b> generates the lowest gas fraction and the highest amounts of hydrogen and syngas, while the opposite occurs in the dry reforming experiments.

Detailed catalytic mechanisms of RuO 2 during supercritical water gasification of common polyolefin plastics including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PP), have been investigated in a batch reactor at 450 °C, 60 min. All four plastics gave very high carbon gasification efficiencies (CGE) and hydrogen gasification efficiencies (HGE). Methane was the highest gas component, with a yield of up to 37 mol kg− 1 LDPE using the 20 wt% RuO 2 catalyst. Evaluation of the gas yields, CGE and HGE revealed that the conversion of PS involved <b>thermal</b> degradation, steam <b>reforming</b> and methanation; whereas hydrogenolysis was a possible additional mechanism during the conversion of aliphatic plastics.

40|$|Tar {{content in}} syngas {{pyrolysis}} {{is a serious}} problem for fuel gas utilization in downstream applications. This paper investigated tar removal, by the two-step function of decomposition and adsorption, from the pyrolysis gas. The temperature of the tar decomposition process was fixed at 800 Â Â°C both with and without steam, with air as the reforming agent. Both steam and air had a strong influence on the tar decomposition reaction. The reduction of the gravimetric tar mass was 78 % {{in the case of the}} thermal cracking, whereas, it was in the range of 77 - 92 % in the case of the steam and air forming. Under conditions of tar decomposition, the gravimetric tar mass reduced, while the yield of the combustible gaseous components in the syngas increased. Synchronously, the amount of light tars increased. This should be eliminated later by fixed-bed adsorption. Three adsorbents (activated carbon, wood chip, and synthetic porous cordierite) were selected to evaluate the adsorption performance of light tars, especially of condensable tar. Activated carbon showed the best adsorption performance among all light tars, in view of the adsorption capacity and breakthrough time. On the other hand, activated carbon decreased the efficiency of the system due to its high adsorption performance with non-condensable tar, which is a combustible substance in syngas. Synthetic porous cordierite showed very low adsorption performance with almost all light tars, whereas, wood chip showed a high adsorption performance with condensable tar and low adsorption performance with non-condensable tar. When compared with other adsorbents, wood chip showed a prominent adsorption selectivity that was suitable for practical use, by minimizing the condensable tar without decreasing the efficiency of the system.

40|$|Meat {{and bone}} meal (MBM) is a {{byproduct}} of the rendering industries. It {{is found to be}} responsible for the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals and is no longer used as a feed to animals. There are various methods for disposal of MBM such as land filling, incineration, combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. Gasification appears {{to be one of the}} best options. High temperature of gasification reaction destroys the potential BSE pathogens and produces gases which can be further used to produce valuable liquid chemicals by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or to generate electricity. Gasification of meat and bone meal followed by <b>thermal</b> cracking/ <b>reforming</b> of tar was carried out using oxygen and steam separately at atmospheric pressure using a two-stage fixed bed reaction system in series. The first stage was used for the gasification and the second stage was used for <b>thermal</b> cracking/ <b>reforming</b> of tar. Meat and bone meal was successfully gasified in the two-stage fixed bed reaction system using two different oxidants (oxygen and steam) separately. In gasification using oxygen, the effects of temperature (650 – 850 °C) of both stages, equivalence ratio (ER) (actual O 2 supply/stoichiometric O 2 required for complete combustion) (0. 15 – 0. 3) and the second stage packed bed height (40 – 100 mm) on the product (char, tar and gas) yield and gas (H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8) composition were studied. It was observed that the two-stage process increased hydrogen production from 7. 3 to 22. 3 vol. % (N 2 free basis) and gas yield from 30. 8 to 54. 6 wt. % compared to single stage. Temperature and equivalence ratio had significant effects on the hydrogen production and product distribution. It was observed that higher gasification (850 °C) and cracking (850 °C) reaction temperatures were favorable for higher gas yield of 52. 2 wt. % at packed bed height of 60 mm and equivalence ratio of 0. 2. The tar yield decreased from 18. 6 wt. % to 14. 2 wt. % and that of gas increased from 50. 6 wt. % to 54. 6 wt. % by changing the packed bed height of second stage from 40 to 100 mm while the gross heating value (GHV) of the product gas remained almost constant (16. 2 – 16. 5 MJ/m 3). In gasification using steam, effects of temperature (650 – 850 °C) of each stage, steam/MBM (wt/ wt) (0. 4 - 0. 8), and packed bed height (40 - 100 mm) in second stage on the product (Char, liquid and gas) distribution and gas (H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4, other H/C) composition were studied. It was observed that higher reaction temperature (850 °C) was favorable for high gas and hydrogen yields. Char gasification improved from 27 to 13 wt. % and hydrogen yield increased from 36. 2 to 49. 2 vol. % with increase in steam/MBM (wt/ wt), while with increased in packed bed height increased gas (29. 5 to 31. 6 wt. %) and hydrogen (45 to 49. 2 vol. %) yields. It didn’t show substantial effect on heavier hydrocarbons. The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis of meat and bone meal were determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at three different heating rates (10, 15 and 25 °C/min) using distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The activation energy was found in the range of 60 - 246 kJ/mol for the temperature range of 496 - 758 K and their corresponding frequency factors were 6. 63 x 103 to 8. 7 x 1014 s- 1...|$|R
50|$|Among {{hydrogen}} production {{methods such as}} steam methane <b>reforming,</b> <b>thermal</b> cracking, coal and biomass gasification and pyrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis, biological ones are more eco-friendly and less energy intensive. In addition, {{a wide variety of}} waste and low-value materials such as agricultural biomass as renewable sources can be utilized to produce hydrogen via biochemical pathways. Nevertheless, at present hydrogen is produced mainly from fossil fuels, in particular, natural gas which are non-renewable sources. Hydrogen is not only the cleanest fuel but also widely used in a number of industries, especially fertilizer, petrochemical and food ones. This makes it logical to investigate alternative sources for {{hydrogen production}}. The main biochemical technologies to produce hydrogen are dark and photo fermentation processes. In dark fermentation, carbohydrates are converted to hydrogen by fermentative microorganisms including strict anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria. A theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol glucose can be produced and, besides hydrogen, sugars are converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols as by-products during this process. Photo fermentative bacteria are able to generate hydrogen from VFAs. Hence, metabolites formed in dark fermentation can be used as feedstock in photo fermentation to enhance the overall yield of hydrogen.|$|R

Fuel Cells, 15 (3), pp. 516 - 522, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance With Wiley-VCH Terms and Conditions for self-archiving. Hydrogen fuelled polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) offer clear environmental benefits. Lack of viable hydrogen infrastructure in the near future means that a key issue is availability of hydrogen at the point of use. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) offers advantages as a fuel over other hydrocarbons because there is already an infrastructure in place for remote areas. Hydrogen supply via steam reforming of LPG is therefore a feasible avenue of achieving the environmental benefits. Commercial grade LPG unavoidably contain sulphur as an odorant, the sulphur needs to be removed from the fuel stream before it reaches the reformer catalyst and fuel cell. Utilizing sulphur tolerant catalysts in the reformer leads to a simpler fuel processor design. <b>Thermal</b> management and <b>reforming</b> efficiency has been a challenge for the sulphur tolerant catalysts. In this paper, a multi-function compact micro-channel reactor designed for hydrocarbon steam reforming was evaluated for use with LPG. A sulphur tolerant catalyst was wash-coated on to the reforming layers. The reformer was tested over a wide range of reactor temperatures, steam to carbon ratios and fuel flow rates. Over 60 % of H 2 composition can be achieved at high reforming temperatures with a LPG supply rate of 0. 75 [*]dm 3 [*]min− 1 (STP) and a S/C ratio of 4...|$|R
40|$|In this article, hybrid steam {{reforming}} (HSR) of desulphurized methane, together with crude glycerol, in existing commercial steam reformers to produce synthesis gas is proposed. The proposed concept {{consists of a}} gasifier to produce vapors, gases, and char from crude glycerol, which is coupled with a pre-reformer to further convert the vapors into gases using a {{steam reforming}} catalyst. These gases are mixed with methane and subsequently reformed to synthesis gas (CO + H 2) in a primary reformer, using a steam reforming catalyst. In the present work, gasification, steam, and hybrid reforming of glycerol are reported. The total product distribution (gas, vapor, and char) of pure and crude glycerol gasification was quantified at different reaction temperatures at very high heating rates (atomization, 106 °C/min). With pure and neutralized crude glycerol, no char formation was observed. However, with crude glycerol and pure glycerol doped with KOH, {{a significant amount of}} char on carbon basis (10 %) is produced. The results obtained here show that KOH present in glycerol was responsible for polymerizing higher molecular components formed during <b>thermal</b> degradation. Steam <b>reforming</b> of pure and neutralized crude glycerol was studied at different process conditions in the presence of commercial reforming catalysts. Pure glycerol was easier (in terms of catalyst activity) to reform when compared to neutralized crude glycerol at high temperature (800 °C). The results from the steam reforming of neutralized crude glycerol show that the loss of catalyst activity was due to the presence of organic impurities such as FAMEs, diglycerides, and triglycerides. The proposed HSR concept was demonstrated using 28 wt % pure glycerol and 72 wt % methane (on C 1 basis) in a two-stage fixed bed reformer at 800 °C using commercial steam reforming catalys...|$|R
40|$|Energy carriers, such as coal, {{natural gas}} and biomass, can be {{converted}} by Fischer-Tropsch technology into synthetic crude (syncrude). Fischer-Tropsch derived syncrude can then be refined to transportation fuels, such as motor-gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel. These fuels meet the same specifications as crude oil derived transportation fuels. Conventional refining technologies have to be adapted to deal with Fischer-Tropsch syncrudes, because they differ significantly from crude oil with respect to composition. Some of the key differences are the high concentration of oxygenates and olefins and absence of sulphur in Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. Imposing a crude oil refining methodology on syncrude can lead to unwieldy and expensive refineries. Yet, despite an abundance of literature of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, there is little literature that deals with the refining of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. The present study investigated current refining practice for both crude oil and Fischer-Tropsch syncrude {{in order to identify}} fundamental differences in their refining focus and conversion behaviour. This was followed by a critical evaluation of the compatibility of syncrudes from high temperature Fischer-Tropsch (HTFT) and low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) synthesis with the chemistry and catalysis of various conversion processes. The conversion processes that were evaluated include isomerisation, oligomerisation, etherification, alkylation, metathesis, hydrogenation, hydroisomerisation, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking, coking, <b>thermal</b> cracking, catalytic <b>reforming</b> and dehydration. The recommendations from the technology evaluation provided the foundation for the development of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude based refinery designs. Refinery designs were developed to determine configurations that would maximise the production of on-specification motor-gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel respectively. It could be shown that less complex refinery designs were required to refine Fischer-Tropsch syncrude to motor-gasoline and jet fuel, than were required for crude oil refining. It was also shown that on a molecular level Fischer-Tropsch syncrude is unsuited for maximising the production of Euro- 4 type diesel fuel. The present study illustrates the advantage of considering fundamentals in developing refineries specifically for Fischer-Tropsch syncrude, rather than imposing crude oil design practises on Fischer-Tropsch syncrude refinery designs.

40|$|ORWARE, an {{evolving}} systems analysis based computer model {{is used to}} assess the performance of different waste management options from a life cycle perspective. The present version of the model consists of different submodels for transport, treatment, and disposal of different types of liquid and solid wastes and recycling of materials. Flows between submodels are described by a vector of several substances of different relevance to the system. The model calculates emissions to water and air, amount of residues returned to arable land and energy flows using the tools of life cycle analysis (LCA) and substance flow analysis (SFA). In going in the direction of stringent environmental standards and policies, {{there is a need for}} maximizing energy recovery from waste for both environmental and economic benefits. Sweden has already experience of recovering energy from waste for district heating. Recovering energy not only of high value but also of higher quality from waste would be of interest. Hydrogen is one carrier of such energy. The possibility of using hydrogen from waste as a fuel in the transport sector would contribute in heading for creating a clean environment. In this thesis a new submodel for steam reforming of biogas recovered from an anaerobic digester is developed and used with other submodels within the ORWARE framework. Four scenarios representing alternative ways of energy recovery from the organic waste in Stockholm have been simulated to compare the associated energy turnover and different environmental impacts. Digestion of the organic waste and using the biogas to fuel cars is compared against steam reforming of biogas to hydrogen or thermal gasification of the waste and processing the product gases to hydrogen. In the latter two cases hydrogen produced is used in fuel cell cars. Avoided impacts of using the biogas and hydrogen are analyzed using the fourth scenario where the waste is incinerated to generate heat and electricity. Functional equivalence between scenarios is achieved by external supply of heat, electricity and petrol. While recognizing the uncertainties during modelling and simulation, it is possible to conclude that the results indicate that there is advantage of reduced environmental impact and high energy turnover in introducing the technologies of producing hydrogen from waste into the waste management system. Further and thorough investigation is recommended to come up with a sound and firm conclusion.

40|$|Synthesis of new {{catalytic}} {{materials for}} hydrogen production via steam reforming of bio-oil’ {{is motivated by}} the need to provide a solution for essential problems concerning environmental issues and the need for new energy sources. Renewable energy sources have much lower carbon footprint and they are naturally replenished. The doctorate thesis is part of the afore-mentioned research activity and focuses on the production of hydrogen as energy carrier from renewable sources and especially from biomass - reforming of model compounds of bio-oil. The aim of the thesis is the development of active and stable catalytic materials for the full conversion of the oxygenated compounds -acetic acid, acetone, ethylene glycol- via the reforming reaction with high hydrogen yield and low coke deposition. The first step of our research was the study of the thermodynamic equilibrium {{in a wide range of}} operating variables such as temperature, pressure and steam to oxygenated compound ratio. Optimum conditions for the reforming reaction, concerning the high hydrogen yield, and the low coke deposition, were Treaction. = 627 °C, S/Cfeed= 3, at atmospheric pressure while the autothermal conditions in reforming reactor are achieved with 0. 3 - 0. 6 molO 2 /mol of oxygenate compound depending on the type of the feed. The experimental study, started with the examination of the <b>thermal</b> decomposition and <b>reforming</b> in the absence and the presence of steam. Τhe effect of the type of the metal, Ni and noble, and the type of the support, mixed oxide of calcium-aluminate and cerium-zirconium, to hydrogen production, and to activity and stability of the catalyst and the coke deposition was investigated. The catalytic materials supported on calcium-aluminate mixed oxides are very active in steam reforming of acetic acid at 750 °C. The 5 %Ni/CaO. 2 Al 2 O 3 catalyst is very active even at 550 °C with very low coke depositions. The addition of the Rh, decreased the coke deposition at 1. 6 %wt coke on catalyst after three hour experiment. Τhe combination of Ni and Rh as active metals supported on mixed cerium-zirconium oxide is an excellent choice for the reaction of steam reforming of acetic acid. These catalytic materials are very active at 550 - 750 °C, with high hydrogen yield and minimal coke depositions. Especially the Rh catalyst minimises the produced coke at 0. 36 %wt. Optimization of the Rh catalyst is achieved with La addition and the catalyst 0. 5 %Rh- 3 %La/CeO 2 -ZrO 2, appears to be stable with time on stream. The 0. 5 %Rh- 3 %La/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 catalyst, exhibits high hydrogen yields and low coke deposition in the steam reforming of acetone and ethylene glycol. Finally, the unravellling of the mechanism of the reforming reaction accomplished by temperature programmed steam reforming experiments of acetic acid and its isotopes CH 3 COOD and CD 3 COOD. The most important conclusion is that the steam reforming reaction of acetic acid proceeds via decomposition of its molecule into active methyl radicals. ...|$|R
40|$|Graphite {{is used in}} gas-cooled {{reactors}} (e. g. AGR, MAGNOX, HTR) and Russian RMBK reactors as a moderafor and reflector. About 250, 000 Mg of irradiated graphite (i-graphite) has to {{be considered}} as radioactive waste {{in the next few}} centuries. Fission products and activation of impurities in the graphite contaminate this graphite during reactor operation. Key nuclides for waste management are Co- 60 during decommissioning, if decommissioning is performed immediately after reactor shutdown, and the long living radionuclides C- 14 and Cl- 36 for long-term safety in the case of direct disposal. Most radioisotopes can, in principle, be removed by using the purification methods already applied during the manufacture of nuclear graphite. However, due to the same chemical behaviour as C- 12, this {{does not seem to be}} applicable to C- 14. Contaminated graphite cannot be stored in low-level surface disposal facilities such as Centre de L'Aube, in France, due to the long half-life of C- 14 [Millington, D. N [...] Sneyers, A., Mouliney, M. H., Abram, T., Brucher, H., 2006. Report on the international Regulation as regards HTR/VHTR Waste Management, Deliverable D-BF 1. 1 of the Raphael Project, EC Contract 516508, Confidential report]. Furthermore, the C- 14 activity of the graphite reflectors from the two German HTR reactors (AVR and THTR) would amount to more than 90 % of the total C- 14 activity licensed for the underground disposal site Konrad in Germany for non-heat-generating radioactive waste [Brennecke, P., October 1993. Anforderungen an endzulagernde radioaktive Abfalle (Vorlaufige Endlagerbedingungen, Stand: April 1990 in der Fassung vom Oktober 1993) - Schachtanlage Konrad -, BfS-ET- 3 / 90 -REV- 2, Salzgitter, p. 51]. The burning of nuclear graphite would be an efficient method for volume reduction, but would not be accepted by the public as long as all the C- 14 were emitted into the atmosphere in the form of CO 2. The required separation of the C- 14 from the off-gas is difficult and not economic because this carbon isotope has the same chemical properties as the C- 12 from the graphite matrix. The solidification of the whole amount of CO 2 would cancel out the volume reduction advantage of burning. Thus, a process is required which benefits from the inhomogeneous distribution of the C- 14 in the graphite matrix leading to C- 14 -enriched and C- 14 -depleted off gas streams (Schmidt, P. C., 1979. Alternativen zur Verminderung der C- 14 -Emission bei der Wiederaufarbeitung von HTR-Brennelementen, JUL- 1567]. Tritium and other radioisotopes, including Cl- 36 and I- 129, can be removed from graphite by thermal treatment. Even significant parts of the C- 14 inventory can be selectively extracted because most of the C- 14 may be adsorbed on the surface of the crystallites in the pore structure and not integrated into the crystal lattice. This has recently been demonstrated in principle by the HTR-N/N 1 project. As an accompaniment to <b>thermal</b> treatments, steam <b>reforming</b> is an alternative method for decontaminating graphite from radionuclides. The decontamination rates are even higher in comparison to pure thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere, as was first evidenced by basic experiments in the HTR-N/N 1 project.
