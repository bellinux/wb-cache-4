5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and {{to other parts of}} the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the LGOC and had a negative impact on <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the whole UERL group.|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} associated with innovation, {{it is difficult to}} assess <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> potential <b>of</b> business model innovations. However, since theory predicts and explains, and assessing <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> potential <b>of</b> a business model is about predicting what its profitability will be in the future, we can use strategy theories to help with the assessment. Therefore, I draw on three strategic management theories—the resource-based view, the product-market position view, and the dynamic capabilities perspective to derive a framework for assessing <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> potential <b>of</b> a business model innovation. I then illustrate how the framework could work by applying it to Quirky's crowdsourcing business model innovation...|$|R

This {{research}} is dedicated to analyze whether or not the variables of liquidity, sales growth, working capital turnover, company size, and leverage have influence over <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> rate <b>of</b> manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The population of this research is every manufacturing company enlisted in the BEI at the year 2005 - 2009.

This research used regression analysis method to find out the effect of independent variables, which are liquidity, sales growth, working capital turnover, company size, and leverage to <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> rate (ROA) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.

Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the system, including the Power Stone series, in addition to a temporary exclusive in the popular Resident Evil series called Resident Evil Code: Veronica.

5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> crop production.|$|E
5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the MR.|$|E

5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E
5|$|The English and Dutch {{partitioned}} {{the island}} in 1614, as the aggression was hampering <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> both groups. That year the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand {{and was able to}} dominate the whaling and fend off the English. The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and there were {{only a limited number of}} aggressive incidents. By the end of the 18th century, whaling had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Stjørdal {{remained}} a controversy. The river Stjørdalselva created a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, making it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river until Hegra. This would make the line bypass Stjørdalshalsen on the north shore, the largest town between Trondheim and Östersund. Despite massive local protests, Parliament ultimately chose the southern alternative. The added distance reduced Stjørdalshalsen's trade role while reducing railway revenue as the steam ships continued to run on the route, thus reducing <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the line. Stjørdalselva Bridge was opened in 1902 when the Hell–Sunnan Line opened to Stjørdal.|$|E
5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: {{to get access to}} a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing <b>the</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the {{agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual {{rate of growth of}} exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification.|$|E
