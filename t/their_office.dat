5|$|The ispáns of the Transylvanian {{counties}} of Doboka, Hunyad, Kolozs, Küküllő and Torda were not listed among the witnesses of royal charters {{from the beginning}} of the 13thcentury, hinting that their direct connection to the monarchs had by that time been interrupted. Thereafter they were employed by the voivode who appointed and dismissed them at will. Only the heads of Szolnok County remained directly connected to the monarchs for a longer period, until <b>their</b> <b>office</b> was united with the voivodeship in the 1260s.

5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines <b>their</b> <b>office</b> budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and the clerks {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal.

A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.|$|E

5|$|The Director General of the Indian Coast Guard (DG ICG) is {{the head}} of the Indian Coast Guard. The DG ICG has <b>their</b> <b>office</b> in the Coast Guard Headquarters (CGHQ) in New Delhi.

The Additional Director General of the ICG serves as the second-in-command to the Director General. The post of Director General of the Indian Coast Guard is held by a three-star rank holder as a position and is not a rank in itself. It is a Commander-in-Chief grade and is equivalent to Vice Admiral of the Indian Navy, Lieutenant General of the Indian Army and the Air Marshal of the Indian Air Force.

5|$|The {{designers}} {{conceived the}} Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning <b>their</b> <b>office</b> façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role {{was replaced with}} loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.|$|E
5|$|The last {{king of the}} Roman Kingdom, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, {{was overthrown}} in 509 BC {{by a group of}} noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus. Tarquin made a number of {{attempts}} to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives. The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic involved a new form of chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term. Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of <b>their</b> <b>office.</b> Consular political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were no {{different from those of the}} old king.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both {{clergy and}} laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade {{the use of}} Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties. Soegijapranata attempted to resist these seizures, at times filling the locations with people to make them unmanageable or indicating that other buildings, such as cinemas, would serve Japanese needs better. When the Japanese attempted to seize Randusari Cathedral, Soegijapranata replied that they could take it only after decapitating him; the Japanese later found another location for <b>their</b> <b>office.</b> He prevented the Japanese from taking Gedangan Presbytery, where he lived, and assigned guardians for schools and other facilities to prevent seizure. These efforts were not always successful, however, and several Church-run institutions were seized, as were church funds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evening before}} {{the last day of}} classes is known as Senior Night.

Students first [...] "decorate" [...] the campus and <b>their</b> professors' <b>offices,</b> and then {{barricade}} themselves in the academic buildings, armed with waterguns and water balloons. Professors arrive the next morning armed with their own water weaponry and storm the office buildings, trying to get into <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> so that they can hold classes. Due to water damage sustained by the structure of Warfield Hall, water battles are no longer allowed in the building. Students instead devise a series of mental and physical challenges for professors to overcome, before they are allowed into <b>their</b> <b>offices.</b>|$|R
