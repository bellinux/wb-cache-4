40|$|Abstract—The {{principle}} of the thread fastenings have been known and used for decades. Its long applications become to a common manufacturing {{with the purpose of}} joining one component to another. Recently, the thread fastenings are a common assembly method, which is widely used and popularly applied. Because of the thread fastenings can be permitted easy to reassembly and disassembly for maintenance, repair, relocation, and recycling. Screw insertions are typically carried out manually with having the purpose of joining one component to another. Its is more complex to automate, and hence has admitted relatively very small research attention on automating threaded fastenings, and most automated assembly research is focused on the peg-in-hole assembly problem. This paper investigates the problem of an intelligence control strategy for automated <b>Threaded</b> <b>Fastening</b> process based on an analytical model and on-line parameter estimation. The monitoring problem deals with predicting the integrity of the self-tapping <b>Threaded</b> <b>Fastening</b> process, based on the torque vs. insertion angle curves generated during the insertions. A technique for estimating three unknown parameters during a general self-tapping <b>Threaded</b> <b>Fastening</b> is presented. It is shown that these parameters, required by the mathematical model, can be reliably estimated on-line. Test results are presented to validate procedure. batch production. The approach adopted in this study is to use an analytical model developed by the authors [1 - 4] to predict ideal insertion signals. However, this model requires various fixed process parameters as input, and it is not always possible to know these parameters in advance with sufficient accuracy. Hence the focus of this paper is the on-line parameter estimation during threaded assembly. II. THE <b>THREADED</b> <b>FASTENING</b> PROCESS A. Self-tapping Screw Insertions In [1 - 4] the <b>Threaded</b> <b>Fastening</b> process is described by a torque signature signal.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{to connect the}} supporting portions of orthopaedic implants {{such as in the}} head, spine, upper limb and lower limb and thereby prevent loosening and fretting at the implant interface of an orthopaedic implant construct has been developed based on shape memory effect and super-elasticity of shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium (nitinol or NiTi) shape-memory-alloy, without the use of typical <b>threaded</b> <b>fastening</b> technique. Advantages are conferred by making the entire device, not just connecting pieces, out of shape memory alloy and having shape memory effect and super-elasticity. Heating the memory head of the device will compress the connection portion without the use of an auxiliary device (e. g. coupling member) so that the connection portion can be completely clamped down by the memory head. Further advantages are provided {{through the use of a}} two-way shape memory effect in which the memory device can be closed or tightened by heating up the ambient temperature, and re-opened by cooling down the temperature. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Over the past two decades, {{a major part of}} the manufacturing and assembly market has been driven by its customer requirements. Increasing customer demand for personalised products create the demand for smaller batch sizes, shorter production times, lower costs, and the flexibility to produce families of products - or different parts - with the same sets of equipment. Consequently, manufacturing companies have deployed various automation systems and production strategies to improve their resource efficiency and move towards right-first-time production. However, many of these automated systems, which are involved with robot-based, repeatable assembly automation, require component- specific fixtures for accurate positioning and extensive robot programming, to achieve flexibility in their production. <b>Threaded</b> <b>fastening</b> operations are widely used in assembly. In high-volume production, the fastening processes are commonly automated using jigs, fixtures, and semi-automated tools. This form of automation delivers reliable assembly results at the expense of flexibility and requires component variability to be adequately controlled. On the other hand, in low- volume, high- value manufacturing, fastening processes are typically carried out manually by skilled workers. This research is aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues by developing a freeform automated threaded fastener assembly system that uses 3 D visual guidance. The proof-of-concept system developed focuses on picking up fasteners from clutter, identifying a hole feature in an imprecisely positioned target component and carry out torque-controlled fastening. This approach has achieved flexibility and adaptability without the use of dedicated fixtures and robot programming. This research also investigates and evaluates different 3 D imaging technology to identify the suitable technology required for fastener assembly in a non-structured industrial environment. The proposed solution utilises the commercially available technologies to enhance the precision and speed of identification of components for assembly processes, thereby improving and validating the possibility of reliably implementing this solution for industrial applications. As a part of this research, a number of novel algorithms are developed to robustly identify assembly components located in a random environment by enhancing the existing methods and technologies within the domain of the fastening processes. A bolt identification algorithm was developed to identify bolts located in a random clutter by enhancing the existing surface-based matching algorithm. A novel hole feature identification algorithm was developed to detect threaded holes and identify its size and location in 3 D. The developed bolt and feature identification algorithms are robust and has sub-millimetre accuracy required to perform successful fastener assembly in industrial conditions. In addition, the processing time required for these identification algorithms - to identify and localise bolts and hole features - is less than a second, thereby increasing the speed of fastener assembly...|$|E
40|$|Phase I: The use of {{adhesive}} locking features or liquid locking compounds (LLCs) (e. g., Loctite) as a {{means of}} providing a secondary locking feature has been used on NASA programs since the Apollo program. In many cases Loctite was used as a last resort when (a) self-locking fasteners were no longer functioning per their respective drawing specification, (b) access was limited for removal & replacement, or (c) replacement could not be accomplished without severe impact to schedule. Long-term use of Loctite became inevitable in cases where removal and replacement of worn hardware was not cost effective and Loctite was assumed to be fully cured and working. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) and United Space Alliance (USA) recognized the need for more extensive testing of Loctite grades to better understand their capabilities and limitations as a secondary locking feature. These tests, identified as Phase I, were designed to identify processing sensitivities, to determine proper cure time, the correct primer to use on aerospace nutplate, insert and bolt materials such as A 286 and MP 35 N, and the minimum amount of Loctite that is required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. The. 1900 - 32 was the fastener size tested, due to wide usage in the aerospace industry. Three different grades of Loctite were tested. Results indicate that, with proper controls, adhesive locking features can be successfully used in the repair of locking features and should be considered for design. Phase II: <b>Threaded</b> <b>fastening</b> systems used in aerospace programs typically have a requirement for a redundant locking feature. The primary locking method is the fastener preload and the traditional redundant locking feature is a self-locking mechanical device that may include deformed threads, non-metallic inserts, split beam features, or other methods that impede movement between threaded members. The self-locking resistance of traditional locking features can be directly verified during assembly by measuring the dynamic prevailing torque. Adhesive locking features or LLCs are another method of providing redundant locking, but a direct verification method has not been used in aerospace applications to verify proper installation when using LLCs because of concern for damage to the adhesive bond. The reliability of LLCs has also been questioned due to failures observed during testing with coupons for process verification, although the coupon failures have often been attributed to a lack of proper procedures. It is highly desirable to have a direct method of verifying the LLC cure or bond integrity. The purpose of the Phase II test program was to determine if the torque applied during direct verification of an adhesive locking feature degrades that locking feature. This report documents the test program used to investigate the viability of such a direct verification method. Results of the Phase II testing were positive, and additional investigation of direct verification of adhesive locking features is merited...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the loosening tendency of a threaded fastener. To achieve the objective, the threaded fastener looseness model is constructed through the following procedures. Firstly, static and dynamic threaded fastener models are derived to find the static and dynamic interior forces respectively. Secondly, for investigating the bolt loosening behaviour, the effects of thread lead angle, initial preload, vibration frequency, and the nature of material on the bolt looseness, the threaded fastener looseness model is constructed by combining the above models with a Karnopp frictional model. The proposed approach not only analyses both the static and the dynamic behaviours of the bolt as well as the bolt loosening but also detects whether the bolt is within the elastic range or not. The approach can serve as a guide for designing a <b>thread</b> <b>fastening</b> procedure to avoid the failure of threaded fasteners due to vibration...|$|R

So, by the help of his thread, he tried to mount upwards, but he could go such a little way, and hurt himself dreadfully when he tumbled back to earth again.

The whole costume, though quite simple in style, a compromise either for afternoon or evening, was charming in its novelty, charming too in the way it permitted the utmost liberty and variety of movement to the lithe limbs of its wearer. But it was her face particularly that struck Alan Merrick at first sight. That face was above all things the face of a free woman. Something so frank and fearless shone in Herminia's glance, as her eye met his, that Alan, who respected human freedom above all other qualities in man or woman, was taken on the spot by its perfect air of untrammelled liberty. Yet it was subtle and beautiful too, undeniably beautiful. Herminia Barton's features, I think, were even more striking in their way in later life, when sorrow had stamped her, and the mark of her willing martyrdom for humanity's sake was deeply printed upon them. But their beauty then was the beauty of holiness, which not all can appreciate. In her younger days, as Alan Merrick first saw her, she was beautiful still with the first flush of health and strength and womanhood in a free and vigorous English girl's body. A certain lofty serenity, not untouched with pathos, seemed to strike the keynote. But that was not all. Some hint of every element in the highest loveliness met in that face and form,--physical, intellectual, emotional, moral.|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} are responsible assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and threaded connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than <b>thread</b> wear while <b>fastening.</b> According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods threaded connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R
60|$|In {{building}} their webs, {{as in many}} other small points, Lucy and Eliza showed from the first no inconsiderable personal differences. Lucy began hers by spinning a long line from her spinnerets, and letting the wind carry it wherever it would; while Eliza, more architectural in character, preferred to take her lines personally from point to point, and see herself to their proper fastening. In either case, however, the first thing done was to stretch some eight or ten stout threads from place to place {{on the outside of the}} future web, to act as points d'appuy for the remainder of the structure. To these outer threads, which the spiders strengthened so as to bear a considerable strain by doubling and trebling them, other thinner single threads were then carried radially at irregular distances, like the spokes of a wheel, from a point in the centre, where they were all made fast and connected together. As soon as this radiating framework or scaffolding was finished, like the woof on a loom, the industrious craftswoman started at the middle, and began the task of putting in the cross-pieces or weft which were to complete and bind together the circular pattern. These she wove round and round in a continuous spiral, setting out at the centre, and keeping on in ever-widening circlets, till she arrived at last at the exterior or foundation <b>threads.</b> How she <b>fastened</b> these cross-pieces to the ray-lines I could never quite make out, though I often followed the work closely from inside through the pane of glass with a platyscopic lens; for, strange to say, the spiders were not in the least disturbed by being watched at their work, and never took the slightest notice of anything that went on at the other side of the window. My impression is, however, that she gummed them together, letting them harden into one as they dried; for the thread itself is always semi-liquid when first exuded.|$|R

6000|$|After {{dinner the}} ball began, {{and it was}} the strangest ball that ever was seen. The trumpeter Gadfly and a number of his relations, besides several Grasshoppers and Bees, were the chief musicians. They wanted a bass very much at first, but the Bull-frog offered his services, {{although}} he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone. Then the gentlemen drew on their gloves, flattened their wings, pulled up their collars, and coiled away their tails; while the ladies tightened their garters, ruffled their feathers, and put out their feelers. Oh how they did dance! reels were nothing to it. The greatest difficulty was to keep the Grasshoppers in order. They became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment, and so lost their partners, and ran against everybody in searching for them. Then the Bull-frog, who sang bass, got a little too much of the dew, and sang so loudly, that he quite drowned all the other players. So Mrs Butterfly put her claws in her ears, and running up to him, said, [...] "Oh! dear Mr Bull-frog, pray do not sing quite so loudly." [...] The poor Bull-frog was almost weeping with joy at the merry scene before him, but he blushed very green on hearing this, and said he had forgotten what he was doing, but would try to be more careful. However, in five minutes more he was worse than ever, so they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him, and try to keep him in order. In the middle of all this there was a sudden stop, and a Snail, stepping forward, offered to dance a minuet. This was received with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail, half frightened, half angry, drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot, and the dance was begun anew. By this time the Gnats and Midges, {{and some of the other}} flies, had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air. Two or three Spiders mounted up into the oak, and <b>fastened</b> <b>threads</b> to some of the branches, by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers, and, seizing their partners round the waist, carried them screaming in among the leaves. So the fun and the noise became louder and louder. On the ground, under the bushes, among the branches of the trees, and in the air, the dancers bounded, skipped, laughed, sang, shouted, and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before. The merry old Bull-frog became quite absurd. He sang and roared like a lion; took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them; tumbled over the other musicians, and, in short, did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddock-stool, where they left him to enjoy himself.|$|R
