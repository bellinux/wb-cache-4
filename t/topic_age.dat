40|$|Research into {{emergent}} literacy {{has increased}} the awareness {{of the importance of}} early literacy experiences. Many studies have shown that individual differences in the emergent literacy components of phonological sensitivity, print knowledge, and oral language affect a child 2 ̆ 7 s future success in reading. These studies often focus on predicting future success from past abilities. From a sociocultural perspective, this study attempted to look at the child 2 ̆ 7 s environment and examine the context in which literacy development occurs. Transcribed conversations from the CHILDES database, a computer based storehouse of conversations transcribed by language researchers for use by other researchers, was used to determine if there were group level differences in the proportion of literacy words spoken by the mothers and their children. The conversations used in the analysis included children ages 3, 5, or 6, and their parents talking in a naturalistic setting (typically the home) without any prompting of conversation <b>topic.</b> <b>Age</b> of the child, gender of the child, and socioeconomic status were the group level variables of interest. Socioeconomic status was found to be significantly related to the proportion of literacy words spoken at home. This suggests that the mechanism behind the differences in emergent literacy seen in children from varying socioeconomic levels may be the amount of talk about literacy in the home, which could be viewed as the literacy culture of the family. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar parte da produção de conhecimento da área dos Distúrbios da Comunicação. MÉTODOS: Análise dos artigos publicados nos periódicos: Revista de Distúrbios da Comunicação; Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia; Revista Fonoatual e Revista Pró-fono, no período de 2000 a 2005. Variáveis examinadas: temática, faixa etária do público alvo, tipo de intervenção e contexto institucional. RESULTADOS: Foram publicados 724 artigos. A temática mais pesquisada, de forma isolada ou combinada, foi Linguagem Oral (282), seguida de Audiologia (232), Motricidade Oral (91) e Voz (62). A faixa etária mais estudada foi de três a dez anos (145). A atuação de diagnosticar e/ou avaliar foi a mais relatada (547), em contexto clínico (542), escolar (63) e hospitalar (32). CONCLUSÃO: Esses números refletem o aumento das publicações desses periódicos. Há necessidade de uma distribuição mais equilibrada das temáticas, faixas etárias, tipos de intervenções e contextos institucionais nas produções da área. Novos estudos em torno da produção do conhecimento devem ser realizados visando o registro histórico do que tem sido pesquisado e a definição de ações e campos estratégicos para o implemento da pesquisa na área. PURPOSE: To analyze {{part of the}} {{knowledge}} production {{in the field of}} Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology. METHODS: The articles published in the following journals from the year 2000 to 2005 were analyzed: Revista de Distúrbios da Comunicação; Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia; Revista Fonoatual and Revista Pró-fono. The studied variables were: <b>topic,</b> <b>age</b> range of the studied population, type of intervention, and institutional context. RESULTS: Seven hundred and twenty four articles were published during the period analyzed. The prevailing subject, either individually or in combination with other topics, was Oral Language (282), followed by Audiology (232), Orofacial Myology (91) and Voice (62). The prevailing age range studied was children from three to ten years old (145). Diagnosis and/or evaluation was the most mentioned type of intervention (547), in clinical (542), school (63) and hospital (32) contexts. CONCLUSION: Results reflected an increase of publications in the area during the studied period. The need for a more balanced distribution of topics, age groups, types of intervention, and institutional contexts in future publications is discussed. Further studies regarding knowledge production in the area would allow not only the historic registry of what has been investigated by speech-language therapists and audiologists, but also the definition of actions and strategic fields for implementing research in the area...|$|E
40|$|Social Network Sites (SNS) {{claim that}} they are "on a mission to connect the world". They {{facilitate}} communication among people wherever they are located. Consequently, many users of SNS communicate with a broad and heterogenic group of friends on different occasions and thereby express various aspects of their identities (such as gender, age, ethnic background etc.). One aspect {{may also be a}} local identity. Users of SNS can show their local identity linguistically by using a regional variety. Sometimes, the use of single regionally marked words or sporadic regiolectal spellings are sufficient to identify the regional background of the writer; in other cases entire text messages and conversations appear in dialectal spellings meaning that the dialect appears as the main variety of the conversation. The extent of dialect use in computer-mediated communication (CMC) may depend on various factors such as the individual dialect skills, the vividness and prestige of the respective dialect in the community, emotional involvement in the given <b>topic,</b> <b>age,</b> gender, the intended recipient, and other factors probably interacting with each other. The use of regional dialects in written CMC is one reason (amongst others) why language in CMC often differs from the respective standard languages. Since no orthographic rules are usually available for writing in dialect, {{it is up to the}} users to represent their dialect in a proper but readable and comprehensible way. Users have to construct their regiolectal language variety on the basis of the orthography of the respective standard language, which usually allows also for variation. One reason for this may be various adequate possibilities to represent a dialect word within a given writing system (e. g. German). Another reason may be the (sometimes very slight) phonetic differences between regionally close dialects that writers want (or do not want) to turn up in the dialect respelling. Therefore, dialect respellings are not always coherent (neither with respect to a group of dialect speakers nor with respect to individual writers) but usually appear in various forms. However, unifications of respellings in CMC are described for pidgin languages and also occur in dialectal CMC. Over the last decade, researchers started to compile corpora containing different genres of CMC. Such CMC corpora enable a systematic analysis of the way dialect features are reflected in written communication. In my talk, I will focus on patterns of the regional dialect(s) in the DiDi Corpus, a collection of Facebook messages from around 100 South Tyrolean writers. I will provide examples of regional features, analyse the distribution of such features, and discuss challenges of identifying local writings on SNS...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{reflects}} {{upon some}} of the issues arising from the author's experience of undertaking and supervising practice-centred research in relation to music performance. My research in this emerging field provides the background against which {{some of the}} diverse challenges that have arisen through the process of supervision are illuminated. In particular, this chapter will contrast two cases of students within the Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA), a program that has practice-based research at its core and which the author convened for its first few years since its introduction in 2005. The chapter is written in the form of personal reflections in conjunction with a form of narrative enquiry whereby issues that have arisen through personal experience are presented through fictionalised cases and situations. In particular the chapter contrasts the cases of two fictionalised students in the DMA whose personalities, backgrounds, musical experience and academic abilities present different challenges within an academic context. The emotional vulnerability of both student and supervisor is explored together with the challenges of negotiating both the professional and personal relationships when working with highly creative musicians within this context. This paper gives a fictionalised narrative account of my experience of supervising two students through the Doctor of Musical Arts program. The context is that of my own work environment at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University in Brisbane, where I have been supervising postgraduate research for over a decade. I was convenor of both the Master of Music and Doctor of Musical Arts when they were established as Higher Degree Research programs at our institution, and have supervised students through to completion in these {{as well as in the}} Ph. D program. The student cases discussed in this narrative are fictionalised. Though some aspects of them may reflect interactions with specific students I have known, the two central characters of Christina and Michael have been developed to reflect contrasting responses to various factors that arise through doctoral candidature. I hope that these fictionalised cases can shed some light on the nature of the experience for many research students as well as some of the significant differences in the way a supervisor may work with individual students at this level. Many factors have a significant bearing upon the supervisory relationship, including a candidate's research background, research <b>topic,</b> <b>age,</b> personality, ability to deal with criticism, as well as their personal circumstances and motivations. Of course different supervisors will approach the challenges of supervision differently and I do not intend to suggest that my approach to the task is in any sense exemplary. Nonetheless it is hoped that it may provide some insight into the complexity of the issues involved, the very real challenges that arise throughout the process, as well as the deeply satisfying sense of achievement that can come from the experience.
