40|$|Abstract: Thermal {{and powder}} {{densification}} modelling of the {{selective laser sintering}} of amorphous polycarbonate is reported. Three strategies have been investigated: analytical, adaptive mesh finite difference and fixed mesh finite element. A comparison between the three and experimental results is used to evaluate their ability reliably to predict the behaviour of the physical process. The finite difference and finite element approaches {{are the only ones}} that automatically deal with the non-linearities of the physical process that arise from the variation in the thermal properties of the polymer with density during sintering, but the analytical model has some value, provided appropri-ate mean values are used for thermal properties. Analysis shows that the densification and linear accuracies due to sintering are most sensitive to changes in the activation energy and heat capacity of the polymer, with a second level of sensitivities that includes powder bed density and powder layer thickness. Simulations of the manufacture of hollow cylinders and <b>T-pieces</b> show feature distortions due to excessive depth of sintering at downward facing surfaces in the powder bed.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods to}} determine additional loads bolts susceptible to fatigue-T connections. The {{reason for this}} exercise is the desire to increase the level of knowledge in this area. There is very little in literature and standards on this subject. The target {{of the study was}} to gain overview of existing formulas to calculate prying forces in T-connections subjected to dynamic loads. The results should be compared against analysis in Ansys Workbench. If possible, it would also be prepared separate formulas that would be verified against Ansys Workbench. It should also draw up a supervisor who showed step by step how an analysis of additional forces could be estimated in Ansys Workbench. It has been carried out literature studies of screw charts, calculations of prying forces and fatigue standards to get an overview of the effects that affected screw. To test out theories it have been set up models in Ansys. These have been tried up against theory of both prying forces and screw chart. The studies of the screw charts has led to two main theories. One calculating the compressed parts using pressure cone, Shigly [2] and the other uses a cylinder, Waløen [1]. It turns out that the theory that uses pressure cone coincides best with Ansys results. This is also much more complicated to use. Evidence indicates that Ansys analysis is very conservative, yet both methods fall conservatively into practice. Evidence indicates that, since the method of cylinder is mostly used in Norway. The studies of prying forces has headed to two equations which predict prying forces and the smallest flange thickness these formulas apply. The formulas are very similar in their structure, but one is more conservative than the other. It's just the most conservative formula that provides opportunities for fatigue analysis. These fatigue analysis is also little nuanced and provides only the result that says less than 20, 000 cycles, between 20, 000 and 500, 000 and over 500, 000 cycles, screw guide [3]. From these data, it constructed a fatigue curve to compare with Ansys analyzes. These comparisons do not coincide very well. More factors than prying forces play a role when we look at fatigue. By prying forces we also get a bending effect in the screw. This often generate bending stresses which give almost equally large changes inn stress range in many cases, as prying forces alone. Of fatigue standards it has been looked in to DNV-RP-C 203 [6] and EN 1993 - 1 - 9 [5]. The literature does not say anything about witch fatigue curve that is suitable if you have prying forces. DNV-RP-C 203; W 2 and EN 1993 - 1 - 9; 40 is used in this report. These curves are also almost identical. The formulas for prying forces don’t say anything about stress range. It is actually stress range who is used in the fatigue standards. It's also bean created formulas to calculate the lifetime of bolts by susceptible to fatigue <b>T-pieces</b> based on the formulas that have been examined in the report. This formula publishes stress range, so it can be used with fatigue standards. The result of the comparison with Ansys, gives a curve on the conservative side. This formulas is very extensive and complicated, so it is relatively easy to get a calculation error along the way. Finally, it has bean produced a guide to determine stress range in Ansys. The model in this guide is design so all dimensions can be changed easily inside Ansys. This makes it possible to calculate models with other dimensions than the model initially...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{degradation}} by electrochemical oxidation via boron doped diamond (BDD) was assessed for the selected pharmaceutical compounds iopromide (IOP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and diclofenac (DCF) in simulated wastewater (SWW) and real hospital effluent wastewater (RWW). The {{influence of the}} applied current, the flow rate through the electrochemical cell, the initial compound concentration and the wastewater matrix (SWW versus RWW) was evaluated. This study confirmed that the degradation has pseudo first-order reaction kinetics for all experimental conditions tested. It was shown that SMX, EE 2 and DCF degraded readily in SWW and RWW, however, the degradation of IOP was considerably slower, which is in agreement with previously reported slow degradation kinetics using typical advanced oxidation processes. Activation energies for the degradation reactions were calculated and it was shown that the flow rate in the electrochemical cell only had a moderate effect on the degradation rate of EE 2 and DCF. In contrast, the applied current had a major effect. The BDD electrochemical oxidation was shown {{to be an effective}} technique for removing pharmaceutical components from the effluent of a biological hospital wastewater treatment plant. However, the slower degradation of generally more hydrophilic transformation products should be taken into account when a full mineralization and a toxicity screening of the pharmaceuticals is pursued. This study sparked the interest for the analysis of samples with increasing complexity. Appropriate analytical methods to evaluate the presence, metabolism, degradation and removal efficiency of specific compounds were necessary for this purpose. Therefore, a generic methodology was developed to overcome the need for multiple analyses on complementary columns to cover the separation of all compounds due to large differences in polarity. A commercially available ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system was equipped with two external switching valves to connect hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) columns in series for the sequential analysis of polar and non-polar compounds. The principle relies on the isolation of unretained peaks eluting from a first dimension column in a sample loop, before directing them to a second column for separation. The setup was successfully applied for the separation of 32 pharmaceutical compounds {{with a wide range of}} polarities. Since the mobile phases employed in highly orthogonal separations were not directly compatible, a mixing unit was required to alter the mobile phase composition before executing the second dimension separation. To deal with the incompatibility of the HILIC eluate and the ensuing RPLC separation, in first instance commercially available mixers were included in the setup. Later, a novel mixing unit was proposed, based on the use of two restriction capillaries with different flow resistances to dilute the mobile phase eluting from the first dimension with a solvent appropriate for the second dimension separation. The restriction capillaries were implemented using three high-pressure switching valves and two <b>T-pieces.</b> It was demonstrated that the dilution ratio can be adequately predicted using the law of Hagen-Poiseuille and can be adjusted easily by changing the dimensions of the restriction capillaries. The dilution volume required to obtain acceptable recoveries was investigated and the use of different column diameters in the first and second dimension was proposed to increase the sensitivity of the analysis. Under optimum dilution conditions, recoveries ranging between 82 % and 99 % were always obtained, while repeatability values were excellent. The proof-of-concept of the different setups was demonstrated for the separation of 20 pharmaceuticals with log D-values ranging between – 5. 75 and 4. 22. Since information about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in water is scarce and pharmaceuticals are typically only present in the µg/L to ng/L range in European waterways, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure combining hydrophilic lipophilic balanced and strong cation exchange sorbents allowing the simultaneous extraction of polar and non-polar pharmaceuticals from simulated wastewater was evaluated. Besides for metformin that could not be eluted from the SPE cartridge and ticlopidine that could not adequately be extracted, good recovery rates between 75 % and 106 % were obtained for all studied compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of the presented setup in routine water analysis, further research is required to validate the entire methodology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{literature}} lacks {{comparative data}} on nebulizer aerosol delivered via mask versus <b>T-piece,</b> to spontaneously breathing pediatric subjects. PURPOSE: To compare total inhaled drug mass delivered via standard pediatric aerosol mask versus via <b>T-piece,</b> with increasing distance. METHODS: We used {{a sample of}} 5 nebulizers, operated under manufacturers ’ conditions, with a standard pediatric aerosol mask and with a <b>T-piece</b> capped at one end, at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm from an inhalation filter placed at the inlet of a pediatric test lung. Inhaled drug mass was analyzed with spectrophotometry. Aerosol particle size was measured separately from the breathing simulations, using a laser particle sizer to determine fine-particle mass (particles < 4. 7 m) and fine-particle fraction as percent of total mass. The fine-particle fraction was used to estimate the fine-particle mass. RESULTS: The mean SD values for inhaled drug mass {{as a percentage of}} nominal dose, at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm, with the mask were 2. 88 0. 79 %, 1. 61 0. 65 %, and 1. 3 0. 42 %, respectively, and with the <b>T-piece</b> were 4. 14 1. 37 %, 3. 77 1. 04 %, and 3. 47 0. 64 %, respectively. There was a statistically greater inhaled drug mass with <b>T-piece</b> than with mask, overall (p< 0. 01), and a significant decrease with mask or <b>T-piece</b> as distance increased (p < 0. 01). The difference between mask and <b>T-piece</b> for inhaled drug mass at 2 cm was statistically significant (p < 0. 018).

METHODS: Retrospective data were collected in 2 time periods. Primary outcome was overall response to resuscitation, as measured by Apgar score. Secondary outcomes were incidence of air leaks, need for chest compressions/epinephrine, need for intubation, and surfactant use. RESULTS: We identified 294 resuscitations requiring ventilation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nebulizers are {{a popular}} means of {{delivering}} aerosolized medication, primarily albuterol, to the bronchial airways of patients, {{and there has}} been extensive research done on numerous nebulizers used with nebulizer T-pieces and corrugated tubing. Very little research has been performed on other types of nebulizer delivery systems and there is no substantial information on how effective various nebulizer delivery systems are in terms of the quantity and particle size of aerosolized medication delivered to the patient. In this study the Circulaire and the AeroTee, two devices that rely on bags to store aerosol during patient exhalation, are evaluated and compared to the conventional nebulizer <b>T-piece</b> with corrugated tubing. METHODS: Three each of the nebu-lizer <b>T-piece</b> with corrugated tubing, the Circulaire, and the AeroTee were sampled using 3 Vixone nebulizers. Each one of the 3 nebulizer delivery systems used the same 3 Vixone nebulizers. Each nebulizer delivery system was evaluated by connecting a constant-flow vacuum and compressed gas source cycled to simulate patient breathing at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min and an inspi-ration-expiration ratio of 1 : 2. Medication delivered was determined by sampling a portion of the simulated patient’s flow onto a membrane filter and calculating the total medication received by the patient. Particle size was determined by sampling with a cascade impactor under ambient condi-tions. RESULTS: The Circulaire delivered significantly less medication than the nebulizer <b>T-piece</b> with corrugated tubing (p < 0. 001), whereas the AeroTee delivered substantially more medication than the nebulizer <b>T-piece</b> with corrugated tubing (p < 0. 001).

40|$|AIM: To {{review the}} {{literature}} surrounding {{various aspects of}} <b>T-piece</b> resuscitator use, with particular emphasis on the evidence comparing the device to other manual ventilation devices in neonatal resuscitation. DATA SOURCES: The Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane databases were searched in April 2011. Ongoing trials were identified using www. clinicaltrials. gov and www. controlled-trials. com. Additional studies from reference lists of eligible articles were considered. All studies including <b>T-piece</b> resuscitator use were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. There were two randomised controlled trials in newborn infants comparing the devices, one of which addressed short and intermediate term morbidity and mortality outcomes and found {{no difference between the}} <b>T-piece</b> resuscitator and self inflating bag. From manikin studies, advantages to the <b>T-piece</b> resuscitator include the delivery of inflating pressures closer to predetermined target pressures with least variation, the ability to provide prolonged inflation breaths and more consistent tidal volumes. Disadvantages include a technically more difficult setup, more time required to adjust pressures during resuscitation, a larger mask leak and less ability to detect changes in compliance.

40|$|Intermittent {{positive}} pressure ventilation (IPPV) using {{a manual}} ventilation device {{is one of}} the most commonly performed interventions in neonatal medicine. Applied peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and tidal volumes (TV) are highly variable, bearing the risk of ventilator induced lung injury. Additionally, positive end-expiratory pressure was shown to be lung protective. The aim was to assess the combined influence of operator and device specific influences on respiratory parameters in order to guarantee a lung protective management. We used simulated resuscitation scenario using a neonatal manikin approximating a 1 -kg preterm infant. A respiratory function monitor was fitted at the interface between mannequin and resuscitation device to: 1) measure PIP and TV application using a self-inflating bag compared to a <b>T-piece</b> device 2) to compare the influence of operator skills assessed by a questionnaire to applied PIP and TV, and 3) to assess the ability to consistently generate PEEP in self-inflating bags compared to T-piece-devices. Using the self-inflating bag PIP and TV were significantly higher compared to the <b>T-piece</b> device: median PIP was 25. 6 cmH 2 O vs. 19. 7 cmH 2 O (p< 0. 001); median TV was 5. 1 vs. 3. 6 ml (p< 0. 001). Using a self-inflating bag PIP and TV were highly dependent on operator specific skills. In contrast PIP and TV application did not depend on operator specific skills using a T-piece-device. Using the self-inflating bag PEEP was significantly lower compared to the <b>T-piece</b> device: mean PEEP was 2. 95 vs. 5. 59 cmH 2 O. When using self-inflating bags excessive high PIP and TV were recorded, while PEEP levels do not reach the requirements. Operator training level and device-specific experience had a significant impact on PIP and VT provision when using SI-bags for manual ventilation, but not in <b>T-piece</b> devices.

The results indicated that the most widely used mechanical ventilation weaning procedures were <b>T-piece</b> once daily trial in 22 patients (44 %), continous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in 40 %, <b>T-piece</b> intermittent trial in 10 %, and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in 6 %. Mechanical ventilation weaning success rate was 88 % and the failure rate was 12 % (6 patients) which required re-intubation.

40|$|Background Inhalational {{induction}} {{in children}} is easiest to perform with the Ayres <b>t-piece</b> and bag (Mapleson F). Drawover anesthesia systems {{may be used}} but have not been studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the quality of induction of anesthesia in children comparing a continuous flow system using the Farman entrainer and the pediatric <b>t-piece,</b> to a pediatric drawover system. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial in accordance with departmental and institutional standards with 60 subjects who received inhalational induction using either apparatus. Results There was no evidence of a difference in the median Sp 02 between the two methods (P =  0. 626) neither was there a difference between the method of induction regarding abdominal distension (P =  0. 348) or restraint (P =  0. 186). Induction time using the pediatric drawover apparatus 240 (range 115 – 605) seconds was significantly greater than the Farman entrainer/t-piece 146 (range 65 – 535) seconds (P &# 60;  0. 05). Conclusions We consider that this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant in many cases; however, the increased speed using the entrainer and <b>t-piece</b> may sometimes confer an advantage. </p...|$|E
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Albuterol {{delivery}} {{through a}} tracheostomy tube {{is affected by}} device (nebulizer vs metered-dose inhaler), interface (mask vs <b>T-piece),</b> bias flow, and humidification. METHODS: A lift bar was placed between the chambers of a dual-chambered lung model such that a ventilator triggered simulated spontaneous breathing {{at a rate of}} 20 breaths/min, tidal volume of 0. 4 L, and inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1 : 2. An 8 -mm inner diameter cuffed tracheostomy tube was placed through a semi-circular model that simulated a patient’s neck. Four conditions of gas flow and humidification were used for the nebulizer experiments: heated aerosol (approximately 30 L/min, approximately 30 °C), heated humidity (approximately 30 L/min, approximately 30 °C), high flow without added humidity (approximately 30 L/min), or a nebulizer attached to the tracheostomy tube without additional flow. The nebulizer was filled with 4 mL that contained 2. 5 mg of albuterol, and operated at 8 L/min. The nebulizer was tested with a <b>T-piece</b> or tracheostomy mask. For the metered-dose inhaler experiments, a spacer was used and actuation of the inhaler (100 g per actuation) was synchronized with inhalation (4 actuations separated by> 15 s). When the spacer was used without additional flow, a valved <b>T-piece</b> was used with a 1 -way valve placed either proximal or distal to the spacer. A filter was attached between the lung model and the distal end of the tracheostomy tube. Albuterol washed from the filter was measured by ultraviolet spectropho-tometry. RESULTS: For the nebulizer, the most efficient delivery was with no flow other than that to power the nebulizer and with a <b>T-piece</b> (p < 0. 001). The most efficient method for aerosol delivery was metered-dose inhaler with a valved <b>T-piece</b> and placement of the 1 -way valve in the proximal position (p < 0. 001). The effect of humidity was unclear from the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Albuterol delivery via tracheostomy was affected by the delivery device (nebu-lizer vs inhaler), bias gas flow, and the patient interface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigorous numerical {{investigation into the}} structural response of a composite laminate <b>T-piece</b> specimen subjected to a mechanical "pull-off" load case. Initially, a linear elastic stress analysis is conducted, showing very high stresses at the free-edge. In a further analysis, special-purpose interface elements are then inserted where appropriate and used to predict both the crack pattern and the load to failure. It is demonstrated that that using realistic cohesive maximum strength values requires a very fine mesh. Reducing the values to ensure initiation occurs leads to conservative and mesh independent predictions and that a suitable choice leads to good correlation with the experimental results. This study also shows that the <b>T-piece</b> failure is controlled by crack propagation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Diaphragm {{ultrasound}} (DUS) is {{a well-established}} {{point of care}} modality for assessment of dimensional and functional aspects of the diaphragm. Amongst various measures, diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTf) is more comprehensive. However, there is still uncertainty about its capability to predict {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} (MV). The present prospective observational exploratory study assessed the diaphragm at variable negative pressure triggers (NPTs) with US to predict weaning in ICU patients. Methods Adult ICU patients about to receive their first <b>T-piece</b> were included in the study. Linear and curvilinear US probes were used to measure right side diaphragm characteristics first at pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 8  cmH 2 O with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5  cmH 2 O against NPTs of 2, 4, and 6  cmH 2 O and then later during their first <b>T-piece.</b> The measured variables were then categorized into simple weaning (SW) and complicated weaning (CW) groups and their outcomes analyzed. Results Sixty-four (M:F, 40 : 24) medical (55 / 64, 86 %) patients were included in the study. Sepsis of lung origin (65. 5 %) was the dominant reason for MV. There were 33 and 31 patients in the SW and CW groups, respectively. DTf predicts SW with a cutoff ≥[*] 25. 5, 26. 5, 25. 5, and 24. 5 for 2, 4, and 6 NPTs and <b>T-piece,</b> respectively, with ≥[*] 0. 90 ROC AUC. At NPT of 2, DTf had the highest sensitivity of 97 % and specificity of 81 % [ROC AUC (CI), 0. 91 (0. 84 – 0. 99); p[*]<[*] 0. 001]. Conclusions DTf may successfully predict SW and also help identify patients ready to wean prior to a <b>T-piece</b> trial...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{the limits of}} performance of the Farman Entrainer used with the <b>t-piece</b> for pediatric anesthesia in areas with limited oxygen supplies. Methods Bench tests were conducted with different system configurations, normal and ‘emergency situation’ ventilation patterns were replicated to reproduce a range of circumstances the anesthetist may encounter. Results We found that Fi 02 rises and flow decreases with increasing CPAP, but probably within safe limits. A one way valve is essential to avoid high concentration of volatile agent. Very high ventilation rates reduce flow significantly. Increasing oxygen input from an oxygen concentrator increases the flow output but does not increase Fi 02. Conclusion The basic characteristics of the system are within normally accepted parameters for <b>t-piece</b> anesthesia, safety in practice requires to be demonstrated by a clinical study. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} reporting {{factors influencing}} aerosol delivery in intubated patients {{has been largely}} focused on the endotracheal tube (ETT) during mechanical ventilation, with little comparative analysis of effect of types of artificial airways and their interfaces on aerosol delivery during spontaneous breathing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare aerosol delivery via tracheostomy tube (TT) and ETT, using interfaces such as <b>T-piece,</b> tracheostomy collar, and manual resuscitation bag. METHODS: A teaching manikin was intubated with either an ETT (8. 0 mm inner diameter) and TT (8 mm inner diameter). Both bronchi were connected to a collecting filter, attached to a sinusoidal pump simulating the breathing pattern of a spontaneously breathing adult (tidal volume 450 mL, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, inspiratory-expiratory ratio 1 : 2). Albuterol sulfate (2. 5 mg/ 3 mL) was nebulized through a jet nebulizer, using each airway and interface as appropriate (n 3). Drug on the filter was eluted and analyzed with spectrophotom-etry, and expressed as mean percent of loaded dose delivered. Descriptive statistics, the Student t test, and one-way analysis of variance were applied. RESULTS: A greater percentage of nominal dose was delivered via TT than ETT with both <b>T-piece</b> (13. 79 2. 59 % vs 9. 05 0. 70 %) and manual resuscitation bag (45. 75 1. 8 % vs 27. 23 8. 98 %, P. 038 and P. 025, respectively). Use of manual resuscitation bag with both TT and ETT increased lung dose more than 3 -fold. Inhaled dose with tracheostomy collar was (6. 92 0. 81 %) less than <b>T-piece</b> with TT (P. 01). CONCLUSION: In this adult model of spontaneous ventilation, aerosol therapy through ETT was less efficient than TT, while the manual resuscitation bag was more efficient than <b>T-piece</b> or tracheostomy collar.
