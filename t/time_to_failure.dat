2500|$|GEN-III OMNI-V - VII devices can {{differ from}} {{standard}} Generation 3 {{in one or}} both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions. The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the Standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2,850K of only 700, compared to operating with a luminous sensitivity of at least 1,800 for GEN III image intensifiers. [...] The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical 20,000 hrs mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> (MTTF) for Gen III type, to 15,000 hrs MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach 15,000 hrs of operation before replacement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{retirement}} {{life of the}} wing spar of a transport category aeroplane type-certificated to the safe-life principle {{is based on a}} safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. [...] The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this class of aeroplane. [...] A 50% reduction of mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its {{retirement life}}. In anticipation that the atmospheric gust spectrum in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the gust spectrum was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric gust spectrum these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSystem {{characteristics}} of a two-unit repairable system are studied from a Bayesian viewpoint with different types of priors assumed for unknown parameters, in which the service station is unreliable. <b>Times</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> and <b>times</b> <b>to</b> repair of the operating units are assumed to follow exponential distributions. In addition, failure times and repair times of the service station also follow exponential distributions. When <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> and <b>times</b> <b>to</b> repair of operating units, failure times and repair times of the service station are with uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> system <b>failure</b> and the steady-state availability.

2500|$|Vacuum tubes used as {{switches}} made electronic computing {{possible for}} the first time, but the cost and relatively short mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> of tubes were limiting factors. [...] "The common wisdom was that valves—which, like light bulbs, contained a hot glowing filament—could never be used satisfactorily in large numbers, for they were unreliable, and in a large installation too many would fail in too short a time". Tommy Flowers, who later designed Colossus, [...] "discovered that, so long as valves were switched on and left on, they could operate reliably for very long periods, especially if their 'heaters' were run on a reduced current". In 1934 Flowers built a successful experimental installation using over 3,000 tubes in small independent modules; when a tube failed, {{it was possible to}} switch off one module and keep the others going, thereby reducing the risk of another tube failure being caused; this installation was accepted by the Post Office (who operated telephone exchanges). Flowers was also a pioneer of using tubes as very fast (compared to electromechanical devices) electronic switches. Later work confirmed that tube unreliability was not as serious an issue as generally believed; the 1946 ENIAC, with over 17,000 tubes, had a tube failure (which took 15 minutes to locate) on average every two days. The quality of the tubes was a factor, and the diversion of skilled people during the Second World War lowered the general quality of tubes. During the war Colossus was instrumental in breaking German codes. After the war, development continued with tube-based computers including, military computers ENIAC and Whirlwind, the Ferranti Mark 1 (the first commercially available electronic computer), and UNIVAC I, also available commercially.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{testing of}} {{components in the}} automotive industry requires long testing times {{and the use of}} expensive facilities. To shorten these testing times an accelerated vibration-testing approach is usually applied. This research tries to shorten these testing times by considering the parameters that define vibration-testing techniques. With special attention to the excitation types sweep-sine and random, a damage-based approach is applied. The phenomenon of fatigue damage is closely observed from the frequency-domain point of view but also by considering the relationship between the time and the frequency domains. The Palmgren-Miner cumulative rule is applied to calculate the fatigue life.

Methods:Subjects completed 12 weeks of resistance training consisting of 36 sessions, using unilateral leg exercise. Sustained isometric knee extension performed at 50 % of maxmal force until task failure for the contralateral untrained leg. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals were simultaneously recorded from contralateral untrained quadriceps (vastusmedialis, rectus femoris, and vastuslateralis). Results: <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> task <b>failure</b> of the contralateraluntrained leg and associated EMG activitiessignificantly increased after 12 weeks ofunilateral resistance training(p< 0. 05).
