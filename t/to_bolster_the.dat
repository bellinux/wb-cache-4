5|$|Fearing {{that the}} U.S. troops {{were on the}} verge of {{breaking}} through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found on-hand <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around the south and west of Point Cruz.|$|E

5|$|In early 1941, German {{forces were}} {{deployed}} to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. In February, German forces arrived in Libya <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> Italian presence. In April, Hitler launched {{the invasion of}} Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece. In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi rebel forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.|$|E
5|$|The French {{had built}} nearby Logstown as a trade and council {{center for the}} Native Americans to {{increase}} their influence in the Ohio Valley. Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> French claim to the region. De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops were immediately dispatched to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military {{situation on the}} ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, with French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E
50|$|On October 5, 2010, the Oakland Raiders signed Davis {{to their}} active roster <b>to</b> help <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> team's injury-depleted linebacker corps. He was waived {{a year later}} on October 13, 2011.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>bolstering</b> <b>the</b> agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali {{built an}} industrial base for Egypt. His motivation {{for doing so}} was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced muskets and cannons. With a shipyard he built in Alexandria, he began construction of a navy. By {{the end of the}} 1830s, Egypt’s war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.|$|R
5|$|Besides championing the Southern {{cause in}} Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> state's {{support of the}} Confederacy. He presided over a {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Camp Burnett, a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of Clinton in Hickman County, Kentucky, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> aims of Fortitude North, {{and overall}} {{this aspect of the}} plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{continued}} with its limited objective attacks {{to expand their}} bridgeheads on the 4th Army front, including at Zákány. The resistance offered by both flanking divisions was very limited. The 36th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, which had been concentrating in the Ludbreg district northwest of Koprivnica, {{was transferred to the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> left flank of the divisional sector.|$|E

5|$|The Bahamas did {{not come}} under {{external}} threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 {{in an attempt to}} recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> new amendment, Grant {{relied on}} the army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South. Where the attorney general had once been only a legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|During 2004, Romney spent {{considerable}} effort trying <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> state Republican Party, but {{it failed}} to gain any seats in the state legislative elections that year. Given a prime-time appearance at the 2004 Republican National Convention, political figures began discussing him as a potential 2008 presidential candidate. Midway through his term, Romney decided {{that he wanted to}} stage a full-time run for president, and on December 14, 2005, announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term. As chair of the Republican Governors Association, Romney traveled around the country, meeting prominent Republicans and building a national political network; he spent all, or parts of, more than 200days out of state during 2006, preparing for his run.|$|E
5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished. Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed his colleagues to ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's leader <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> <b>the</b> new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak Moderate Party collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E
