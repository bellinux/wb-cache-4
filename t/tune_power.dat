40|$|Interconnected {{power systems}} {{are subject to}} low {{frequency}} oscillations. These oscillations, if poorly damped, threaten {{the stability of the}} system and limit its power transfer capability. Power System Stabilizers (PSS) are widely used to enhance the damping of electromechanical oscillatory modes. Conventional methods to <b>tune</b> <b>power</b> system stabilizers attempt to provide the required magnitude/phase shift compensation through frequency response or mode sensitivity analysis. However, these methods do not operate directly on the damping sensitivity of the mode. A novel method to calculate the damping sensitivity has been developed in this work. It operates on mode damping directly to achieve optimum damping for the under-damped oscillatory modes. The proposed method has been used to tune simple stabilizers for the well-known two-area four-machine power system problem and the IEEE 9 -Bus system. It is compared with results obtained from complex and robust PSS designs, and found to offer comparable outcomes...|$|E
40|$|An inter-area mode {{oriented}} pole-shifting method (named: IAMO-PS) with {{coordination of}} control efforts is proposed {{in this paper}} to <b>tune</b> <b>power</b> oscillation damping controllers under multiple operating conditions. Firstly, to provide incentives for developing IAMO-PS, a pole-shifting method (named: SCCS-PS), which tunes the controllers by moving all closed loop poles to a sequentially compressed conic section in the complex plane, is proposed to investigate impact of other modes on the control of inter-area modes. Thus, compared to SCCS-PS, a specific pole placement suitable for damping control of inter-area modes is implemented in IAMO-PS. Moreover, since a novel index is proposed to effectively measure control effort of the controller, IAMO-PS is capable of reasonably allocating the control burden among different controllers, which will be attractive for applications in practice. Optimization of both methods is solved by the efficient method of sequential quadratic programming, and a two-stage optimization procedure is proposed for IAMO-PS so that a feasible solution can be easily obtained in practical applications. Both methods are applied for control coordination in the New England and New York interconnected systems. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of IAMO-PS in robustly mitigating inter-area oscillations and coordinating control efforts, and some beneficial conclusions are also confirmed by comparing control results of the two methods.

A maximum of x′ = 0. 12 Br, where x′ is the Rietveld-refined value, can be substituted into the crystal structure with at least 2 % rutile TiO 2 forming as a second phase. Higher Br concentrations induced the formation of a third, presumably Br-rich, phase. These materials function as composite anodes that contain mixtures of TiO 2, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -xBrx, and a Br-rich third, unknown, phase. The minor quantities of the secondary phases in combination with Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -xBrx where x′ ∼ 0. 1 were found to correspond to the optimum in electrochemical properties, while larger quantities of the secondary phases contributed to the degradation of the performance. In situ neutron diffraction of a composite anatase TiO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode within a custom-built battery was used to determine the electrochemical function of the TiO 2 component. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 component was found to be electrochemically active at lower voltages (1. 5 V) relative to TiO 2 (1. 7 V). This enabled Li insertion/extraction to be tuned through the choice of voltage range in both components of this composite or in the anatase TiO 2 phase only.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in nanophotonic fabrication {{have made the}} optical network-on-chip an attractive interconnect option for next-generation multi-/many-core systems, providing high bandwidth and power efficiency. Both post-fabrication and runtime calibration of the optical components (ring resonators) are essential to building a robust optical communication system, as they are highly sensitive to process and thermal variation. Existing tuning methods based on bias voltage and temperature adjustment require excessive power to fully compensate for these variations. In this work, we propose a set of complementary techniques to address this challenge and significantly reduce the <b>tuning</b> <b>power</b> consumption: 1) a sub-channel remapping scheme to decrease the required tuning from the free spectral range (FSR) to less than one channel (typically less than 1 nm); 2) a transceiver-based network topology capable of building and tuning far fewer rings while maintaining the same system throughput.

5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the optical ring {{resonator}} and how it [...] "filters" [...] certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many optical ring resonators in series. This would allow for [...] "small size, low losses, and integrability into existing optical networks." [...] Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of mechanical sensor. If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions.The tuning process can be effected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic, electro-optic [...] or all-optical [...] effects. Electro-optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q microring are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of > 50 Gbit/s at cost of a <b>tuning</b> <b>power</b> to match wavelength of the light source.
