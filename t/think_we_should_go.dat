She says, “I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go.</b> It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E

In the car, Shehreyar says to Iqra [...] "You look good when you smile, [...] " [...] to which she responds [...] "In our society when a girl smiles, people take the wrong impression, therefore it is better not to smile. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> home now, the rain has also settled down a bit."At home, Aliya asks why Iqra came so late. When Iqra tells her, Aliya is furious, and asks her when she forbid her to come home with Ayaz on his bike, why {{she thought it was}} appropriate to come home with her male colleague.

Ayaz brought tea for Fouzia. Ayaz said how is tea? she said fine like everyday. Ayaz asked Had you meet Iqra? she said no. He said i meet.

6000|$|For {{some time}} Mrs. Proudie was much {{at a loss}} to know by what sort of party or {{entertainment}} she would make herself famous. Balls and suppers were of course out of the question. She did not object to her daughters dancing all night at other houses--at least, of late she had not objected, for the fashionable world required it, and the young ladies had perhaps a will of their own--but dancing at her house--absolutely under the shade of the bishop's apron--would be a sin and a scandal. And then as to suppers--of all modes in which one may extend one's hospitality to a large acquaintance, they are the most costly. [...] "It is horrid to <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> out among our friends for the mere sake of eating and drinking," [...] Mrs. Proudie would say to the clergymen's wives from Barsetshire. [...] "It shows such a sensual propensity." ...|$|R
5000|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid {{levels in the}} blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings ″do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.″ Researchers acknowledged that despite their results, further research is necessary, especially in people who are initially healthy. Until the picture becomes clearer, experts recommend people stick to the current guidelines on fat consumption. Indeed, Nita Forouhi, one of the coauthors of the meta-analysis, stated to the BBC that headlines proclaiming that [...] "butter is back" [...] are [...] "an oversimplification, we never said that" [...] and noted that the study {{was not able to}} distinguish between the differing effects of reducing saturated fat intake depending on what foods were used in substitute. [...] "While that research is going on I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> just <b>go</b> changing everything. It's too premature to give the public the impression that they have a licence, based on this preliminary research, which is exciting but not yet definitive, to say butter is back." ...|$|R

[...] It represents the best synthesis of our talents and if we were given the chance at a second album, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>gone</b> in this direction." [...] Dorothy Moskowitz, on the album in 2003 Inter band arguments about the direction of the group between Byrd {{and the rest of his}} band mates led the band to split up within months of the album's release. The United States of America was first released in 1968 on Columbia Records. The album spent nine weeks on the charts in the United States, peaking at number 181 on the Billboard album charts in May 1968. The album failed to chart in Britain. The album was reissued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1992 with two bonus tracks. In 1997, the album was re-issued in the United Kingdom on Edsel Records. On July 13, 2004 Sundazed Records re-issued the album on vinyl and compact disc with a new album cover from the original UK and Europe releases, and with the CD version containing 10 bonus tracks. USA member Joseph Byrd claims to have little input to the Sundazed re-release of the album. Byrd claims he was [...] "interested in doing notes, and I figured this was a chance to get my voice heard - Dorothy and Rubinson had both done extensive interviews referring to me in unpleasant fashion (as justification for their coup, I imagine). I asked for $300 and got it. I've written elsewhere to you that Sundazed took out all references they found controversial, including one about Bill Graham." ...|$|R

Why are veterans at VA hospitals paying less for prescription drugs than people who are under Medicare Part D? Thats an area <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> after. Medicare fraud is getting out of control....I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have Medicare cover home health care.
