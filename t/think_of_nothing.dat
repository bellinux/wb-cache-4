500|$|The film's {{portrayal}} of ancient Persians caused a particularly strong reaction in Iran. Various Iranian officials condemned the film. The Iranian Academy of the Arts submitted a formal complaint against {{the film to}} UNESCO, labelling it {{an attack on the}} historical identity of Iran. The Iranian mission to the U.N. protested the film in a press release, and Iranian embassies protested its screening in France, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The film was banned within Iran as [...] "hurtful American propaganda". Reviewers in the United States and elsewhere [...] "noted the political overtones of the West-against-Iran story line and the way Persians are depicted as decadent, sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks". With bootleg versions of the film already available in Tehran with the film's international release and news of the film's surprising success at the U.S. box office, it prompted widespread anger in Iran. Azadeh Moaveni of Time reported, [...] "All of Tehran was outraged. Everywhere I went yesterday, the talk vibrated with indignation over the film". Newspapers in Iran featured headlines such as [...] "Hollywood declares war on Iranians" [...] and [...] "300 Against 70 Million" [...] (Iran's population). Ayende-No, an independent Iranian newspaper, said that [...] "he film depicts Iranians as demons, without culture, feeling or humanity, who <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> except attacking other nations and killing people". Four Iranian Members of Parliament have called for Muslim countries to ban the film, and a group of Iranian film makers submitted a letter of protest to UNESCO regarding the film's alleged misrepresentation of Iranian history and culture. Iran's cultural advisor to president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called the film an [...] "American attempt for psychological warfare against Iran".|$|E

Fischer, who {{had visited}} Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, {{believed}} Goddard was doing valuable work {{and was able}} to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a PBY seaplane. By May 1942 he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the Pearl Harbor attack.

2500|$|By July 1918, {{there was}} open {{criticism}} of the National Shipyards proposals in the House of Commons. [...] The Liberal M.P.

[...] Greenwood went on:"What really is a serious {{matter is that the}} time and energy of the War Cabinet, which should <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but this awful War, where men are slaughtered daily, have been wasted by innumerable deputations, by arguments for and against, and by the pursuit of this phantom of a great national shipyard on the mud flats of a river in the West of England.

Zuo Ci openly mocked Cao Cao in court and Cao had him arrested; the guards beat Zuo cruelly, but the Taoist then fell asleep and slept soundly through the night. This enraged Cao Cao, who ordered Zuo Ci to be starved of food, this also failed as Zuo quite happily went seven days without food or water. After this Cao Cao could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else to punish Zuo Ci. When Zuo Ci appeared at Cao Cao's banquet, Cao tested him by asking to get, among other things, a dragon's liver, a peony, and perch from the Song River. Zuo Ci accomplished everything, which drew further suspicion from Cao Cao. Zuo Ci then offered a cup of wine to Cao Cao, who said that Zuo should taste first. Zuo Ci took a stick and divided the wine in half, and drank one half. Cao Cao was enraged.|$|E
