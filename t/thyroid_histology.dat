40|$|OBJECTIVE: Non-thyroidal illness (NTI) is {{associated}} with alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism. Whether morphological changes of the thyroid gland accompany NTI is unknown. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe thyroid morphology in patients with lethal non-thyroidal disease. DESIGN: In an autopsy study 267 cases have been examined. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Subjects were patients with chronic disease (group A), intensive care patients (group B) or persons who had died suddenly without pre-existing illnesses (group C). Patients (n = 93) who did not fit into one of these categories and subjects with pre-existing thyroid disorders were excluded. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> was assessed semi-quantitatively: grade I 75 % occupation of the thyroid gland by follicles with a diameter < 200 microm. RESULTS: Mean thyroid weight was 19. 9 g in group A (n= 75, age 19 [...] 96 (median 75) years, 48 males); 25. 7 g in group B (n= 64, age 24 [...] 93 (median 69) years, 43 males); and 26. 0 g in group C (n= 35, age 31 [...] 89 (median 69) years, 22 males) (P< 0. 0005, A vs B/C). Grade I <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> was present in 6 out of 75 patients with chronic illness, in 3 out of 64 intensive care patients and in 33 out of 35 sudden-death subjects.

40|$|Direct {{development}} is a widespread, alternative life history in Recent amphibians. There is no free-living, aquatic larva; adult features form in the embryo and are present at hatching. The mechanistic bases of direct development remain relatively unexplored. The current study describes the embryonic ontogeny of the thyroid gland in the direct-developing frog Eleutherodactylus coqui (Leptodactylidae) and quantifies histological changes {{that occur in the}} gland after its initial appearance. The thyroid gland of E. coqui is first apparent at Townsend-Stewart stage 10, approximately two-thirds of the way through embryogenesis. Soon after this the thyroid begins to accumulate follicular colloid. Quantitative analyses of <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> reveal embryonic peaks in two measures, follicle number and follicle volume, which are followed by declines in these measures prior to hatching. These peaks in thyroid activity in E. coqui are correlated with morphological changes that are directly comparable to metamorphic changes in frogs that retain the ancestral, biphasic life history. In metamorphic taxa, a histologically identifiable thyroid gland does not form until the larval period, well after hatching. Nevertheless, measures of <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> observed in E. coqui follow the pattern reported for metamorphosing amphibians. The present results support the hypothesis that the evolution of direct development in anurans i...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was initiated {{to determine the}} mechanism(s) of action that could explain increased weight gain and decreased milk production i n dairy cattle fed corn silage containing residues of certain organophosphate pesticides. It was proposed that the mode of action involved and alteration of thyroid physiology by the metabolites of the pesticides, namely halogenated phenols. Studies were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of tri-halogenated phenols and pyridinols upon T 4 -binding to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and to liver mitochondria isolated from male rats. Using the rat as a model, feeding trials were performed to determine the effect of halogenated phenols and pyridinols on rate of gain, relative thyroid weight, <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology,</b> and serum- T 4 levels. In vitro results with BSA indicated that the mechanism could have involved competition between T 4 and the phenol for the T 4 -binding site(s) of serum proteins, thus possibly lowering the serum-T 4 level. This was not well substantiated by in vivo measurements of serum-T 4 levels from rats fed varying concentrations of halogenated phenols. The methods employed to determine the effect of halophenols upon r 4 binding to mitochondria indicated that these compounds are poor competitors for the T 4 -binding site on mitochondria.

40|$|Summary: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of methimazole {{treatment}} on the body weight and thyroid gland structure in rats. Methimazole given as 0. 02 % solution in drinking water for three weeks induced significant decline in T 4 and T 3 levels, as determined by radioimmunoassay. The body weight gain was lowered compared to control animals, while thyroid weight was increased. Histological examination of the thyroid gland revealed a pronounced growth activation of the follicular epithelial component with frequent mitoses, accompanied with improved vascularisation. We assumed that the lower body weight gain despite decreased basal metabolic rate and similar food ingestion can be a result of brown adipose tissue activity.

40|$|Objective: To {{monitor the}} {{long-term}} {{health status of}} a cohort of client-owned Basenji dogs over several years; to compare the accuracy of various laboratory methods to assess thyroid status; and to document any adverse effects of routinely recommended doses of thyroxine for confirmed or presumptive hypothyroidism. Methods: Health outcomes were followed by 1 - 8 years of clinical surveillance using serum total thyroid hormone (TT 4) and canine thyroid-stimulating hormone (cTSH) concentrations, and either dynamic thyroid testing using recombinant human (rh) TSH, and/or thyroid histopathology at necropsy. The long-term accuracy of the various diagnostic interpretative criteria for rhTSH stimulation was analysed. The clinical history and serial concentrations of TT 4 and cTSH in dogs suspected of exhibiting adverse clinical responses to standard thyroxine supplementation were reviewed. Results: When rhTSH interpretative criteria were compared with <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> at necropsy, Larsson's equation correctly identified normal Basenji dogs from dogs with hypothyroidism and extensive thyroid pathology, yet provided an equivocal result for dogs that were not hypothyroid. Despite sequential low TT 4 concentration measurements over several years of clinical surveillance, these 'equivocal' dogs had unremarkable <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> (consistent with breed and age) at necropsy. Thyroxine supplementation at recommended dose rates resulted in clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis in six elderly Basenji dogs. Conclusion: Age and breed may account for dose-related adverse responses in Basenji dogs dosed with thyroxine at recommended doses. We recommend that when conducting therapeutic thyroid supplementation trials in this breed, the drug be administered in gradually increasing doses to avoid dose-related side effects. In a breed with a lower than 'normal' reference interval for serum TT 4 concentration, attempts to achieve the post-pill TT 4 concentration achieved in normal dogs may induce signs of thyrotoxicosis. Serial cTSH concentration measurements are helpful when adjusting thyroxine supplementation in Basenji dogs. Larsson's equation can be of assistance in interpreting dynamic thyroid testing using rhTSH in this breed. The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism in the Basenji breed appears to be low. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Fertile White Leghorn chicken {{eggs were}} {{injected}} on the 10 th day of in-cubation with 0, 1. 50, or 2. 00 p. p. m. Thimet {{and allowed to}} hatch. The following para-meters were examined: hatchability, incidence of deformities, thyroid weight, <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology,</b> thyroid M 5 I uptake, and brain cholinesterase activity. As the Thimet dosage was increased, the hatchability decreased, and the incidence of deformities increased. There was {{a significant increase in}} thyroid weight in the 2. 00 p. p. m. Thimet injected group. The rate of ^T uptake by the thyroid in the treated groups was also significantly different. The histological picture revealed an increase in follicular resorption vacuoles in the treated groups. These results suggest that the Thimet injected chick embryos have hyperthyroid tendencies in the immediate post-hatched life.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Vps 10 p {{family member}} sortilin is {{expressed}} in thyroid epithelial cells where it contributes to recycling of the thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin (Tg), {{a process that is}} thought to render hormone release more effective. Here we investigated the functional impact of sortilin in the thyroid gland using sortilin-deficient mice. METHODS: We measured free T 4, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and Tg serum levels and studied thyroid morphology in 14 sortilin-deficient (Sort 1) (-/-) and 12 wildtype (WT) mice. RESULTS: Serum free T 4 levels did not differ between Sort 1 (-/-) and WT females but were significantly lower in Sort 1 (-/-) males compared with WT (P =. 0424). Neither serum TSH nor Tg levels differed between Sort 1 (-/-) and WT mice, regardless of sex. On the same line, no <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> differences were observed.

40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, {{organisms are}} sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone signaling which can reset the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. It has been hypothesized that this developmental programming is a ‘predictive adaptive response’, a physiological adjustment {{in accordance with the}} embryonic environment that will best aid an individual’s survival in a similar postnatal environment. When the embryonic environment is a poor predictor of the external environment, the developmental changes are no longer adaptive and can result in disease states. We predicted that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmentally-based iodide imbalance could lead to developmental changes to the thyroid axis. To explore whether iodide or EDCs could alter developmental programming, we collected American alligator eggs from an estuarine environment with high iodide availability and elevated thyroid-specific EDCs, a freshwater environment contaminated with elevated agriculturally derived EDCs, and a reference freshwater environment. We then incubated them under identical conditions.

50|$|Patients will {{experience}} a hyperthyroid period as the cellular lining of colloid spaces fails, allowing abundant colloid into the circulation, with neck pain and fever.

The results showed that exposure to Aroclor 1254 for 50 d increased follicular cell height, colloid depletion, and hyperplasia. In particular, hypothyroidism, which was induced by the administration of 1000 ng/L Aroclor 1254, significantly decreased plasma TT 4, TT 3, and FT 3 levels. Profiles of the changes in mRNA expression levels of IDs were observed in the liver and kidney after 25 and 50 d PCB exposure, which might be associated with a reduction in plasma THs levels.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of thyroid lesions detected by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) incidentally, determine malignancy risk and its relationship with maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and FDG uptake pattern. Methods: Between February 2009 and February 2014, a total of 12713 patients underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Incidental thyroid uptake was seen in 710 patients and further diagnostic evaluation was performed on 147 patients with focal or diffuse FDG uptake. The 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings of these patients and their association with malignancy were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas detected by 18 F-FDG PET/CT was 5. 6 % (710 / 12713). Of the 147 patients who underwent biopsy or <b>thyroid</b> surgery, <b>histology</b> was benign in 99 and malign in 48 patients. The malignancy risk of incidental thyroid lesions was calculated as 32. 7 % (48 / 147). The median SUVmax was 2. 9 (0. 6 – 27. 4) in benign group, whereas 11. 8 (2. 4 – 72. 9) in malign group and the difference between these groups was statistically significant (p <  0. 001). According to the ROC analysis, a SUVmax above 6 was more likely to be malign with statistical significance (p <  0. 001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 87. 4 %, 81. 7 %, 70. 1 % and 93 % respectively. Conclusion: The malignancy risk of incidental thyroid lesions on 18 F-FDG PET/CT is high. Although it is obvious that higher SUVmax values are tended to be malign, an overlap between benign and malign groups is still remaining. In case of absence of clinical contraindications, further examination should be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Differentiated thyroid {{carcinoma}} {{makes up}} to 90 % of all thyroid cancers. Literature review indicates that surgery {{is the primary}} mode of treatment {{for this type of}} thyroid carcinoma and is associated with lower recurrence rate. Objective. To investigate effect of surgery plus adjuvant therapy vs. surgery alone on the evidence or no evidence of thyroid cancer at the follow up. To investigate if the effect was confounded or modified by histological type, stage, or gender. Methods. Secondary database analysis of 4, 699 patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma in Florida between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2002 was performed. The Chi-square- General Association tested the independence of the treatment vs. outcome {{in the presence of the}} third stratification factor. Mantel-Haenszel stratified methodology was used to analyze all three third factors. Results. Patients with localized papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are 20 % more likely to have evidence of carcinoma if they undergo surgery plus adjuvant therapy than patients with follicular variant of papillary <b>thyroid</b> carcinoma (FVPTC). <b>Histology,</b> gender and stage were found to be EM, risk factor and confounder, respectively. Conclusion. The data analysis suggests that patients with PTC, who were treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy, may more likely to have evidence of cancer at the follow up than patients with FVPTC. Authors suggest that histology, gender and stage should be considered and controlled for during planning stage of the study and/or during analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{described}} the relative survival of thyroid cancer cases diagnosed in Europe {{during the period}} 1990 - 1994 and analysed time trends in relative survival during the period 1983 - 1994 using the EUROCARE- 3 database. Relative survival of thyroid cancers {{is one of the}} highest amongst cancer sites, with age-standardised relative survival rates of 74 % in men and 82 % in women over the period 1990 - 1994, with marked differences between countries. The higher relative survival rates are observed in Scandinavian countries and the lower rates are observed in the UK and the countries of Eastern Europe. Relative survival is higher in women than in men, and decreases with age whatever the histological group. There are significant differences in relative survival according to histological type. Relative survival has slightly increased over the period 1983 - 1994 only when all histological types have been considered together. Time trend was, however, non-existent when the different histological groups were taken into account except during the most recent period of observation. One possible explanation for the differences in relative survival between countries and sex may probably be found in the changes in thyroid classification and diagnosis techniques. When these changes are not homogeneous, the distribution of <b>thyroid</b> cancers by <b>histology</b> and by stage at diagnosis may be very different. The only way to understand these differences is to conduct specific studies including a description of stage at diagnosis, diagnosis procedures used for staging and details of treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the alterations of organochlorinated compounds such as polychlorobiphenyls (PCB), dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) on the thyroid in wild and cultured sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at environmental concentrations. These compounds influence the endocrine system of many fish species and are qualified as endocrine disruptors. The thyroid {{seems to be}} a target organ. Two alteration endpoints: the <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> and the muscular thyroid hormone concentrations, were used simultaneously. High concentrations in PCBs and DDT were detected in muscles, supporting the idea that the Mediterranean fauna could be more polluted than the Atlantic fauna. The high abundance of DDE indicates a progressive degradation of remnant DDT load and the absence of new inputs in this area. Aquaculture sea bass shows a significant higher amount of pollutants on fresh weight basis (especially PCBs) in their muscles compared to the wild sea bass. Those differences may be related mainly to the contaminations of diet. Thyroid parameters vary between wild and aquaculture sea bass, wild sea bass were characterized by higher follicle diameters, epithelial cell heights and muscular T 4 concentrations. A significant relationship between persistent organic pollutants (muscular PCBs and DDT concentration) and the different thyroid parameters (diameters of follicles, epithelial cell heights and muscular T 4 levels) could be observed, which support the hypothesis that these compounds have an adverse impact on thyroid morphometry and function.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of thiocyanate (SCN-) in {{the blood}} plasma of 35 -g rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were followed during a 20 -day exposure to 39. 8 mg SCN- liter- 1 and the subsequent 16 -day depuration period. SCN- concentrations were determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Kinetic constants were estimated using a one-compartment first-order kinetic model fitted to the data by the computer programs BIOFAC and SYSTAT. The respective BIOFAC and SYSTAT estimates for the uptake rate constant (k 1, 0. 55 and 0. 49 day- 1), the depuration rate constant (k 2, 0. 34 and 0. 29 day- 1), and the bioconcentration factor (BCF, 1. 61 and 1. 66) were similar for both methods of calculation. Field studies were conducted to determine the impact of SCN- on white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) populations in waters receiving SCN(-) -bearing effluents. The assessment was based on SCN- concentrations in water and fish plasma, and the <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> of the fish. Although SCN- was detected in the water at one site, no SCN- was detected in fish plasma {{and none of the}} thyroid pathology characteristic of chronic SCN- exposure was present. The results suggest that SCN- was not a hazard to the white sucker populations studied.

40|$|Advanced human thyroid cancers, {{particularly}} those that are refractory to treatment with radioiodine (RAI), have a high prevalence of BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B 1) mutations. However, {{the degree to which}} these cancers are dependent on BRAF expression is still unclear. To address this question, we generated mice expressing one of the most commonly detected BRAF mutations in human papillary thyroid carcinomas (BRAFV 600 E) in thyroid follicular cells in a doxycycline-inducible (dox-inducible) manner. Upon dox induction of BRAFV 600 E, the mice developed highly penetrant and poorly differentiated thyroid tumors. Discontinuation of dox extinguished BRAFV 600 E expression and reestablished thyroid follicular architecture and normal <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology.</b> Switching on BRAFV 600 E rapidly induced hypothyroidism and virtually abolished thyroid-specific gene expression and RAI incorporation, all of which were restored to near basal levels upon discontinuation of dox. Treatment of mice with these cancers with small molecule inhibitors of either MEK or mutant BRAF reduced their proliferative index and partially restored thyroid-specific gene expression. Strikingly, treatment with the MAPK pathway inhibitors rendered the tumor cells susceptible to a therapeutic dose of RAI. Our data show that thyroid tumors carrying BRAFV 600 E mutations are exquisitely dependent on the oncoprotein for viability and that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of its expression or activity is associated with tumor regression and restoration of RAI uptake in vivo in mice. These findings have potentially significant clinical ramifications...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutation}} BRAF V 600 E {{is thought}} to be a putative prognostic marker of the aggressiveness of several cancers among which is also papillary thyroid cancer. Our study aimed to evaluate whether this mutation is associated with advanced stages of disease or with a worse prognosis in a series of patients with cytological findings of Thyr 4 and Thyr 5 and who were undergoing total thyroidectomy and routine central compartment lymph-node dissection. 110 patients were consecutively enrolled over an 18 -month period from September 2010 to March 2012. All patients had cytological findings that were either indicative of, or positive for papillary thyroid cancer, Thyr 4 or Thyr 5. Detection of BRAF mutation was made on fine-needle aspiration specimen by pyrosequencing after microdissection and DNA extraction of neoplastic cells. After surgical intervention, the patients underwent radioiodine ablation according to our protocol, and follow-up was performed after 8 months. The BRAF V 600 E mutation was found in 79 % of our cases: 85. 7 % of these cases represented the classical variant, 57. 8 % the follicular variant, 89. 6 % the tall cell variant, and 33. 3 % the solid variant. All patients had confirmation of papillary <b>thyroid</b> cancer after <b>histology,</b> with no differences being seen in pTNM presentation between patients with BRAF wild-type and patients with BRAF V 600 E mutation. Ninety-nine patients underwent radioiodine ablation. Results at follow-up 8 months after radioiodine ablation showed no differences in the rate of ablation between patients harboring BRAF V 600 E mutation and those having BRAF wild-type. The BRAF V 600 E mutation doesn't appear to be a reliable risk factor for the aggressiveness of a tumor. BRAF analysis should neither be the only guide for pre-surgical decisions regarding the extent of surgery nor for post-surgical decisions regarding the aggressiveness of the treatment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media...|$|R
40|$|Background Although both <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> and serum {{concentrations}} of hormones {{are known to}} change with age, only a few reports exist {{on the relationship between}} the age-related structural and functional changes of the thyroid follicles in both mice and humans. Our objectives were to investigate age-related histological changes of the thyroid follicles and to determine whether these morphological changes were associated with the functional activity of the follicles. Methods The thyroid glands of mice at 18 weeks and at 6, 15, and 30 months of age were histologically examined, and the serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 11 -week-old and 20 -month-old mice. Samples of human thyroid tissue from 10 women over 70 years old and 10 women between 30 and 50 years of age were analyzed in conjunction with serum thyroid hormone level. Results The histological and functional changes observed in the thyroid follicles of aged mice and women were as follows: variable sizing and enlargement of the follicles; increased irregularity of follicles; Sanderson’s polsters in the wall of large follicles; a large thyroglobulin (Tg) globule or numerous small fragmented Tg globules in follicular lumens; oncocytic change in follicular cells; and markedly dilated follicles empty of colloid. Serum T 3 levels in 20 -month-old mice and humans were unremarkable. Conclusions Thyroid follicles of aged mice and women show characteristic morphological changes, such as cystic atrophy, empty colloid, and Tg globules...|$|E
40|$|Radioiodine uptake in liver metastases was {{observed}} in two patients with follicular card noma of the thyroid. There are few reports {{in the literature of}} func tioning metastases in the liver from differentiated thyroid carcinoma detected by scintigraphy, although in postmortem examination involvement of the liver is reported to be approximately 25 % (1 â€” 3). It has been suggested that metastatic invasion of the liver is usuallyterminal (4). In a seriesof 349 patients with thyroid carcinoma seen in the last 10 years, we found two patients with definite metastases in the liver demonstrable as focal areas of positive con centration in the liver scan after administration of radioiodine. CASE REPORTS Case 1. A 62 -year-old woman was referred on July 10, 1967 for radioiodine ablation after total thyroidectomy. The <b>thyroid</b> <b>histology</b> was follicular carcinoma. The clinical examination revealed a tender bony swelling 7 X 4 cm over the right mandible and a hard nodular liver that extended 5 cm below the costal margin. An x-ray skeletal survey did not suggest any other bony involvement except for the mandibular erosion with pathologic fracture. Liver function tests were normal. Whole-body scan after a large tracer dose of 1. 1 mCi of 1311 showedtwo areas of abnormal radioiodine accumulation: one corresponding to the mandibular metastasis and the other in the epigastric region to the right of midline (Fig. 1). The radio iodine concentration in the liver could not be dis charged with potassium perchlorate. Liver scan done with 1311 -rosebengal demonstrated the same area to be â€œcoldâ€•(Fig. 2). The patient received 945 mCi of 1311 in divided dosesspreadover the next 3 years. The mandibula...|$|E
