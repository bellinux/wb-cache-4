5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> Players Association since 1990, Linden {{was responsible for}} being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{a dispute}} arose between Foran, {{in his role}} as Stanley Cup trustee, and <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> The American Hockey League had asked for a Stanley Cup {{challenge}} against the champions of <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> Foran had agreed to the challenge and ordered <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> to comply, but <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> refused to play the challenge. Foran was fired from his position as Senators' president and was replaced by Redmond Quain.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> faced {{competition}} from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks {{to play for the}} Winnipeg Jets. He signed a $2.75million contract, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit and <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972–73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> to the WHA. <b>The</b> <b>NHL</b> also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans. The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams. Following the 1972–73 season, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> announced it was further expanding to 18-teams for the 1974–75 season, adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals. In just eight years, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> had tripled in size to 18 teams.|$|E

Special exhibits in the past included an exhibit in 2000 showcasing Gretzky memorabilia.|$|E
5|$|The National Hockey League {{came into}} {{existence}} with the suspension of the NHA in 1917. After unsuccessfully resolving disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises—the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators—suspended the NHA, and formed <b>the</b> <b>NHL,</b> replacing Livingstone's team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas. While new, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> was {{a continuation of the}} NHA. <b>The</b> <b>NHL</b> adopted the NHA's constitution, its rules, playing with six men to a side rather than the then-traditional seven and the NHA's split-season schedule. The owners originally intended <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> to only operate for one season. However, the NHA was suspended permanently in 1918 and ceased to be an organisation in 1920. In 1921, the NHA championship trophy O'Brien Cup was adopted as the championship trophy of <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Original Six era {{ended in}} 1967 when <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> {{doubled in size}} by adding six new {{expansion}} teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division. <b>The</b> <b>NHL</b> continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially {{brought about by the}} NHL's attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. <b>The</b> <b>NHL</b> became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, and a tie. Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were bought by <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> This left <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> {{as the only}} league left {{competing}} for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> In 1947, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to <b>the</b> <b>NHL,</b> allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished {{to play for the}} Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement. <b>The</b> <b>NHL</b> has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating, {{as was the case in}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|When the NHA was {{suspended}} in 1917, the Cup {{was held by}} the Montreal Canadiens. It remained in their care until 1921. In November 1921, {{it was announced that}} the Cup would be given over to the National Hockey League to be awarded annually to <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> champions. NHL president Frank Calder arranged with Ambrose O'Brien a new deed of gift. The Cup, which Calder had secured following the death of Montreal President George Kennedy, was then presented to <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> champion Ottawa Senators. In 1925, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> inaugurated the Prince of Wales Trophy, which also was presented to <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> champions.|$|E
5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> since its founding, it was still rare to see them in <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> until 1980, {{although}} the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined <b>the</b> <b>NHL,</b> but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Europeans' entrance into <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in <b>the</b> <b>NHL,</b> teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft; however, defection was the only way such players could play in <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> Shortly {{before the end of the}} 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b> Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E

5|$|After the season, {{the owners}} asked <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> {{for a second}} time for {{permission}} to suspend operations. This time, <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> refused the request.

Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E

The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups and played in <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> from 1917 until 1934.
