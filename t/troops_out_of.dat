Sir William Howe, the {{commander-in-chief}} of British forces in North America, led a sizable contingent of <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia in one last attempt to destroy Washington and the Continental Army before {{the onset of}} winter. After a series of skirmishes, Howe called off the attack and returned to Philadelphia without engaging Washington in a decisive conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{eventually}} led his untrained and ill-equipped <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bridgwater at around 10:00pm {{to undertake a}} night-time attack on the King's army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane {{and came to the}} open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (drainage ditches).|$|E
5|$|UN forces {{began their}} final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on 15 August. Intense {{fighting}} around P'ohang-dong ensued {{for several days}} as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By 17 August, UN forces were able to push North Korean <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Kyongju corridor and An'gang-ni, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. The NK 766th Independent Regiment—now down to 1,500 men—was forced to withdraw north to prevent being surrounded.|$|E

5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Korea.|$|E
5|$|By August 14, large NK {{forces were}} focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However {{they were unable}} to hold it because of US air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. The North Korean supply chain had completely broken down and more food, ammunition, and supplies were not available. UN forces began their final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang-dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By August 17, UN forces were able to push North Korean <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Kyongju and An'gang-ni areas, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. By August 19 the North Korean forces had completely withdrawn from the offensive.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1861, both {{federal and}} Confederate troops entered Kentucky. Magoffin {{declared}} both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality {{and demanded that}} both sides withdraw. A resolution calling for immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant (lieutenant general) in October 1799, Vukassovich {{took part}} in the 1800 Italian campaign. When Bonaparte invaded Italy via the Great Saint Bernard Pass, he {{commanded}} a division farther east in the area of Lake Maggiore and Lake Como. On 25 May, a cavalry patrol of Vukassovich's scouts briefly captured Bonaparte before themselves becoming prisoners when the French general's escort appeared. The sudden French offensive drove Vukassovich's outnumbered <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Milan. Pursued by Guillaume Duhesme's French corps, he retreated to Brescia and Cremona with his remaining 4,000 men, missing the Battle of Marengo.|$|E
5|$|Several months previously, Texians {{had driven}} all Mexican <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mexican Texas. About 100Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew {{slightly}} {{with the arrival}} of reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as {{the first step in a}} campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies, but the Texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men.|$|E
5|$|Towards midday, the 79th Reserve Division {{was ordered}} to {{recapture}} the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack. However, {{it was not until}} 6:00pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack, clearing the Canadian Corps <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ruined village of Vimy but not recapturing the third line south of the village. By night time, the German forces holding the top of the ridge believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the mean time. Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by late evening portions of the 111th Infantry Division occupied the third line near Acheville and Arleux, with the remainder of the division arriving the following day.|$|E

5|$|At {{about this}} time, the 15th Brigade IV Corps {{was sent to}} link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area, with the brigade's horse {{artillery}} battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past {{the rear of the}} Armee Du Nord's right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.|$|E
5|$|At {{midnight on}} 20 July 1947, the Dutch {{launched}} a major military offensive called Operatie Product, {{with the intent}} of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as politionele acties ("police actions") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the Dutch gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, and oil and coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, as the {{annexation}} of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area {{in anticipation of}} a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas–Mexico border. The Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846. In May, Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and managed to drive his <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Texas. Taylor subsequently led his troops into Mexico, where they once again defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey in September. Defying orders, Taylor moved his troops further south. Despite being severely outnumbered, he dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio López de Santa Anna in February 1847 at the Battle of Buena Vista. After this, most of Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor's popularity remained significant.|$|E

5|$|Kaim had six battalions of infantry, four squadrons of cavalry {{and plenty}} of {{artillery}} deployed at Rothenzholl. He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb {{to the north and}} an advance guard in Loffenau. Saint-Cyr left Duhesme's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain. He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve. Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank, he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad. Taponier surprised the Saxons and sent them scurrying back north. With Lambert and Lecourbe's brigades, Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim. Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses, Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim's <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He swung his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The French {{fell back}} c. 3km and {{attempted}} to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle {{was as good as}} won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief-of-staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. The Austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to the Austrian army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On the Austrian right wing, O'Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> supporting distance from the Austrian main body. On the Austrian left, Ott hesitated to press hard against the French because GdB Jean Rivaud's small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.|$|E

5|$|Peng enlisted as {{a private}} second class, with a monthly wage of 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was {{promoted}} to private first class, with a monthly wage of 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which he sent to his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hunan in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his <b>troops</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
