5|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature was the cranial crest, which protruded {{from the rear}} of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea seems unlikely, Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> to the neck. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> before reversing direction and heading back down <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri, and more complex in P. tubicen, where some tubes were blind and others met and separated. While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature, P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> {{capuchin}} was discovered, it {{was formally}} classified as Cebus apella robustus and considered a subspecies of the tufted capuchin. In 2001, Groves proposed that <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin was a subspecies {{of the black}} capuchin and should be moved to Cebus nigritus robustus. In 2012, it was proposed that the Cebus genus should be split and that all robust capuchins should be under the genus Sapajus. Additionally, it was also argued that <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin is a separate species from the black capuchin, and therefore the new classification for <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin should be Sapajus robustus It has also been estimated using mitochondrial DNA that <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin diverged from the black capuchin over 5 million years ago, providing further evidence that <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin is a separate species from the black capuchin. However, Cebus nigritus robustus may still be {{used to refer to}} <b>the</b> <b>crested</b> capuchin.|$|R
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was used for intra-species recognition. This means that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> {{could have been used}} for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> probably to strengthen it. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E

5|$|Crest badges are {{specifically}} used {{for people to}} wear, and are made out of silver or white metal.

5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> may {{have served as}} a rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 August, {{supported}} by the 7th Battalion of the Gloucesters and by extensive artillery and naval fire, the Wellington Battalion succeeded in capturing Chunuk Bair with relatively little resistance. Malone set about securing <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of Chunuk Bair, but it proved difficult to deepen the relatively shallow Turkish trenches that had been captured by his men, and the work was made even more difficult as the sun rose, allowing the Turks on neighbouring Hill Q to focus their gunfire on the positions occupied by the Wellingtons. The Gloucesters, also on <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> were forced to retreat to the reverse slope. The Turkish gunfire caused heavy casualties amongst the infantry holding Chunuk Bair, but crucially also prevented substantive reinforcements from reaching <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> in daylight. Instead, those soldiers that made it up Chunuk Bair tended to be positioned on its rearward slopes and thus had difficulty observing any approaches made by the Turks. Malone continued to co-ordinate the defences but a portion of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was lost. He remained in constant action, and led bayonet charges to counter numerous Turkish attacks. The trenches on <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> became filled with the bodies of dead, further reducing what little cover was available.|$|E

5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were at the front of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> which {{is the only way to}} tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of <b>the</b> <b>crest.</b> Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> so the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> {{had little to do with}} the sense of smell.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under <b>the</b> <b>crest.</b> In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> being coloured blue.|$|E
