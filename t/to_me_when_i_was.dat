He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 30, Akram was {{diagnosed}} with diabetes. [...] "I remember what a shock it was because I was a healthy sportsman with no history of diabetes in my family, so I didn't expect it at all.

[...] Since then he has actively sought to be involved in various awareness campaigns for diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every year of my life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people {{to take care of}} me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E
