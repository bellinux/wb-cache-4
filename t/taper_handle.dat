50|$|The {{curve of}} the {{original}} Opinel blade is a Yatagan, while the flared butt {{at the base of}} the wood handle is referred to as a fishtail. The No. 8 Couteau du Jardin or Garden Knife uses a folding drop-point blade in concert with a slim, <b>tapered</b> wood <b>handle,</b> while the Opinel No. 8 and No. 10 Pruning Knives, designed for pruning shrubs and vines, feature a large folding hawkbill blade fitted to an elegantly curved wooden handle. The Opinel Slim Effile series use a thinner-profile stainless steel blade fitted to a <b>tapered</b> wood <b>handle.</b> Available in several sizes and handle materials, the Slim Effile series knives are intended for tasks such as cleaning and fileting fish and thinly slicing meats and cheeses.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Disability and Rehabilitation [© Informa Healthcare]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] The aim of the pilot study was to provide information about the design and use of saucepan handles to enable clinicians and designers to specify and provide products that are more appropriate for use by people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objectives were: to evaluate aspects of new handle design for saucepans in terms of their ease of use for people with RA; document hand grip strength and configuration (grip patterns); record relevant anthropometric data to aid the development of new designs and perform an assessment of lifting techniques used in conjunction with perceived optimum handle configuration. Method/Results: Observation and video footage show that subjects continued to use familiar, but damaging, ways of lifting the saucepan even after extensive joint protection training by occupational therapists. Grip strengths recorded using a sphygmomanometer were similar to those found by other studies. The anthropometric measurements taken from the sample group were found to be within available anthropometric surveys of able-bodied people. However, hand length within the sample group with RA was longer than the equivalent in surveys of able-bodied subjects. Conclusions: Subjects preferred the narrower handles with some surface texture to the larger and more rounded <b>tapered</b> <b>handles.</b> Large handled saucepans were found not to be viable due to the constraints of UK cooking hob sizes and existing British Standards relating to saucepan specification...|$|R
2500|$|The silver {{tableware}} in the hoard comprises three strainers and 33 spoons, of two types. [...] Seventeen of the spoons are cochlearia, {{with long}} <b>tapered</b> <b>handles,</b> {{and the other}} sixteen are the larger ligulae or cigni, with bowls {{about the size of}} a modern dessert spoon and short, coiled handles ending in birds' heads. [...] Many of the spoons bear pagan inscriptions to Faunus, a minor Roman god who had many characteristics in common with the Greek Pan. [...] There is no overtly Christian symbolism in the hoard, though one spoon is decorated with the figure of a fish, which can often be an oblique reference to Christianity. [...] Bacchic iconography is obvious in the group, and was traditional in Roman culture, but in the late Roman period, many Bacchic motifs were adopted and given new interpretations by Christians. Nevertheless, at this date, the end of the 4th century AD, there was no obstacle to placing unequivocally Christian symbols and inscriptions on personal possessions, so that their absence here is noteworthy. The openly, and probably exclusively, pagan iconography remains one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the assemblage.|$|R
50|$|Bows usually <b>taper</b> {{from the}} <b>handle</b> to the tips. Tapering reduces {{mass in the}} outer limb and dissipates the limb stresses; this {{increases}} {{the speed at which}} the tips move which propels arrows faster. Shapes may be optimized for various purposes, especially maximum speed of the arrow; the details are the subject of active research.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} semiparametric fractional exponential (FEXP) estimators of {{the memory}} parameter for a potentially nonstationary linear long-memory time series with smooth additive trend. We use differencing to annihilate the trend, followed by <b>tapering</b> to <b>handle</b> the potential non-invertibility of the differenced series. We propose a method of pooling the tapered periodogram which leads to more efficient estimators of than existing pooled, tapered estimators. We establish asymptotic normality of the estimator. Finally, we consider minimax rate-optimality and feasible nearly rate-optimal estimators. Some simulations are presented to illustrate our findings. Applications to measure the Hurst coefficient of network traffic data will be presented {{at the time of}} the conference. 1...|$|R
500|$|The large {{collection}} of spoons includes 51 cochlearia, which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long, <b>tapering</b> <b>handles</b> with a pointed end {{which was used}} to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table. There are 23 cigni, which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the alpha and omega in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As {{is often the case}} with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus", which occurs on a set of five cochlearia and five ladles. It is unknown whether any of the people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive {{at the time it was}} buried.|$|R

We use differencing to annihilate the polynomial trend, followed by <b>tapering</b> to <b>handle</b> the potential non-invertibility of the differenced series. We propose a method of pooling the tapered periodogram which leads to more efficient estimators of d than existing pooled, tapered estimators. We establish asymptotic normality of the tapered FEXP estimator in the Gaussian case with or without pooling. We establish asymptotic normality of the estimator in the linear case if pooling is used. Finally, we consider minimax rate-optimality and feasible nearly rate-optimal estimators in the Gaussian case.

50|$|All machine tapers are {{sensitive}} to chips, nicks (dents), and dirt. They will not locate accurately, and the self-holding variety will not hold reliably, if such problems interfere with the seating of the male into the female with firm contact over the whole conical surface. Machinists are trained on keeping <b>tapers</b> clean and <b>handling</b> them in ways that prevent them from being nicked by other tools. CNC tool-changing cycles usually include a compressed-air blast while one toolholder is being swapped with the next. The air blast tends to blow away chips that might otherwise end up interfering between the toolholder and spindle.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new framework for recovering superquadrics with global deformations from multi-view real range data. The framework aims at improving confidence {{and accuracy of}} recovered models by utilizing multiview information, and consists of the initial superquadric model recovery, view registration, view integration, and final model recovery from integrated data. A quadrant analysis technique is proposed to aid the recovery of bending superquadrics. A modified range data registration method based on recovered superquadrics is also proposed to <b>handle</b> <b>tapered</b> superquadrics. Experimental results indicate the proposed framework of multi-view representation significantly improved the accuracy and confidence of recovered superquadrics compared with existing recovery strategies which rely on single-view range images. 1...|$|R

60|$|Lastly, for {{altogether}} exceptional crimes, or {{for open}} outbreaks of insubordination, {{there was the}} plete--flogging with a whip of twisted hide, fastened to a handle ten inches long and an inch thick. The lash is at first the same thickness as the <b>handle,</b> <b>tapering</b> for twelve inches, and then divided into three smaller lashes, each twenty-five inches long and about {{the thickness of the}} little finger. This terrible weapon is in use only at three of the Siberian prisons, of which Kara is one. From twenty to twenty-five lashes are given, and the punishment is considered equivalent to a sentence to death, as in many cases the culprit survives the punishment but a short time. The prisoners were agreed that at Kara the punishment of the plete was extremely rare, only being given for the murder of a convict or official by one of the convicts. The quarrels among the prisoners, although frequent, and attended by great shouting and gesticulation, very rarely came to blows, the Russians having no idea of using their fists, and the contests, when it came to that, being little more than a tussle, with hair pulling and random blows. Had the prisoners had knives or other weapons ready to hand, the results would have been very different.|$|R
