40|$|The {{electricity}} {{pricing structure}} in Texas has changed after deregulation (January 2002). The Energy Systems Laboratory {{has served as}} a technical consultant on electricity purchases to several universities in the Texas A&M University System since 2001. In the fiscal year of 2006 Stephen F. Austin State University joined with the TAMU campuses and agencies, and there are now 183 accounts in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) North, Northeast, South, West, and Houston areas of Texas. From the 183 accounts, 9 Interval Data Recorder (IDR) accounts consume 92 % of the total load. The objective of this research is to find the most economic price structure to purchase electricity for the Texas A&M System and Stephen F. Austin University by analyzing various pricing scenarios: the spot market, forward contracts, take or pay contracts and on/off season (tiered) contracts. The analysis was based on the 9 IDR accounts. The prices for the spot market were given by ERCOT and the other prices by Sempra. The energy charges were calculated every 15 minute using the real historical consumption of each facility and the aggregated load of all facilities. The result for the analysis was given for each institution separately, {{as well as for the}} aggregated load of all facilities. The results of the analysis showed that the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> was the most economical structure to purchase electricity for each individual university and for the total aggregated load of all 9 IDR accounts. From March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006, purchasing electricity on the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> would have cost $ 13, 810, 560. The forward contract, that is, purchasing electricity on a fixed rate, was the next cheapest with an energy cost of $ 14, 266, 870 from March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2006, 3 % higher than purchasing electricity at the <b>tiered</b> <b>price.</b> The most expensive method to purchase electricity would have been the spot market. Its energy costs would have been approximately $ 18, 171, 610, 36 % and 31 % higher, respectively, than purchasing electricity at the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> and the fixed rate...|$|E

40|$|We use vector error {{correction}} models {{to examine the}} interdependence between the high and the low price tiers during the latest housing market boom and bust. For 118 of the 364 US statistical areas analyzed, the <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> indexes are bound by a long-run relationship. In general, low tier homes appreciated more than high tier homes {{in the past two}} decades. In contrast to previous periods of high volatility, however, low tier homes appreciated more during the boom and lost more value during the bust of the market. We find a shift in the long-run equilibrium during the bubble —the cointegration parameter that ties the tiers together is greater in absolute value during the bubble period compared to the periods of more moderate appreciation and depreciation rates. Moreover, the shift in the long-run equilibrium can be explained by differences in subprime originations across housing markets. We also find that short run price dynamics is driven by momentum in both segments of the market...|$|E

This paper explores the extent to which an international <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> framework and the present leeway for compulsory licensing can be reconciled, using the perspective of the right to health as defined in international human rights law. Discussion: We explore the practical feasibility of an international <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> and compulsory licensing framework governed by the World Health Organization. We use two simple benchmarks to compare the relative affordability of medicines for governments ? average income and burden of disease ? to illustrate how voluntary <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> practice fails to make medicines affordable enough for low and middle income countries (if compared with the financial burden of the same medicines for high income countries), and when and where international compulsory licenses should be issued in order to allow governments to comply with their obligations to realize the right to health.

40|$|The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) was {{established}} in 2010 to ensure timely access to low-cost generic versions of patented antiretroviral (ARV) medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through the negotiation of voluntary licences with patent holders. While robust data on the savings generated by MPP and other major global public health initiatives is important, it is also difficult to quantify. In this study, we estimate the savings generated by licences negotiated by the MPP for ARV medicines to treat HIV/AIDS in LMICs for the period 2010 - 2028 and generate a cost-benefit ratio-based on people living with HIV (PLHIVs) in any new countries which gain access to an ARV due to MPP licences and the price differential between originator's <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> and generics price, within the period where that ARV is patented. We found that the direct savings generated by the MPP {{are estimated to be}} USD 2. 3 billion (net present value) by 2028, representing an estimated cost-benefit ratio of 1 : 43, which means for every USD 1 spent on MPP, the global public health community saves USD 43. The saving of USD 2. 3 billion is equivalent to more than 24 million PLHIV receiving first-line ART in LMICs for 1 year at average prices today...|$|E
40|$|Thanks also to Sijia Yang for her tireless and {{enthusiastic}} research assistance. Holding limits and price containment in California’s emission markets 2 We use {{a set of}} economic experiments to test the effects of two key features of California’s new program for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The cap & trade scheme included in the program includes two novel features, limits on allowance ownership (or ‘holding limits’) and a <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> containment reserve sale. These program features are linked by their potential to affect liquidity {{in the market for}} emission allowances. We examine the effects of these features on liquidity and on measures of market performance including efficiency, price discovery, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits have the effect of substantially lowering the number of banked allowances available for trade, hence lowering liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time resulting in lower efficiency, less effective price discovery, and higher variability in price. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent.

40|$|Background Inadequate {{access to}} {{medicine}} {{is a key}} public health issue. It violates the basic human right, and impedes economics development and social progress. Differential pricing means to charge according to variant ability {{to pay for the}} same products. Since differential pricing has been successfully used into many business sectors, its adoption in pharmaceutical industry seems to be necessary and feasible to help improve access to medicine for developing countries. Objective This project is to review the effect of “differential pricing “in pharmaceutical industry and to discuss its current situation and future development. Methodology A literature review was conducted on this topic. Keywords of “(Tiered OR differential OR segment*) AND (price*) AND (developing countries) AND (pharmacy OR drug OR medicine OR vaccine) ” were used in databases of Pubmed, Medline and Google scholar for relevant studies and reports on differential pricing in pharmaceutical or vaccine markets. Result A total of 16 papers were included into this systematic review. In theory, differential pricing is a “win-win” solution with the ability to reconcile both static and dynamic costs. In practice, differential pricing works to help improve access, however, lower <b>tiered</b> <b>price</b> for patent drugs is still more expensive than generic drugs in most cases. Conclusion Differential pricing strategy has the potential to improve access to medicine. However it is still in an infancy stage, there are still lots of spaces for further improvement. Except for pricing policies, other mutual supportive policies also need to obtain a better access to medicine in developing countries. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we focus}} on the design of <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> plans offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). We also analyze the impact of data caps on the pricing plans, users, ISP profits and social welfare, by {{considering}} ISP monopoly and ISP duopoly, respectively. The initial work is about modeling ISP service tier design without data caps. Web browsing and video streaming are considered as the two dominant Internet applications. We propose a novel set of utility functions that depend on a user's willingness to pay for each application, the performance of each application, and the time devoted to each application. For a monopoly provider, the demand function for each tier is derived as a function of <b>tier</b> <b>price</b> and performance. We first give conditions for the <b>tier</b> rates, <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> and network capacity that maximize Internet Service Provider profit, defined as subscription revenue minus capacity cost. We then show how an Internet Service Provider may simplify tier and capacity design, by allowing their engineering department to set network capacity, their marketing department to set <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> and both to jointly set tier rates. The next work is focused on how ISPs choose data caps and the resulting impact on users. We propose a data cap model by extending the ISP tier design model. A monopoly ISP is presumed to maximize its profit by controlling <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>tier</b> rates, data caps and overage charges. We show how users fall into five categories: non-Internet subscribers, basic tier subscribers, premium tier subscribers unaffected by a data cap, premium tier subscribers who are capped but do not choose to exceed the cap, and premium tier subscribers who exceed the cap and pay overage charges. When data caps are used for profit maximization, we find that the monopoly ISP has the incentive to keep the basic <b>tier</b> <b>price</b> and basic <b>tier</b> rate unchanged, to increase the premium tier rate, and to reduce the premium <b>tier</b> <b>price.</b> The ISP also has the incentive to set smaller caps and higher overage charges than when caps are used only to ensure that heavy users pay for their usage. Finally, we analyze the impact of data caps on ISP duopoly competition. In the duopoly competition model, users seek to maximize their surplus by making their ISP subscription choices and by controlling the time devoted to Internet activities. ISPs seek to maximize their profits by competing through their <b>tier</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>tier</b> rates, network capacities, data caps and overage charges. We illustrate how users' utilities are affected by data caps, and the resulting impact upon ISP market shares. We show that both ISPs have an incentive to use data caps and overage charges to ensure that heavy users pay at least an amount equal to the cost of their usage. The initial incentives for both ISPs to update their <b>tier</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>tier</b> rates given the newly added data caps are also predicted under different scenarios. The final Nash equilibrium with data caps for profit maximization is analyzed through simulation, and compared to the Nash equilibrium without data caps. The corresponding changes in ISP profits, user subscription choices, and user surpluses are illustrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> - {{the concept}} of selling drugs and {{vaccines}} in developing countries at prices systematically lower than in industrialized countries - has received widespread support from industry, policymakers, civil society, and academics {{as a way to}} improve access to medicines for the poor. We carried out case studies based on a review of international drug price developments for antiretrovirals, artemisinin combination therapies, drug-resistant tuberculosis medicines, liposomal amphotericin B (for visceral leishmaniasis), and pneumococcal vaccines. Discussion We found several critical shortcomings to tiered pricing: it is inferior to competition for achieving the lowest sustainable prices; it often involves arbitrary divisions between markets and/or countries, which can lead to very high prices for middle-income markets; and it leaves a disproportionate amount of decision-making {{power in the hands of}} sellers vis-à-vis consumers. In many developing countries, resources are often stretched so tight that affordability can only be approached by selling medicines at or near the cost of production. Policies that "de-link" the financing of R&D from the price of medicines merit further attention, since they can reward innovation while exploiting robust competition in production to generate the lowest sustainable prices. However, in special cases - such as when market volumes are very small or multi-source production capacity is lacking - <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> may offer the only practical option to meet short-term needs for access to a product. In such cases, steps should be taken to ensure affordability and availability in the longer-term. Summary To ensure access to medicines for populations in need, alternate strategies should be explored that harness the power of competition, avoid arbitrary market segmentation, and/or recognize government responsibilities. Competition should generally be the default option for achieving affordability, as it has proven superior to <b>tiered</b> <b>pricing</b> for reliably achieving the lowest sustainable prices. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} competitive pricing strategies of apparel brands and retailers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a broad discussion of competition by examining Porter’s five forces model, and narrows by examining price competition within <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> in the retail apparel industry according to store format and brands. Included are case studies of apparel retailers and brands incorporating concepts of pricing strategies, brand positioning, and price competition, with a focus on retail channel relationships. The paper analyzes the impact of price competition on apparel retailers and brands, and further examines <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> as a competitive strategy. Findings – The study reveals that the concept of <b>price</b> <b>tiers</b> is applicable to apparel retailers and brands. <b>Price</b> <b>tiering</b> is a vehicle for market positioning for the retail apparel industry. Retailers are enacting a <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> strategy by branding their retail store formats or engaging store brands as a vehicle of differentiation for a tier. Retailers and brands can be successful with a <b>price</b> <b>tier</b> strategy, unless they fail to differentiate between tiers on factors other than on price alone. Research limitations/implications – The lack of relevant price competition literature, relating to the retailer apparel industry, forced the exploration of price competition literature from grocery and automotive sectors.
