5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same <b>thread.</b> <b>Part</b> of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

To make {{one of his favorite}} pieces, 3 Standard Stoppages (3 stoppages étalon), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter. The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box. Three small leather signs with the title printed in gold were glued to each of the [...] "stoppage" [...] backgrounds. The piece appears to literally follow Poincaré's School of the <b>Thread,</b> <b>part</b> of a book on classical mechanics.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} {{technology}} of screw spikes manufacturing, {{based on the}} flashless forging and hot rolling in double configuration, is presented. The forging takes place in closed dies and the obtained workpiece is rolled in its middle part on cross-wedge rolling mill {{in order to make}} screw thread. As the result of this process, it is possible to eliminate disadvantages of the former technology: flash and groove on the head surface of the workpiece <b>thread</b> <b>part.</b> The new technology designing based on computer simulations and experimental research, which considerably lowered the costs of implementation. The advantages of using the new technology include: improving the finished product functional quality, increasing of productivity and obtained economic effects. ...|$|E

40|$|Techniques for {{determining}} and correcting <b>threaded</b> <b>part</b> alignment using force and angular position data are developed to augment currently limited techniques for align- ing <b>threaded</b> <b>parts.</b> These new techniques {{are based on}} backspinning a nut {{with respect to a}} bolt and measuring the force change that occurs when the bolt "falls" into the nut. Kinematic models that describe the relationship between <b>threaded</b> <b>parts</b> during backspinning are introduced and are used to show how angular alignment may be determined. The models indicate how to distinguish between the aligned and misaligned cases of a bolt and a nut connection by using axial force data only. In addition, by tracking the in-plane relative attitude of the bolt during spinning, data can be obtained on the direction of the angular misalignment which, in turn, is used to correct the misalignment. Results from experiments using a bolt held in a specialized fixture and a three fingers Stanford/JPL hand are presented...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} a method to {{regulate}} the releases from a waterreservoir. The researched method makes daily outflow decisions. The method is called the FTAIS method (Fil Tendu en Avenir Incertain Simulé; in English : stretched thread method applied to uncertain future). Scenarios are generated to simulate the future inflows into the reservoir. The scenarios consist of daily inflow data. The scenarios are generated, using generated daily rainfall data. The rainfall minus the evapotranspiration (mean daily values are used) is the input into the rainfall-runoff model (GR 3), this model computes the simulated flows into the reservoir. The mass curves of the simulated inflows {{are used in the}} stretched <b>thread</b> <b>part,</b> this stretched <b>thread</b> <b>part</b> is derived from a graphic method (see figure) to compute the flow that is to be released from a reservoir. In former studies (X. YANG; 1989) the average scenario is calculated and used as input into the stretched thread method. In this report variants of the stretched thread method have been studied. To test these variants, the regulation at the reservoir Bar sur Seine is simulated. The principles of the studied variants are: 1. The A-calculation method; Several initial outflows (corresponding to A values) are tested. ' The consequences are calculated for each scenario, if the proposed outflow had been taken at the first day of that scenario. The consequences are expressed using a cost function, the sum of the costs corresponding to one outflow value is calculated. The outflow corresponding to the least sum is selected. 2. Reserve capacity method; The reservoir is divided into three parts. Only one part is used in ' regular situations. In periods when extreme floods or shortages occur, the reserve capacity parts for flood reduction or the part for flow augmentation are also used. A combination of both methods is also tested. These new variants result in a better regulation (a lower standard deviation of the regulated flows) than the original method, but the new methods are more complicated and time consuming than the original one. The influence of the upstream riverbasin area and the reservoir capacity is also investigated. Larger reservoirs and larger riverbasins result in lower standard deviations (expressed in mm/day- flow divided by the riverbasin area) of the regulated flows. The simulations with several reservoir capacities can be useful to determine the optimum regulation method and the capacity, when it is decided that a reservoir will be constructed. The desired characteristics of the outflows (standard deviation, probability of occurence of extreme regulated flows) might determine the needed capacity.

40|$|Para avaliar o compósito hidroxiapatita-lignina na osseointegração entre implante metálico e o tecido ósseo, foram utilizados 20 coelhos adultos, nos quais foi realizada uma falha óssea na face lateral {{proximal}} de ambas as tíbias. Na tíbia esquerda, introduziu-se, no canal medular, um pino intramedular de Schanz revestido com o compósito em sua parte rosqueada, após o preenchimento daquele com 1000 mg do compósito. A falha cortical foi preenchida com o compósito. O mesmo foi feito na tíbia direita, porém sem a utilização do compósito, servindo como controle. A avaliação clínica baseou-se na deiscência, claudicação, sensibilidade dolorosa e circunferência tibial. Foram realizadas radiografias imediatamente após a cirurgia e aos oito, 30, 60, 90 e 120 dias do pós-operatório. A maioria dos animais apresentou evolução clínica normal. Nas radiografias do grupo tratado, houve decréscimo da radiopacidade no defeito e no espaço medular até tornar-se semelhante à do osso circunvizinho, quadro inverso ao do grupo-controle. Conclui-se que o compósito hidroxiapatita-lignina não mostrou indícios clínicos de rejeição e que o tecido visualizado na altura da falha óssea e ao redor do pino intramedular tinha radiopacidade semelhante à do osso circunvizinho, o que sugere que o material promoveu a integração com o tecido ósseo. This study evaluated a sinthetic hydroxyapatite-lignin composite for osseoingration between {{metallic implant}} and bone tissue. Twenty New Zealand rabbits were used.

An intramedullary pin was inserted in the medullary cavity of the left tibia after filling the cavity with 1, 000 mg of the composite and covering the <b>thread</b> <b>part</b> of the pin with the composite. The same procedure was made in control tibias without the composite. Clinical evaluation was based on inflammatory reaction, dehiscence, lameness, pain, and tibial circumference. Radiographs were made immediately after surgery and then on days eight, 30, 60, 90, and 120. Most of the animals presented normal clinical progression. Radiographies of treated group showed decrease in the defect and medullary cavity radiopacity to {{the same pattern of}} the surrounding bone, while the contrary happened in control group; but, in this group, the medullary cavity remained radioluscent at the last observation date. It can be concluded that the hydroxyapatite-lignin composite did not show clinical signs of rejection and that radiopacity of the tissue in the bone defect and surrounding the pin was similar to bone radiopacity, suggesting that the material promoted osseointegration...|$|E

30|$|We {{normally}} start {{increment borer}} by pushing the electric wrench {{and the reaction}} bar to insert the <b>threaded</b> <b>part</b> (the first 3  cm of the tip). When two persons are available, we tilt the reaction bar in horizontal direction, so that each person can push the left or {{the right side of}} the reaction bar. By pressing the cutting edge of the bit against the stem with stronger pressure, we can start the 12  mm borer more easily. However, roughness and thickness of the stem bark often make it difficult to get the borer bit to start engaging, especially when a small and/or inexperienced person tries to start a 12  mm borer on hardwood alone. To solve this problem, we designed a motor-driven socket that can also serve as a winching machine (Fig.  2 g, winch socket). A rope is wrapped around the circumference of the tree trunk, and then put through the eyelets of the winch socket (Fig.  2 top left). After pulling both ends tight, we tie a bow knot to make a loop. Once the winch socket starts driving, the rope winds around the bit until taut and presses the cutting edge of the bit against the stem surface, forcing the bit into the stem (Fig.  2 h, top left). After the <b>threaded</b> <b>part</b> goes inside the stem and fully engages with wood, the rope is untied and removed to continue coring.|$|R
