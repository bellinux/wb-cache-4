I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also {{went through a lot}} of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

[...] They left there on April 7, 1805 and came within view of the Pacific Ocean, near Astoria, Oregon, on November 7. [...] After exploring the area, they departed eastward on March 23, 1806 and arrived in St. Louis six months to the day later. [...] Only one of the expedition members died en route, most likely of appendicitis. While they did not find the mammoths or salt mountains reputed to be in the American West, [...] "these were a small loss compared to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> gained". In addition to knowledge of the territories purchased by the US, these included the establishment of relations with Native Americans and increased public interest in the West once their diaries were published.

[...] The effect of the Velvet Underground gave rock musicians like Iggy Pop of the Stooges a self-consciousness about their work. Iggy was inspired to transform his personality into an art object, which would in turn influence singer David Bowie, {{and led to the}} Stooges' role as the group linking 1960s hard rock to 1970s punk. In the 1970s, a similarly self-conscious art/pop community (which Frith calls [...] "the most significant" [...] of the period) began to coalesce in the Mercer Arts Center in New York. The school encouraged the continuation of the kinds of collaboration between high and low art once exemplified by the Factory, as drummer Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads) explained: [...] "it started with the Velvet Underground and all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> identified with Andy Warhol." ...|$|E

He added that [...] "one {{of the things that}} we talked about is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> and could be a problem for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really spent a lot of time exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take on something that is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
500|$|Following Die Another Day, Madonna {{collaborated with}} fashion {{photographer}} Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from {{a photo shoot}} in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, {{which was based on}} her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, [...] " [...] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> important to me." [...] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that [...] "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" [...] while condemning it as [...] "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously." [...] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.|$|E

500|$|His {{characters}} are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed; {{in addition to}} the larger themes of corruption and conspiracy. By grounding [...] "everyday neurosis – our everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves" [...] in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience. The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous. In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through these clashings of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth. The director also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, [...] "From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to just always be driven by <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> important to me." [...] Writing for The Playlist, Oliver Lyttelton singled out parenthood as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding; [...] "the director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from Batman Begins onwards (previous films, it should be said, pre-dated the birth of his kids)." ...|$|E
2500|$|While doing {{press for}} Twin Peaks, he was again {{asked if he}} was retired from film and {{confirmed}} that he had made his last feature film, responding, [...] "Things changed a lot...

Lynch later clarified that this statement had been misconstrued, and reiterated [...] "I did not say I quit cinema. Simply that nobody knows what the future holds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early Christian {{writers such}} as Clement of Alexandria and Firmicus denigrated Athena as {{representative}} of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> detestable about paganism; they condemned her as [...] "immodest and immoral". During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena {{were given to the}} Virgin Mary, who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the Gorgoneion. Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos; one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of Constantinople when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight. During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory; she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.|$|E

And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E

[...] During the confirmation hearings, Alito disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: [...] "I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly." [...] During Alito's Senate confirmation hearings, his wife, Martha Ann Alito, broke into tears after Republicans expressed their disapproval of how Alito was being characterized by some Democrats on the panel.|$|E

And if Elijah told Ezra {{that he had done}} well in writing them, then Ezra would erase the points over them.

2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash {{at the time that he}} gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said to entail the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E
