5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core {{issue for the}} Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E

By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E

5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
5|$|Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while {{practicing}} as {{an emergency}} physician. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint {{the source of his}} illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, but despite the efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of accelerant in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Michael Farrar's intractable illness had been ricin, a poison served to him in his food by Green.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} proton flux {{expected}} {{from a local}} <b>source</b> or <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) {{in the presence of}} regular extragalactic magnetic fields. It is assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>source(s)</b> <b>of</b> ultra-high energy protons, the observer and the magnetic field are all in a wall of matter concentration with dimensions characteristic of the supergalactic plane. For such configurations, the observed proton flux and the local cosmic ray energy spectrum depend strongly on the strength of the field and the orientation of the field relative to the observer's line of sight. We discuss <b>the</b> possibility <b>that</b> such effects could contribute to the excess of UHECR above $ 5. 10 ^{ 19 }$ eV, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> such particles may be missed if such magnetic fields are not taken into account...|$|R
