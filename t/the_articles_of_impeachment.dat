25|$|On March 23, Tupas and company, {{including}} the two leading complainants, personally {{submitted to the}} Senate <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Impeachment.</b> Later that day, the Senate adopted its rules for impeachment, adopting the rules used in the 2000 impeachment of Joseph Estrada with amendments such as maintaining {{the silence of the}} visitors and neutrality among the senators.|$|E
2500|$|After a recess, the Senate {{debated the}} vote on <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> Under <b>the</b> Illinois Constitution, a two-thirds majority, or 41 votes out of 59, was {{required}} to convict him on <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> After several hours of deliberations, Rod Blagojevich was convicted and removed from office by a unanimous vote of 59–0. [...] State Senator Mike Frerichs then moved that Blagojevich be banned from ever holding office in Illinois again. [...] This motion carried, also by a unanimous vote of 59–0. Shortly after the vote, the lieutenant governor, Pat Quinn {{was sworn in as}} the new Governor. Although Blagojevich is disqualified from running for any Government of Illinois office, he is eligible to run for federal office such as his old congressional seat.|$|R

A vote of at least two-thirds (16) of all senators (24) is required to convict Gutierrez and remove her from office.

25|$|Also, the House {{will adopt}} a {{resolution}} {{in order to}} notify the Senate of its action.

5000|$|In 1804, Chase {{became the}} first, and only, Justice of the Supreme Court impeached by the House. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> focused on <b>the</b> justice's conduct in the New Castle Court House. Delaware's U.S. Representative Caesar A.

25|$|Former Texas Governor James E. Ferguson, who was {{forbidden}} by <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> from holding office, put his homemaker wife Miriam A. Ferguson {{up as the}} Democratic candidate in the 1924 gubernatorial election. That turn of events prompted Cunningham to support Republican candidate George C. Butte. Cunningham served {{as chair of the}} Texas League of Women Voters (TLWV) Committee on Prison Reform. She was {{also a member of the}} Texas Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor (CPPL), hoping to reform the Texas practice of incarcerating prisoners as cotton plantation labor. In 1925, CPPL's Elizabeth Speer named Cunningham to chair a committee to present the findings of a National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor to the state legislature. Governor Miriam Ferguson vetoed the CPPL's recommendation of taking the prisoners off the plantations and housing them in a new facility to be built in Austin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{committee}} {{sent two}} resolutions to the House, HR 52 and HR 53 respectively, recommending that no article of impeachment be brought against Supreme Court justice Sherman D.

25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|R

2500|$|Drinan was {{the first}} member of Congress, in July 1973, to {{introduce}} a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon, though not for the Watergate Scandal that ultimately ended Nixon's presidency. Drinan believed that Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia was illegal, and as such, constituted a [...] "high crime and misdemeanor." [...] However, the Judiciary Committee voted 21 to 12 against including that charge among <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> that were eventually approved and reported out to the full House of Representatives. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Drinan played an integral role in the Congressional investigation of Nixon administration misdeeds and crimes.|$|E
2500|$|The state {{constitution}} {{does not provide}} for the level of evidence required to determine whether such conduct is impeachable, {{or the number of}} votes required to convict, unlike the U.S. Constitution. [...] The Senate conducted a three-week trial and ultimately acquitted Brock of all charges, finding the charges were not serious enough to warrant impeachment or that the evidence presented at trial was not persuasive. The Senate chose to require a two-thirds vote to convict, but let each senator to decide for themselves if the evidence rose to the level of finding Brock was [...] "guilty" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> [...] Fifteen senators were needed for a conviction, only seven voted to convict and fifteen voted to acquit.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was principally the {{military}} disasters in Scotland which caused {{the impeachment of}} Strafford, his conduct of Irish affairs and, in particular, his administration of justice {{formed the basis for}} many of <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> brought against him; and Irish witnesses like Crosby and Esmonde whom he had offended, testified against him. At the same time the Irish Parliament led by the Catholic lawyer Patrick D'Arcy drew up a remonstrance [...] to the [...] Irish Privy Council called the Queries; this stopped short of demanding the abolition of Castle Chamber but raised grave questions about the legality of its proceedings. The Councillors, most of whom had been allies of Strafford, found themselves unable to answer the Queries. In 1641, the year of Strafford's execution and the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion, [...] Castle Chamber simply ceased to operate and although it still existed in theory after the Restoration, no [...] effort was made to revive it.|$|E

2500|$|Rodney served six {{terms as}} State Representative, from the 1797 session through the 1802 session. There {{he became one}} of the leaders of the Jeffersonian party, now known as the Democratic-Republican Party. Encouraged by Jefferson to compete for the U.S. House against the staunch Federalist James A. Bayard, Rodney ran and won a lively {{campaign}} by fifteen votes. While in the U.S. House, he was a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and established a national reputation as one of the managers appointed in January 1804 to prepare <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> against John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for New Hampshire. Pickering was charged with conduct unbecoming a judge, and his acquittal was viewed as strengthening the independence of the judiciary. [...] In December of the same year, Rodney led another such case against Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Boutwell {{opposed the}} Reconstruction {{policies}} of President Andrew Johnson {{from the first}} weeks of his administration. Arguing that any remaking of the former Confederate governments must begin with steps to open the electorate to blacks as well as whites, he warned that black rights and loyal Unionists' safety could be protected in no other way. In time, he turned {{into one of the}} most militant advocates of Johnson's impeachment, and by far the most respected of them. Unlike his colleagues, a hostile observer wrote, he brought to the cause [...] "the advantage of a cultivated mind, an extensive reading and a scholarly acquaintance with all of history that could be mustered into such a service." [...] In December 1867, he made the case for impeaching the president without charging him with having committed actual crimes— contending, in effect, that impeachment was a political, and not just a judicial process. (He did not expect impeachment to pass and did not foresee the Senate convicting Johnson; what he hoped for, instead, was a statement on the House's part that the president had committed high crimes and misdemeanors, in effect a resolution of censure). The House did not agree, but two months later, in February 1868, Johnson's removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (in contravention of a law drafted by Stanton and Boutwell requiring Senate confirmation of such acts) united Republicans behind a resolution of impeachment. [...] Boutwell chaired the committee that drafted <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> and presented them to the House for debate. He was chosen as one of the managers of the impeachment proceedings that followed.|$|E
