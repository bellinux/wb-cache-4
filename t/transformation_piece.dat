To determine the efficiency of sawed wood, the pieces of wood were classified in groups of eight diametric categories and seven of conical shape. The study of time and movement included analysis of observations per sampling in intervals of two minutes to the three principal sections of the sawmill (saw, edge banding machine, and circular saw). When the pieces of wood were processed, 1875 planks were generated with a 19. 05 mm of thickness; the production was evaluated in third and fourth class which was located with the decimal metric system, symbolizing 30. 12 m 3 of sawed wood. The coefficient of progress rate was 44. 18 % with and without bark, indicating that from every 1 m 3 r without bark, 216 of sawed wood is processed and to obtain 1000 pt, 4. 62 meters m 3 r of woodrollsare is required.

Based on the outstanding performance of Mobius <b>transformation</b> on modifying <b>pieces</b> with monotonic parametric speed, we first create a partition of the original curve, in which the parametric speed of each segment is of monotonic variation. The values of new parameters corresponding to the subdivision points are specified a priori as the ratio of its cumulative arc length and its total arc length.

While composing the soundtrack I was fascinated by the intricate sonic details present in the closely recorded paper and was keen to explore their potential further in a standalone acousmatic concert work. As a result, Papyrus explores the wide variety of spatial motions, trajectories and perspectives which can be created through the manipulation of this seemingly simple and lifeless material.

40|$|Strobilation is {{a process}} in which a polyp makes {{segments}} and each of them becomes ephyra. The present study dealt with the morphogenesis of the pieces which were isolated from the different horizontal level of polyp and strobilae at different stages of strobilation in Aurelia. Any piece cut from polyp could easily reconstitute a complete polyp, but it from strobilae at advanced stage would not reform the one but alternatively gave rise to ephyra. Loss of such polyp reconstititing potency was found to be a graduation property from distal to proximal of the body. However, even in a certain segment that might form ephyra, if vertically cut into more smaller size, the small segment would not show a normal way to ephyra but resume polyp characteristics eventually. During the course of such transformation, the samll segment would bring about firstly a disto-proximal difference and followed by apperance of two or four tentacles, which may be an indication of re-establishment of a radial symmetry in it. Either process, the regneneration in polyp <b>piece</b> or the <b>transformation</b> from ephyra characteristics to polyp ones, should seem to involve cellular interactions by which reguratory mechanisms would be able to operate in reconstituting a whole or part of a whole.

That kind of hype can often be misleading, but in this case it's quite likely accurate. The 45-minute, three-movement work, which encompasses various meanings of play — some lighthearted, some sinister — begins in an almost spastic fit of energy; musical ideas ricochet off one another furiously, almost too quickly.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} BIND (Binding Instructions aNd Data), 1 a {{fine-grained}} attestation service for securing distributed systems. Code attestation has recently received considerable attention in trusted computing. However, current code attestation technology is relatively immature. First, {{due to the}} great variability in software versions and configurations, verification of the hash is difficult. Second, the time-of-use and time-of-attestation discrepancy remains to be addressed, since the code may be correct {{at the time of}} the attestation, but it may be compromised by the time of use. The goal of BIND is to address these issues and make code attestation more usable in securing distributed systems. BIND offers the following properties: 1) BIND performs fine-grained attestation. Instead of attesting to the entire memory content, BIND attests only to the piece of code we are concerned about. This greatly simplifies verification. 2) BIND narrows the gap between time-ofattestation and time-of-use. BIND measures a piece of code immediately before it is executed and uses a sand-boxing mechanism to protect the execution of the attested code. 3) BIND ties the code attestation with the data that the code produces, such that we can pinpoint what code has been run to generate that data. In addition, by incorporating the verification of input data integrity into the attestation, BIND offers transitive integrity verification, i. e., through one signature, we can vouch for the entire chain of processes that have performed <b>transformations</b> over a <b>piece</b> of data. BIND offers a general solution toward establishing a trusted environment for distributed system designers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} mashup culture in general can be dated {{back to the}} {{beginnings}} of dada and conceptual art. Artists such as Marcel Duchamp {{were the first to}} introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in collages, to the world of higher art. [...] These artists believed that even though certain artifacts were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context. However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music. From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet. With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music. Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before. Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom {{when it came to the}} accessibility of audio files lead to the development of a new form of cult around the <b>transformation</b> of musical <b>pieces.</b> This [...] "reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet" [...] was turning into more than just a fashion just as [...] "the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a raison d’eˆtre for a culture based on audio data’’ states Alistair Riddell in 2001. During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term mashup but under the name of [...] "creative bootleg" [...] or [...] "bastard pop". Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as Hip Hop before, it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such. Especially peer-to-peer sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.|$|R

When a piece takes [...] "damage", its base is turned a number of [...] "clicks" [...] clockwise, revealing altered stats to correspond to the damage it has taken from an attack. Most damage weakens characters, although some actually get stronger when wounded, to represent a <b>transformation</b> or rage. <b>Pieces</b> have an overall point value assigned, representing how powerful they are. Team creation is restricted to a predetermined total point value for the HeroClix figures, which is usually in multiples of 100. The Range value indicates how far away a character can attack another character and if they are able to attack multiple characters at once, generally defined based on the powers of each figure. Originally, characters would appear in multiple rarities with altered statistics. These altered stats represented the [...] "Experience" [...] of the character, ranging from [...] "Rookie" [...] (yellow ring on base) over [...] "Experienced" [...] (blue ring) to [...] "Veteran" [...] (red ring), (although this is no longer used) the more experienced a character is the higher the stats usually are.

The trait symbol corresponds to a character's Character Card. A Character Card is a card specific to a particular HeroClix character. If for some reason you do not have the corresponding Character Card for your miniature, it is available through the Print and Play System on the WizKids Website. Character cards outline which abilities the character will have on its dial, but does not say where they will be on the dial. Also, it shows special traits and abilities would otherwise be too complex to communicate on the Combat Dial. Many of these abilities are completely unique to the characters that possess them.|$|R
40|$|A current {{research}} {{area of the}} German Aerospace Center’s Institute of Flight Guidance constitutes {{the concept of an}} Adaptive Vision Based System for Air Traffic Control Towers. The concept envisions an assistance system that fuses adaptive integrated information management with augmented vision by projecting critical flight data into the controller’s outside view according to the current operational context and environmental conditions. As a first step two concept studies were conducted in a 360 ° Tower Simulator in 2016 and 2017 examining the various operational and functional requirements for the envisioned prototype. In a second step, the results of the concept studies will be transferred to augmented reality glasses such as the Microsoft HoloLens or the ODG 7. One challenge relates to the correct alignment of augmented aircraft labels within the simulated outside view. Continuous head tracking, a reference that is known in both systems and suitable coordinate <b>transformation</b> are mandatory <b>pieces</b> to provide correct label alignment. This bachelor’s thesis designs a concept that solves the described problem using the Microsoft HoloLens. The thesis consists of four main parts. First, the used technological resources are described briefly. The crucial part of the process to correct label alignment is then split into two parts. The first part covers how the continuous head tracking is performed and how a point can be found that connects the coordinate system of the HoloLens with the coordinate system of the simulated outside world. Based on this reference point the second part is about the transformation of the flight navigation data from the World Geodetic System 1984 coordinates to a Cartesian coordinate system, the east-north-up system. Once this calculation is made the final step of this part is downscaling the east-, north-, up-coordinates to magnitudes that can be displayed by the HoloLens. As the concept includes different solution approaches, a conclusion will be reached, which methods in the different stages form the most feasible and promising solution for correct aircraft label alignment. This method is then developed, tested and evaluated against criteria like precision, performance and label stability. The thesis proceeds with a critical discussion of the concept to get an overview of the limitations and constraints, which need to be addressed in subsequent work. Concluding, an outlook will be drawn, consisting of future challenges for the project on the way to using AR technology in real tower environments...|$|R
40|$|Two major {{research}} approaches {{have been used}} to study the tuber-related gene expressions in different Solanaceous species. The first part of the research is using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation to study potato proteinase inhibitor II (pinII) gene which highly expressed in developing tuber in a wild nontuberizing specie Solanum brevidens. To establish the <b>transformation</b> system, leaf <b>pieces</b> of in-vitro cultured S. brevidens were cocultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens that contained nptII and GUS genes on the disarmed plasmid pBI 121. Independent transgenic shoots were regenerated from both solidified and liquid medium with kanamycin. Agrobacterium strains GV 2260 resulted in a higher transformation frequency than LBA 4404. All kanamycin-resistant, putatively transformed plantlets were confirmed positive by GUS assays. Southern analysis of randomly selected transgenic plants showed that each transgenic plant contained at least one copy of the GUS gene. S. brevidens were then cocultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV 2260 with pinII-GUS fusion gene on the disarmed plasmid pRT 210. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products followed by Southern blot hybridization demonstrated the presence of GUS genes in three of the transforments. Transgenic plants were tested for methyl jasmonate, sucrose, and wounding induction of the pinII-GUS gene at the RNA and protein level using leaf-petiole cuttings and whole plants. Northern blot analysis showed the pinII-GUS transgene in the transgenic plant can be induced by methyl jasmonate and sucrose. Wounding of transgenic S. brevidens leaves on whole plants resulted in high expression of GUS activity both locally and systemically;The second approach is to study the expression of cathepsin D inhibitor genes which is also expressed in developing tuber in both tuberizing and nontuberizing species using blot hybridization. Three Solanaceous species, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), potato (S. tuberosum cv. Superior) and S. brevidens, were tested for MJ induction at the RNA level using a petiole/leaf system. The results of this study showed that the cathepsin D inhibitor is induced by MJ. A dose response test was performed for MJ induction of CDI in the leaves of petiole/leaf cuttings. For Superior and tomato, both had highest level of expression at 50 [mu]M. The maximum expression level for S. brevidens was at 500 [mu]M MJ. The induction of MJ was also dependent on the duration of exposure. Twelve hours of incubation were enough to give relatively abundant accumulation for all three species. There is no light/dark effect on MJ induction from 0 to 48 hours for either Superior or S. brevidens. But it has a slight decrease of expression using tomato leaf samples in the same treatment. Leaf samples of Superior and S. brevidens were also treated with 50 [mu]M of GA either before or after MJ treatment to observe the interaction of these two hormones. GA had no effect on the MJ induction of CDI expression in either Superior or S. brevidens. Immunoblot analysis showed CDI proteins were induced in 2 ̆ 7 Superior 2 ̆ 7 leaves after MJ treatment...|$|R
