5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the structure, the energetic, and the {{strength}} of a symmetric tilt grain boundary in magnesium and magnesium binary alloys were analyzed in the framework of (semi-) empirical potentials. Following a systematic investigation of the transferability and accuracy of the interatomic potentials, atomistic calculations of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary energy, <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary sliding energy, and <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary strength were performed in pure magnesium and in binary MgX alloys (X = Al, Ca, Gd, Li, Sn, Y, Ag, Nd, and Pb).

From <b>the</b> methodology perspective, the role of in-plane and out-of plane relaxation on <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary sliding energy curves was investigated. In pure magnesium, the results showed that in-plane relaxation is critical in activating twinning dislocation resulting in grain boundary migration. In the alloy systems, however, grain boundary migration was disabled {{as a consequence of the}} pinning of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary by segregated elements. Finally, while <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary energy, <b>the</b> shape of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary sliding energy curves, and <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary sliding energy are critical parameters controlling <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary strength in pure magnesium, only <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary energy and the segregation energy of the alloying elements at <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary were identified as critical material parameters in the alloys system...|$|R

Dowel diameters were 8, 12, 16, and 20 mm. Embedding strength was evaluated by the 5 % off-set method and a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383. The embedding strength parallel to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> evaluated by <b>the</b> former method showed values close to those obtained with the latter method, but they showed a significant difference in tests conducted perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> <b>The</b> embedding strength parallel to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> was 0.9 times as large as the compressive strength parallel to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> regardless of <b>the</b> evaluation method.

5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet.

5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers.

40|$|<b>Grain</b> {{growth by}} <b>the</b> {{accretion}} of metals in interstellar clouds (called `grain growth') {{could be one}} of the dominant processes that determine the dust content in galaxies. <b>The</b> importance of <b>grain</b> size distribution for <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth is demonstrated in this paper. First, we derive an analytical formula that gives <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution after <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth in individual clouds for any initial <b>grain</b> size distribution. <b>The</b> time-scale of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth is very sensitive to grain size distribution, since <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth is mainly regulated by the surface to volume ratio of grains. Next, we implement <b>the</b> results of <b>grain</b> growth into dust enrichment models of entire galactic system along with <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> formation and destruction in the interstellar medium, finding that <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth in clouds governs the dust content in nearby galaxies unless <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> size is strongly biased to sizes larger than ∼ 0. 1 or the power index of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution is shallower than ∼ - 2. 5. <b>The</b> <b>grain</b> growth in clouds contributes to the rapid increase of dust-to-gas ratio at a certain metallicity level (called critical metallicity in Asano et al. 2011 and and Inoue 2011), which we find to be sensitive to grain size distribution. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> growth efficiently increase the dust mass not only in nearby galaxies but also in high-redshift quasars, whose metallicities are larger than the critical value.

25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes take place in <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> less likely to tear and break down.

As grain growth proceeds from an initially random distribution, <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary character distribution reaches a steady state that depends on <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary energy. If the energy depends only on the lattice misorientation, then the population and energy are related by the Boltzmann distribution.
