500|$|A {{few days}} before Whiteside {{was old enough to}} sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United, he was offered a trial at Liverpool, causing United's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to Belfast to {{immediately}} offer him the schoolboy contract to sign. Whiteside remained in Belfast, and flew over to Manchester every weekend for training. From age 14, he was constantly compared to the now-retired George Best, and did little to cease such comparisons when he told a journalist that [...] "the only thing I have in common with George Best is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> from the same place, play for the same club and were discovered by the same man".|$|E
500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she {{suffered}} from her disillusionment with Mormonism [...] "had {{to do with the}} pain I caused my family. [...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man Knows My History was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you." [...] Brodie's mother and three sisters were enthusiastic about the book, but Thomas McKay refused to read it.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{disagreed}} with his teacher, Plato, in several important respects. [...] While Aristotle agreed that truth must be eternal and unchanging, he maintained <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to know the}} truth through the external world which we perceive with our senses. [...] For Aristotle, directly observable things are real; ideas (or as he called them, forms) only exist as they express themselves in matter, such as in living things, or in the mind of an observer or artisan.|$|E
60|$|The teacher {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to beg <b>that</b> Avatea {{might be}} spared.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just the}} other way, sir," [...] Bob said, [...] "and it is very lucky for us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in here, sir, instead of {{going up to the}} Common, as we intended. One of the ushers found out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had gone, and sat up until <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back and, {{if it had not been}} for you, we should not only have got a thrashing, but should all have been expelled; so it is the luckiest thing {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much shorter, Roger; but Sir Henry {{thought it}} better <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go inland to Haddington, and thence east to Dunbar; as, thus {{entering}} the town, {{it would seem}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from Edinburgh, or from some western monastery; whereas, did we journey by the coast road, it might be guessed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had <b>come</b> from England." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{piece is}} a {{meditation}} on death. Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that [...] "how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence." [...] It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It suggests <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> from silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that before we were born and after we die we are silent {{with respect to this}} world.|$|E
2500|$|While Mezzamorphis is not {{strictly}} a concept album, {{more than one}} professional reviewer {{has pointed out that}} there is a general theme of getting to heaven running through the whole work. The band have confirmed this, and have also pointed out a theme of change. [...] "Heaven", inspired by the troubles in Northern Ireland, ties the two themes of heaven and change together; according to Smith, [...] "we have to come to realize <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> from the dust, yet we believe one day we'll meet Jesus. In the meantime, we're caught between two worlds. Heaven is my home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{convenience}} {{that social}} network sites give users {{to communicate with}} one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the {{founder and director of the}} MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, [...] "Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing". Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, [...] "They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends. They become confused about companionship".|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever since I {{was seven}} years old. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> there in a waggon. Before <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from England--from Oxfordshire; I can show you the place on a big map. It is called Garsingham." ...|$|R
2500|$|Moore {{rejects the}} theory of evolution, saying [...] "There {{is no such thing}} as evolution. <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from a snake? No, I don’t believe that".|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't quite all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to say," [...] Forrest remarked coldly. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth we have had enough of playing jailer." ...|$|R
2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth have we done <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is of war <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to speak," [...] {{replied the}} messenger, diplomatically {{avoiding}} {{the other two}} topics which perhaps he found it awkward to discuss.|$|E
6000|$|It {{says that}} Life would signify [...] A thwarted purposing: <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to live, and {{are called to}} die, [...] Yes, that's the thing [...] In fall, in spring, [...] That Yell'ham says:- [...] "Life offers--to deny!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We hev that, sir," [...] {{said the}} old elder, shaking him warmly by the hand; [...] "but <b>we</b> don't heed <b>that,</b> an' <b>we</b> are fery glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came,</b> what-e-ver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have read}} about him," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I found {{a book about}} him in a {{steamboat}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in, and I read all about his coming to Holland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{sergeant}} an' Noel, lad, an' right glad am I <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{to know each}} other just as we did, else would your blood have been on our hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Near to nightfall, however, {{when we were}} come to that three-gun battery {{which stood}} just above where Fort Brookline was {{afterward}} built, the sentinel made peremptory demand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> on shore and {{give an account of}} ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must take}} our chances {{in the first}} dense thicket, wherein may be found a stout tree, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> across," [...] he replied, [...] "an' now instead of tryin' to get a sight of the fortification, turn all your efforts toward findin' a hidin'-place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't mind, Lady Franks, if I said {{nasty things}} about {{my wife and}} {{found a lot of}} fault with her. What makes you angry is that I know it is not a bit more her fault than mine, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> apart. It can't be helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it's for <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to you, old shrew!" [...] {{replied the}} other. [...] "Who {{else is there}} but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now if {{he takes}} cold, it won't be my fault." [...] Then she stopped, clasped her hands, and said, [...] "Oh! what a lovely night. I am glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out here." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was on our}} {{way back}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> upon the dead rabbit. The red body of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs {{stripped}} white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed.|$|R
60|$|Luc. Provided we {{destroy the}} enemy, {{we do not}} value their dead bodies: But you, perhaps, are in your first error, and think we are rather captives than warriors; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> like prisoners to the grate, to beg the charity of {{passengers}} for their love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost {{anything}} will please me so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to a halt}} speedily, for I'm well-nigh winded," [...] I replied, {{speaking with}} difficulty because of my heavy breathing, and in another instant we three stood facing {{each other in the}} thicket, where as yet the light of a new day had not penetrated.|$|E
60|$|Under {{almost any}} other {{circumstances}} we would have made at least a short stop at Benedict; {{but now it was}} out of the question, and we sailed by at full speed, being hailed by several of our acquaintances who urged <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to for a moment, but we resisted all such entreaties.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} in the early {{afternoon}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> down again across the meandering ice-water streams to our old boat, and pushed off and rowed slowly out of that magic corner back to every-day again....|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't cry, Bella," [...] said Mary Bell, in a {{soothing}} tone. [...] "It is {{no matter if}} we can't get out, for your mother knows <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> here, and if <b>we</b> don't <b>come</b> home in an hour, she will come for us and let us out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{up with the}} two in a ditch, {{and that there was}} a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not by {{acquaintance}} {{only is it}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to knowledge. There {{are ways}} of learning other than by the road of experience. One may learn of dangers by watching others perish. It is the fool who will be satisfied alone {{with the knowledge that}} comes to him from what he undergoes himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'These here tools,' said Mark, {{bringing}} forward Martin's case {{of instruments}} and sticking the compasses upright in a stump before the door, 'shall be {{set out in}} the open air to show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> provided. And now, if any gentleman wants a house built, he'd better give his orders, afore we're other ways bespoke.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Isolani. Add this too, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> not empty-handed. [...] At Donauwert[600:2] it was {{reported}} to us, [...] A Swedish caravan {{was on its way}} [...] 5 [...] Transporting a rich cargo of provision, [...] Almost six hundred waggons. This my Croats [...] Plunged down upon and seized, this weighty prize!---- [...] We bring it hither---- ...|$|E
5000|$|Fourthmic gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was another strong one of the season and that [...] "episode has seen the series return to the quality <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to {{appreciate}} in the first couple of seasons." ...|$|R
60|$|Q. How doth {{it appear}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{into the world}} polluted?--A. We are the fruit of an unclean thing, are defiled in our very conception, and are by nature the {{children}} of wrath (Job 14:4; Psa 51:5; Eph 2:3).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is the end}} of a {{very bad}} nightmare, and I am glad enough <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> here and found out the truth, for had we not done so I should never have been happy in my mind." ...|$|R
