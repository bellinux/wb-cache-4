5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

500|$|While the Yevon church forbids most machina {{including}} weapons, {{their capital}} Bevelle retains machina {{to ensure its}} dominance. The Al Bhed are seen as dangerous to the Yevon clergy because they use machina and {{pose a threat to}} the church's uncontested control of Spira. The church retains its power by role in using the Final Summoning which results in the sacrifice of the summoner and her guardian to prevent its secrets from being divulged. Though Yevon set up Operation Mi’ihen to instill further loyalty to the teachings by making the Crusaders use machina that would never win against Sin. By the end of Final Fantasy X, the Yevon religion was effectively disbanded once evidence of its corruption was discovered, and its remaining priests volunteered the truth. Half a year later, the moral teachings of Yevon were revitalized {{in the form of the}} New Yevon Party, later led in Final Fantasy X-2 by Praetor Baralai.

500|$|With [...] "Ironic", Morissette denoted {{her support}} for {{same-sex}} marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: [...] "It's meeting {{the man of}} my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband". She commented to USA Today that her support about same-sex unions [...] "goes a step further than clever lyrics." [...] She remarked that [...] " [...] fantasy would now be to marry some of [...] gay couple friends." [...] Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: [...] "I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it {{as a sort of}} spontaneous <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> radio station about a month ago with a couple, and my heart was so with them." [...] Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her iTunes Originals release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, as well for the compilation album Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16 (2004). The song was also performed in a duo with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|To help {{illustrate}} the care {{that must be}} taken in teaching children and to emphasise the necessity of properly directing and managing their attentiveness, Maria Edgeworth drew several comparisons with non-European peoples. In her 1798 book Practical Education she maintained that unnecessarily causing fatigue should be a great concern of educators. In making the point that any mode of instruction that tired the attention was hurtful to children, her reasoning was that people can pay attention only to one <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and because children can appear resistant to repetition, teachers naturally should vary things. However, educators should always be mindful of the fact that, [...] "while variety relieves the mind, the objects which are varied must not all be entirely new, for novelty and variety when joined, fatigue the mind" [...] as Edgeworth states. The teaching of children needed to follow carefully considered methods, needed to evidence concern for appropriateness and proper sequencing, {{and needed to be}} guided by consideration from forms of teaching that would be empowering and enabling, not fatiguing or disabling. In Edgeworth's work, the attention of the child appears as a key site for pedagogical work and interventions.|$|E
2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, I do it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
