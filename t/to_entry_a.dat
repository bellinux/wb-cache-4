5000|$|The {{protectionist}} {{policies and}} preferable government treatment granted the chaebol {{the ability to}} exhibit monopolistic behavior. The absence of a market free of intervention meant that [...] "true competition" [...] became a rarity in South Korea. Especially in the era prior to the IMF crisis, the only products available to the Korean people were those made by the chaebol. Therefore the social fabric of the country lacked an entrepreneurship culture. Massive market concentration exists as {{is evident from the}} fact that 80% of the country's GDP is derived from the chaebol. The largest of the group, Samsung, exports 20% of South Korea's goods and services alone. Although no-longer financially supported by the government, these firms have attained economies of scale on such a massive level that it is extremely difficult for a start-up or small medium enterprise (SME) to surmount the high barriers <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> <b>A</b> majority of these smaller companies end up being acquired by the chaebol, only increasing their size and economic dominance. In recent years the trend of selling internationally has been seen among aspiring Korean entrepreneurs.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} reason that affects a banks decision <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> <b>a</b> foreign market is to “follow the customer” also called the defensive hypothesis. Foreign banks building upon the expertise in their home country they can differentiate themselves from their competitors in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to their home country corporate customers. Years of long-lasting relationship have provided the banks with crucial information about the unique financial needs that their clients have, the knowledge of which is unavailable to host country institutions. In addition, through this relationship banks are able to develop a competitive advantage stemming through the lower marginal costs that those banks experience when dealing with loan renewals over their local competitors. Unlike manufacturing where knowledge can be protected through patterns and other means, commercial intelligence can be easily gained by any bank with an interest in starting its operations in specific market or industries. In addition, letting other financial institutions to develop a relationship with its existing corporate clients can result in the loss of market share in the banks home county. In order to prevent this from happening banks are obliged to follow the client by opening an office (branch, subsidiary) abroad themselves in order to defend their unique bank client relationship.|$|E
