5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers,</b> especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} propose that <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers</b> never {{intended}} for District residents {{to have a}} vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states.

5|$|The {{recording}} of the transit is {{seen by many as}} the birth of modern astronomy in Britain. John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three folio volume, Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643.|$|E

50|$|The {{first act}} of the play is just of <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father</b> and his {{customers}} reenacting the assassination, but the second {{act of the}} play focuses on his wife and son. The wife, Lucy, and son, Brazil, are totally separated from <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> Father; {{they do not see}} his performance but only hear it off stage. The wife and son are gravediggers as well, they took up the trade after the impersonator left and became <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father.</b> Brazil, makes a comment referring to his father’s career path saying, “Diggin was his livelihood but fakin was his callin,” (179). Lucy, is constantly telling Brazil of the man his father was and what his favorite things were before he became <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father.</b> But Brazil always responds with, “I was only 5,”. Lucy is not necessarily quizzing Brazil, but wants to reiterate that what his father did for work before as a gravedigger was nothing to be ashamed of, contrary to how his father feels about grave digging, and this impersonating work was not the best decision. <b>The</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father</b> was good at digging graves, he dug them fast and well, calling him a “natural” at it. <b>The</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father</b> is dead to them, because he left them to pursue this reenactment career and has not seen his family in thirty years. Towards the end of the play, Lucy and Brazil go to see <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father</b> after he performs one last reenactment, he is preparing to go to the “Great Beyond”. He is not physically going to the afterlife, but the “Great Beyond” is more a metaphor; because <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father</b> gets up and walks into a coffin where his son then parades his dead body around. The impersonations end with <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Father,</b> Brazil does not pick up where his father left off because his mother was constantly telling him that {{there was nothing wrong with}} being a gravedigger.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, one of <b>the</b> <b>{{founding}}</b> <b>fathers</b> of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek {{was the first}} East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.|$|E
5|$|Few visible {{signs of}} the company remain. The former extent of the Bolckow, Vaughan {{property}} at the Eston Sheet and Galvanizing Works beside the River Tees Dockyard is still marked by boundary stones on Smiths Dock Road, Middlesbrough. The graves of <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> {{of the company and}} of Middlesbrough, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, in St Cuthbert's Churchyard, Marton, were neglected for the whole of the 20th century, and fell into disrepair. The neglect was recognised and the graves refurbished in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers</b> of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E

5|$|The friends, {{followers}} of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self-taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's Rudolphine tables by observation and measurement. In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing {{the size of the}} Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> of British research astronomy.|$|E
5|$|When the Supreme Court was {{established}} in 1789, the first members came from among the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers</b> and were almost uniformly Protestant. Of the 113 justices who have been appointed to the court, 91 have been from various Protestant denominations, 12 have been Catholics (one other justice, Sherman Minton, converted to Catholicism after leaving the Court). Another, Neil Gorsuch, {{was raised in the}} Catholic Church but later attended an Episcopalian church, though without specifying the denomination to which he felt he belonged. Eight have been Jewish and one, David Davis, had no known religious affiliation. Three of the 17 chief justices have been Catholics, and one Jewish justice, Abe Fortas, was unsuccessfully nominated to be chief justice.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{understood}} that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At {{the beginning of the}} war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers,</b> under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, {{on the grounds that it}} was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.|$|E

5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was a keen {{observer}} of {{the proceedings of the}} Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788. He continued publishing new books and pamphlets. His Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski (Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1790), together with his previous Remarks, are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment. In Warnings, he criticised the magnates of Poland and Lithuania, monastic orders and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk. Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is recognized as one of <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> of the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Harrison died in 1791. William Henry {{dropped the}} study of {{medicine}} and used Benjamin's connections with <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers</b> to get a commission in the Army. The seat {{of the federal government}} was then in Philadelphia, and President Washington granted him a commission. Harrison served under Mad Anthony Wayne, fighting against Native Americans in what is now western Ohio. He was promoted to captain and made commander of Fort Washington before returning to civilian life in 1798, disliking garrison duty. He was already seeking another position through his government connections, and the same year was appointed by President John Adams as secretary of the Northwest Territory. The following year, the territorial legislature narrowly elected him the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was separated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made territorial governor by President Adams, a position he would hold for over a decade. Prior to taking office, he bought a large tract of land from his father-in-law, along the Ohio River at North Bend. When Harrison purchased it, there was a log cabin on the property, but by 1840 the structure had been absorbed into the mansion that stood there.|$|E

5|$|As of 2013, the United States Cabinet has had 20 {{appointed}} {{members in}} its history who were born outside the present-day United States. Alexander Hamilton, one of <b>the</b> <b>Founding</b> <b>Fathers</b> who signed the United States Constitution, was the first Cabinet member to be born outside of the United States. Born in Nevis in 1755, Hamilton was appointed by President George Washington as the country's first Secretary of Treasury in 1789. Irish-born James McHenry, who was appointed by Washington as Secretary of War in 1796 and served the same post in John Adams's administration, was the other foreign-born individual in Washington's Cabinet. Albert Gallatin, born in Switzerland (present-day US sovereign embassadorial territory) became the third foreign-born member of the Cabinet when he was named Secretary of Treasury by President Thomas Jefferson. Gallatin, his successor George Campbell, William Duane, Carl Schurz and James Wilson were the only foreign-born members to hold Cabinet positions in the 19th century. In the 20th century, nine foreign-born individuals were appointed to the Cabinet, including German-born Oscar Straus and Mexican-born George Romney (born in present-day sovereign US consulate territory), father of former Governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney. During the tenure of President George W. Bush, three more foreign-born individuals were appointed to the Cabinet—Elaine Chao, Mel Martinez in 2001 and Carlos Gutierrez in 2005. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell was the only foreign-born secretary from 2013 to 2017.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-nineteenth}} century {{portrait}} painting declined as an art. This was {{partly due to the}} advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced. David Octavius Hill (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson he was one of <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>fathers</b> of art photography. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, {{as can be seen in}} his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859–1930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856–1944).|$|E

Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
