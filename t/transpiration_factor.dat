40|$|Weak van der Waals {{attractive}} forces may provide molecular gas pumping on surfaces cooled at sufficiently low temperatures. Cryopumps {{make use of}} a cold surface to adsorb gas molecules. They are usually classed into two families, depending whether they rely on the binding forces between gas molecules and solid surfaces (cryosorption pumps) or on the even weaker forces which bind condensed gas molecules together (condensation pumps). The design features and the possible applications of both types of cryopumps are presented. The peculiar behaviour of condensed hydrogen, i. e. its desorption induced by infrared thermal radiation, is described and discussed. 1. GENERALITIES 1. 1 Gas density and pressure at T ≠ 300 K A gas pressure is defined only if gas molecules present an isotropic distribution of directions and a maxwellian distribution of speeds. Under UHV conditions, pressure gauges do not measure pressure but gas density. If two communicating vessels V 1 and V 2 are kept at different temperatures (T 1 and T 2) the gas densities (d 1 and d 2) and pressures (p 1 and p 2) are given by 2211 p /TT p = 2121 d /TT d = In other words, in the colder vessel the gas density is higher but the pressure is lower. /TT 21 is the thermomolecular <b>transpiration</b> <b>factor.</b> 1. 2 Gas condensation When a surface is "cold enough", the sojourn time of the molecules adsorbed on the surface, {{as defined by the}} Frenkel equatio...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the stomatal opening {{variations}} on the transpiration of the entire canopy in protected crops cultivation. Three effects contribute to a reduction of this impact: a damping effect due to the boundary layer adhering to the leaf, a thermal negative feedback effect linked to the energy balance and a hydric negative feedback effect linked to the water balance. Summing up these effects gives a coupling factor between the relative stomatal conductance changes and the relative transpiration rate modifications. Detailed expression of the coupling factor is established in the frame of a dynamic greenhouse climatic model (GGDM) and its value is calculated for typical days of a temperate climate. The results show that large stomatal conductances are poorly effective in the control of the canopy <b>transpiration</b> (coupling <b>factor</b> =. 1).

40|$|Aims The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of active nickel and cadmium transport, transpiration and shoot biomass production on Ni and Cd accumulation in the leaves of the Ni-hyperaccumulator Leptoplax emarginata. A secondary objective was to observe the effects of various concentrations of nickel and cadmium in solutions on the plant growth and ecophysiological characteristics of these plants. Finally, the study sought to identify possible nickel and cadmium concentration gradients in solution as a function of the root distance. Methods The Intact Plant <b>Transpiration</b> Stream Concentration <b>Factor</b> (TSCF=xylem/solution solute concentration ratio) was determined for both Ni and Cd and for the selected intact transpiring Ni-hyperaccumulator Leptoplax emarginata, cultivated on two contrasting fertilized and Ni-Cd-contaminated sandy porous media (rhizotrons with central root compartments, linked to Mariotte tubes operated at - 1 kPa). IPTSCF(Ni) and IPTSCF(Cd) were calculated as the ratios between the hyperaccumulator plant's nickel or cadmium mass in the leaves and the nickel or cadmium concentration in solution by the volume of water transpired during the period of culture. Plant growth characteristics and gas exchanges were also recorded. Results IPTSCF values were much greater than 1 (IPTSCF(Ni) = 5. 2 +/- 0. 9 and IPTSCF(Cd) = 4. 4 +/- 0. 6) whatever the amount of available Ni and Cd. This characterized a predominantly active plant metal uptake. Moreover, biological regulation was reported: plant growth and transpiration were significantly lower for hyperaccumulator plants cultivated in sand which was rich in available Ni and Cd, than for hyperaccumulator plants cultivated in topsoil, poor in available Ni and Cd. In the soil rhizosphere, capillary flow was related to transpiration and a depletion pattern was developed for Ni and sometimes for Cd. Conclusions Overall, the Intact Plant <b>Transpiration</b> Stream Concentration <b>Factor</b> appeared to be a relevant metal bioconcentration factor taking into account the predominant type of metal transport from roots to leaves, plant growth and transpiration coupling and metal availability.

Water use {{and response to}} two irrigation management practices by olive trees was monitored with sap flow compensation heat pulse sensors, ‘Watermark’ granular matrix block sensors and a capacitance probe. The 80 -plus-year-old mature olive tree orchard planted on a 12 m by 12 m spacing layout was converted in 2005 from dry-farming to drip irrigation and subjected to two water treatments: trees irrigated daily to supply for crop water demand and trees irrigated before-flowering, during pit-hardening and before crop-harvesting. Sap flow sensors were implanted in sample trees at three different positions around the trunk and measurements were taken at 30 min intervals during 4 months, from April to mid-August of 2005. Tree transpiration rates were estimated as average of sap flow rates. When trees were fully irrigated, the observed differences in daily sap flow rate amplitude were explained by the natural trees difference in canopy cover, plant height and conductance of water vapour sites. However, when deficit irrigation was prescribed and, when the trees stopped being irrigated, they gradually lost their ability to adequately respond to the evaporative demands of the day, showing smaller variations in amplitudes sap flow. After irrigation ceased in May 15, transpiration rate gradually decreased from its maximum of 7 l h− 1, when trees were fully irrigated and soil water content was near to field capacity, to values of less than 3 l h− 1 by July 3 as the soil water content gradually acted as the <b>transpiration</b> limiting <b>factor.</b> <b>Transpiration</b> rates recovered after irrigation was re-introduced on July 4. Although low in the non-irrigation period, transpiration rates never dropped to zero and stayed between 37 and 50 l d− 1 from May 27 to June 9, as trees were able to extract soil water {{in the absence of}} irrigation. Olive trees maintained transpiration to levels as high as 50 l d− 1 suggesting that long after irrigation is suppressed, a considerable amount of water held in the soil is made available to the trees. Differences in evapotranspiration and transpiration rates during the same period also indicated that olive trees, making use of the extensive root system developed in the 12 m by 12 m tree spacing, were able to extract soil water and maintain transpiration levels as high as 50 l d− 1, while soil water balance indicated tree evapotranspiration rates close to zero. This particular ability of dry-farmed olive trees to remove water held in the soil under adverse conditions of very low soil moisture and uncertainties associated with the real volume of soil effectively explored by the root system, make profile probe sensors, regardless of their accuracy, unsuitable for control of water uptake and management of dry-farmed olive orchards recently converted to irrigation. Likewise, watermark sensors, able to capture the variations of high soil water, failed to provide meaningfully values below 0. 28 cm 3 cm− 1.

Although the TSCF show that longer-chain PFCAs (e. g., perfluorododecanoic acid) get better transferred from the nutrient solution to the foliage than shorter-chain PFCAs (e. g., perfluoroheptanoic acid), the major fraction of longer-chain PFCAs is found in roots due to additional adsorption from the spiked solution.

The time required to achieve the steady state efflux concentration in the xylem sap correlated with log Kow values in a manner {{very similar to the}} root binding profile reported previously by GG Briggs et al. ([1982] Pestic Sci 13 : 495 - 504). After reaching the steady state efflux, the concentration ratio of each compound in the xylem sap to the final concentration in the {{pressure chamber}} was taken as the <b>transpiration</b> stream concentration <b>factor</b> (TSCF). A nonlinear relationship was observed between TSCF and log Kow values. The highest TSCF value was between 0. 6 to 0. 8 for compounds with log Kow between 2. 5 to 3. 5. The range of optimal log Kow values was slightly higher than that reported earlier by Briggs et al. ([1982] Pestic Sci 13 : 495 - 504). After taking into account the binding of the compound to soil, the apparent optimal Kow value for best root-to-shoot translocation is lowered to around 1. The relationship of root-to-shoot and phloem translocation was also discussed to promote a better understanding at the whole plant level of the uptake and translocation of a soil-applied xenobiotic...|$|R
40|$|The Greenhouse Emission Model has {{recently}} been adopted as a model package for assessing emissions to and concentrations in groundwater and surface water after use of plant protection products in greenhouse crops. Stakeholders advised that the model be tested against experimental data. In October 2014, facilities of WUR Plant Research were used to perform a pilot experiment in which cucumber plants on stone wool substrate were treated with three plant protection products, using a drip irrigation method. Concentrations of the active substances were measured in both the water flowing to and draining from the substrate. GEM was tailored to the experimental conditions and used to predict concentrations {{in parts of the}} experimental system. Measured and simulated concentrations of imidacloprid and fluopyram were comparable from approximately 36 hours after the start of the experiment onwards. Prior to this, concentrations in the inflowing water were underestimated and concentrations in the drain water were overestimated, probably because of incomplete mixing. For dimethomorph, agreement between the measured and calculated concentrations was reached after approximately 80 hours. This more lengthy period may be due to exceeding the solubility of the substance, causing precipitation or settling on the tube walls, and redissolving later on; the model does not account for these processes. Degradation of all three substances was found to be negligible over the duration of the experiment. Plant uptake was the major dissipation process. Experimental results show that uptake of substances was lower than uptake of water, thereby supporting the transpiration stream concentration approach proposed by Briggs et al. (1982); this approach is often applied however experimental evidence is scarce. <b>Transpiration</b> stream concentration <b>factors</b> far below one were found to fit experimental results best...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – • In {{this study}} of a 19 -year-old Acacia mangium {{plantation}} with a basal area of 26. 6 m 2 ha− 1 in subtropical South China, whole tree sap flow was measured continuously {{over a two-year period}} and the dependence of stand sap flow (Et) on environmental factors was investigated at diurnal (hourly), daily, seasonal and annual scales. • Daytime hourly mean Et was linearly correlated to photosynthetically active radiation (Q) and vapor pressure deficit (D) in each season during the whole study period (R 2 > 0. 57, P < 0. 001), whereas daily daytime mean Et was less tightly coupled to Q and D (R 2 < 0. 50). • Pronounced hysteresis was observed between Et and Q as well as D and the extent of the hysteresis varied seasonally. • Total annual stand transpiration was higher in the first year (244. 5 mm) than in the second year (185. 8 mm) although rainfall was lower in the first year (1 122. 4 mm) than in the second year (1 342. 5 mm), from which it can be concluded that annual stand transpiration did not simply increase with increased annual rainfall.

40|$|Problems with calcium (Ca) {{nutrition}} {{are often}} first noticed as disorders within rapidly developing, low-transpiring plant organs. More severe Ca deficiencies will be noticed in other plant organs and growth parameters as well. In {{order to prevent}} these disorders, such as blossom-end-rot (BER) in tomatoes, peppers and melons, tip-burn in lettuce, bitter pit in apples, internal browning (IB) in pineapples, twins in pineapples, internal brown fleck in potatoes and many other Ca-related disorders, {{it is important to}} understand the functions as well as all the conditions that may affect the uptake and translocation of Ca within the plant. Since Ca is needed to strengthen cell walls and to maintain membrane integrity, Ca deficiencies lead to the collapse of cells, resulting in tissue enzymatic browning, caused by polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes, as well as tissue susceptibility to secondary infections, such as Phytophthora spp., Erwinia spp. and Botrytis spp. Leaky membranes may also lead to chlorophyll losses or water-soaked areas. Since Ca ions are passively taken up by the roots with water and transported in the xylem with the <b>transpiration</b> stream, any <b>factor</b> affecting the uptake of water, such as climatic conditions, root functioning, salinity and so on, will affect the uptake of Ca. Several conditions may enhance the development of Ca-related disorders and may be grouped as: insufficient Ca uptake by the plant due to inadequate root-zone moisture, low available soil Ca and cation imbalances in the soil or fertigation solution, poor root growth and saline root zones; inadequate Ca distribution to low transpiring, rapidly developing plant organs due to poor xylem development, high transpiration rates in leaf canopies and low night-time root pressures; intraplant factors such as strong carbohydrate sinks, high growth rates and auxin and enzyme activities; and cultivar differences. Some practical aspects of Ca nutrition, with special reference to pineapple, are also discussed. Conference Pape...|$|R
40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is a {{high volume}} {{production}} chemical and {{the most commonly used}} gasoline oxygenate. Uptake, metabolism and toxicity of MTBE in trees were investigated in this study. Pre-rooted weeping willows (Salix babylonica L.) were exposed to hydroponic solution spiked with MTBE and incubated at 25. 0 ± 1 °C for 168 h. The normalized relative transpiration (NRT) rate of weeping willows was used to determine toxicity. MTBE and possible intermediate tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in solution, tissues of aerial parts of plants, and air were analyzed. Results from the toxicity test showed that severe signs of toxicity (the reduction of the NRT ≥ 35 %) were only found at the treatment group with high doses of MTBE 400 mg L- 1. Neither chlorosis of leaves nor large reduction in the NRT was observed at MTBE exposure to weeping willows ≤ 200 mg L- 1. Almost all applied MTBE was removed from the hydroponic solution by plants in all treatment groups. Small amounts of MTBE were detected in the plant tissues, but a large fraction of the applied MTBE was found in the air through plant transpiration. Mass balance studies showed that MTBE was assimilated into the plants from hydroponic solution but was not metabolized during transport in the plant. Phytovolatilization was the only relevant removal process for MTBE. <b>Transpiration</b> stream concentration <b>factor</b> (TSCF), an important parameter for design of engineered MTBE phytoremediation systems, was estimated to be 1. 12. In conclusion, although this compound is persistent to the attack by plant enzymes, atmospheric MTBE is much more susceptible to photo-oxidation for decomposition. Phytoremediation of MTBE polluted soils and groundwater is an alternative to presently available remediation technologies. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the root}} uptake of {{xenobiotic}} organic chemicals into plants {{is critical for}} assessing the human and ecological health risks associated with the consumption of plants growing in contaminated environments. Root uptake of xenobiotic organics occurs passively in conjunction with transpiration and the transport from root to shoot is ultimately controlled by passage through one or more lipid root membranes. The <b>transpiration</b> stream concentration <b>factor</b> (TSCF), the ratio between the concentration of a chemical in the xylem {{to that in the}} solution used by the roots, is used to describe the relative ability of an organic chemical to be passively transported from root to shoot. However, relatively few experimental TSCF values exist due to the cost and the lack of regulatory requirements for generating such data. Where literature data exist for chemicals having more than one TSCF, the variability is often large {{due to the lack of}} standardized methods and difficulty in accounting for metabolism and volatilization losses occurring during the uptake experiments. Because of the scarcity of experimental values, estimated TSCFs are often used. Widely cited estimation approaches relating TSCF and the logarithm octanol/water partition coefficient (log KOW) suggest that only compounds that are in the intermediate lipophilicity range (log KOW = 2) will be taken up and translocated by plants. However, recent data for highly water soluble compounds such as 1, 4 -dioxane, MTBE, and sulfolane suggest that these estimation techniques should be critically reviewed. To re-evaluate the relationship between TSCF and log Kow, TSCFs were measured for 25 organic chemicals ranging in log KOW from - 0. 8 to 5 using an improved pressure chamber technique. The technique provides an approach for efficiently generating consistent plant uptake data. By using this data, a new mass transfer model relating TSCF and log KOW was developed that indicates that neutral, polar organic compounds are most likely taken up by plant roots and translocated to shoot tissue. An extensive review of literature TSCF studies supports the updated model...|$|R
40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a carcinogenic, {{chlorinated}} {{volatile organic}} compound that was commonly used as a degreasing solvent for aircraft maintenance at many US Air Force bases. Past improper disposal of TCE has resulted in contaminated groundwater at many of these facilities. Phytoremediation, defined {{as the use of}} plants and their associated microorganisms to stabilize or remove contamination, has been implemented as part of a TCE groundwater cleanup at Travis Air Force base near Sacramento, CA and is being considered as a remediation option at other bases. Volatilization of TCE from leaves and the surface of the soil near the trees were shown {{to be the most important}} removal mechanisms at the Travis site. Past studies conducted on indigenous trees growing above TCE contaminated groundwater at several Hill Air Force Base (HAFB) locations have also shown that TCE is taken up and volatilized by the trees. However, phytoremediation has not been implemented, in part because of the difficulty in predicting the potential effectiveness of TCE removal over time. Flow through or recirculating chambers were used to quantify the amount of TCE removed by volatilization through leaf, trunk, and soil surfaces. Tenax™ sorbent tubes, used to collect TCE from the chambers, were analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Tree cores were collected using an incremental borer and analyzed by headspace GC/MS to quantify the TCE mass contained in the trees. Field measured transpiration stream concentrations (TSC) and groundwater data were used to calculate <b>transpiration</b> stream concentration <b>factors</b> (TSCF) for TCE. Comparing current and historical data, it was found that trees reach a steady state TSCF value of 0. 26 after about 15 years. Using this information, it was predicted that a phytoremediation plot containing 40 poplar trees located in a seep area within HAFB OU 2 would remove 4. 82 kg of TCE annually. A larger plot covering the entire hillside above this seep (160 trees) could remove up to 19. 28 kg of TCE annually, once trees reach a steady state TSCF...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{amounts of}} {{xenobiotic}} organic contaminants have been frequently {{identified in the}} environment, including surface water and wastewater streams, and some are even in drinking water. The concern of unintended ingestion by humans or wildlife of such compounds resulting from the uptake by plants has risen in recent years. Although the uptake {{of a variety of}} xenobiotic organic contaminants by plants has been reported and the contaminants are found in the fruits in some cases, the differences between plant species are not fully understood. The emphasis of this research is to investigate the unique uptake ability of zucchini that has been reported repeatedly in recent years. Xylem saps, collected using a pressure chamber technique, were used to determine the values of <b>Transpiration</b> Stream Concentration <b>Factor</b> (TSCF), the ratio of the contaminant concentration in the xylem to that in the solution. Soybean 2 ̆ 2 hoyt, 2 ̆ 2 squash 2 ̆ 2 zephyr, 2 ̆ 2 and zucchini 2 ̆ 2 gold rush 2 ̆ 2 were used to compare the uptake ability of each plant. The root tissue was analyzed for total carbon and lipid content. Xylem sap was analyzed for total organic carbon and protein contents. The solubilities of the compounds in the xylem sap and deionized water were also determined using a modified shake flask method. From the measurement of TSCF, the uptake of hydrophobic contaminants in zucchini 2 ̆ 2 gold rush 2 ̆ 2 was found to be three-to tenfold of the other two plant species. The lipid content of the root tissue from zucchini 2 ̆ 2 gold rush 2 ̆ 2 was twice as much of that in soybean and squash 2 ̆ 2 zephyr, 2 ̆ 2 indicating enhanced adsorption of the hydrophobic compounds. The solubility of triclocarban in the xylem sap of zucchini 2 ̆ 2 gold rush 2 ̆ 2 was also twice the amount of that in soybean xylem sap. The enhanced solubility could be a result of high protein content measured in zucchini 2 ̆ 2 gold rush 2 ̆ 2 xylem sap, which may be increasing the facilitated transport of the hydrophobic compounds. The data generated in this study will be used to better understand the mechanistic differences associated with the plant uptake of organic contaminants by different species. This information can also be used in the selection of the plant species used in risk assessment studies and phytoremediation studies...|$|R
