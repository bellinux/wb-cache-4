50|$|In {{combination}} {{with a series}} connection, T-segments are often produced as a phase compound {{in the form of}} a toothed chain. As is the case of single T-segments, the linear-winding technique as well as the flyer-winding technique are also applied in this context. When it comes to the winding of the teeth, the final wire of the first tooth is guided to the next tooth and then serves as the starting wire for the second tooth. This process continues, depending on the number of a phase's sub-segments. The design of the components does not show any substantial difference compared to the one of classic single teeth. The main reason for the processing of T-segments into one tooth chain lies in the reduced of number of contact points. Six contact points are required for three wound single tooth poles. However, only two contact points are needed if the just mentioned arrangement inside the winding machine is adopted. When using high current with low operating power, this type of manufacture is especially beneficial since it reduces contact resistances and potential errors. However, it is a very complex endeavor to form the tooth chains to a complete stator which is of disadvantage. It must be ensured, for example, that the end wires of each tooth are equipped with <b>tension</b> <b>relief</b> to ensure that the winding does not open during handling. Usually, it is taken care of with adhesive tape or pole or bag-type forming of the tooth's frontal insulation where the wire may be attached after the winding process. Single teeth are easy to handle, whereas tooth chains must be built in carefully, taking into account the risk of damaging the connecting wires.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{descriptive study}} of qualitative approach {{with the objective}} to identify the changes perceived by family members {{of children and adolescents}} in psychic suffering who participated in operational groups. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews conducted with eight family members and then submitted to thematic analysis, generating three categories: a) change in emotional expression, b) change in self-perception and c) learning techniques for dealing with psychic suffering. The results demonstrated that the groups provide an opportunity for <b>tension</b> <b>relief,</b> function as spaces for clarification and listening and sharing concerns, improve family interactions, stimulate self-care, and teach members how to use social interaction techniques. We conclude that the benefits perceived by family members participating in groups demonstrate the possibility of facilitating operational groups based on Pichon Rivière’s theory. To this effect, nursing professionals must receive qualified training in order to comprehend, apprehend and make use of this technology. doi: 10. 5216 /ree. v 16 i 3. 21777...|$|E

40|$|Non-therapeutic infant male {{circumcision}} {{is a permanent}} surgical alteration to the penis that may cause significant physical, sexual and psychological harm.

40|$|It {{is common}} sense to state that working without being mentally {{fatigued}} leads to increased labor productivity.

40|$|Objective: Although the {{relationship}} between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and impulsivity has long been debated, impulsivity has not been systematically examined in clinical samples of OCD. Meanwhile, recent findings suggest that impulsivity is multi-dimensional construct that can be examined through several constructs. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate multiple facets of impulsivity in OCD. Method: The recruitment includes 80 OCD and 76 healthy control participants. Participants completed a test battery comprising three behavioral tasks of stop signal task (SST), delay discounting task (DDT) and balloon analog risk test (BART), and one self-report measure of the Barratt Impulsiveness scale (BIS- 11). Results: OCD subjects showed significantly lower stop signal reaction time of SST reflecting higher action impulsivity and higher delay discounting parameter of DDT suggesting increased choice impulsivity but significantly lower adjusted mean pump of BART implying lower risk taking propensity of BART than healthy control. Conclusion: Increased Action and choice impulsivity, and decreased risk taking propensities were found in OCD.

40|$|At {{the core}} {{of child abuse and}} neglect is a family pattern in which the child's body, mind and {{emotions}} are available to be exploited by adults, either to gratify their needs or provide an outlet for their tensions (Miller, 1994). It should not surprise us, then, that children whose bodies have been used in this way might become adults who in turn use their bodies to relieve tension or act out impulses. Their experience is that a body is a vehicle for tension and has no other real value. To make matters worse, abused children are also deprived of the normal experiences of <b>tension</b> <b>relief.</b> When distressed, most children seek connections with others, preferably adults, to find soothing, reassurance, or comfort.

40|$|ObjectivesFinite element {{modeling}} {{was adopted}} to quantitatively compare, {{for the first}} time and on a patient-specific basis, the biomechanical effects of a broad spectrum of different neochordal implantation techniques for the repair of isolated posterior mitral leaflet prolapse. MethodsCardiac magnetic resonance images were acquired from 4 patients undergoing surgery. A patient-specific 3 -dimensional model of the mitral apparatus and the motion of the annulus and papillary muscles were reconstructed. The location and extent of the prolapsing region were confirmed by intraoperative findings, and the mechanical properties of the mitral leaflets, chordae tendineae and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene neochordae were included. Mitral systolic biomechanics was simulated under preoperative conditions and after 5 different neochordal procedures: single neochorda, double neochorda, standard neochordal loop with 3 neochordae of the same length and 2 premeasured loops with 1 common neochordal loop and 3 different branched neochordae arising from it, alternatively one third and two thirds of the entire length. ResultsThe best repair in terms of biomechanics was achieved with a specific neochordal technique in the single patient, according to the location of the prolapsing region. However, all techniques achieved a slight reduction in papillary muscle forces and <b>tension</b> <b>relief</b> in intact native chordae proximal to the prolapsing region. Multiple neochordae implantation improved the repositioning of the prolapsing region below the annular plane and better redistributed mechanical stresses on the leaflet. ConclusionsAlthough applied on a small cohort of patients, systematic biomechanical differences were noticed between neochordal techniques, potentially affecting their short- to long-term clinical outcomes. This study opens the way to patient-specific optimization of neochordal techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: Koob's allostatic {{model of}} {{addiction}} emphasizes {{the transition from}} positive reinforcement to negative reinforcement as dependence develops. This study seeks to extend this well-established neurobiological model to humans by examining subjective response to alcohol (SR) as a biobehavioral marker of alcohol reinforcement. Specifically, this study examines (a) differential SR in heavy drinkers (HDs) vs. alcohol dependent individuals (ADs) and (b) whether HDs and ADs differ {{in terms of the}} association between SR and craving. Methods: Data was culled from two alcohol challenge studies, totalling 91 participants (oversampled on OPRM 1 Asp 40 carriers). Alcohol was administered intravenously and participants completed standard measures of SR and craving at BrAC's of 0. 02, 0. 04, and 0. 06 g/dl. SR was modeled as a multi-dimensional construct consisting of stimulation, sedation, and <b>tension</b> <b>relief.</b> Results: ADs reported significantly higher sedation and craving initially and exhibited a blunted response to alcohol along escalating BrACs. ADs exhibited greater initial tension but did not differ from HDs in tension reduction across rising BrACs. Further, alcohol-induced stimulation was associated with alcohol craving to a significantly greater degree in HDs, as compared to ADs. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that HDs and ADs differ in their subjective experience of alcohol and in the association between dimensions of SR and craving for alcohol. Hypotheses derived from the allostatic model were partially supported, such that, while ADs and HDs did not differ on stimulation response, there was a relative dissociation between positive reinforcement and craving in ADs as compared to HDs. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{conventional}} knowledge {{for as long}} as ships have existed that the catenary effect of an anchor line augments the efficiency of an anchoring system. This is achieved by making the anchor line as heavy as possible thus lowering the effective angle of pull on the anchor. This notion has, however, come under criticism in recent times. Many small boat owners have shifted to lighter tauter lines for anchoring. The argument in favor of this new method is the cost savings associated with lighter anchoring and the <b>tension</b> <b>relief</b> that comes with using lighter and more elastic anchor lines. The {{purpose of this study is}} to therefore compare the performance of long slack lines that form catenary shapes with that of shorter taut lines. An analysis is presented that describes the surge motion of a small anchored boat exposed to an input forcing function and various retarding forces and effects. The anchoring system used in the analytical model results in a non-linear but symmetrical restoring force, which resists the force-induced motion of the boat. Two main types of anchor lines are considered: uniform-material and two-material anchor lines. Each anchor line is evaluated both in catenary configuration and taut configuration in terms of its ability to minimize the motions of the boat and tension force in the anchor line due to wind disturbances. by Jessy Mbagara Mwarage.

40|$|Cable yarding {{systems are}} a common method for {{transporting}} materials in mountainous terrain where environmental, safety or economic considerations do not permit ground-based methods such as skidding, forwarding or shovel-logging. Although effective in steep terrain, cable yarding requires anchored support for skyline and operating line operation. Furthermore, mechanized steep slope harvesting, which often uses cable assistance, also necessitates sufficient anchoring for large cable loads. These systems rely on a fixed anchor, or tailhold, to provide adequate line restraint for operation. Anchored guylines and skylines usually depend on available stumps or trees (Peters and Biller 1985). Where these are not available, mobile anchors such as bulldozers or excavators can be used. Mobile equipment anchors have an advantage of predictable resisting capacity, as opposed to trees and stumps, and may present a means of relieving excessive cable tensions in skyline systems without a catastrophic failure. We present a design approach for skyline <b>tension</b> <b>relief</b> with a comparison to actual field data. The analysis demonstrates that exceedance of a mobile anchor sliding resistance results in movement, limiting maximum skyline tensions and subsequently reducing them after the anchor shifts forward. Other anchor types, like stumps, anchored deadmen and engineered anchors, {{do not have the}} tendency for gradual movement to relieve skyline tensions as failure is often catastrophic, resulting in higher and potentially dangerous cable tensions, and complete loss of cable tension at failure. For mobile anchors, a relationship between cable tension and length presents an efficient means of predicting the anchor movement to facilitate design of appropriate equipment setback. A comparison of an analytical approach based on cable tensions, cable lengths, and anchor capacity with instrumented field tests demonstrates that the use of equipment, as a primary or auxiliary anchoring system, can be effective and potentially safer when adhering to design constraints based on equipment, equipment placement and in-situ soil properties...|$|E
40|$|It {{is against}} the social and {{cultural}} backdrop of South Africa that I investigate gender performativity in South African films with reference to Leon Schuster’s comedies; There’s a Zulu on my Stoep (1993), Mr Bones (2001); Mama Jack (2005) and Mad Buddies (2012). Leon Schuster is responsible for the most commercially successfully films produced in Africa. The significance of this research lends itself to the notion that the trends and tendencies of contemporary culture are defined by what is represented and learnt through constructed representations in mainstream media such as film. For the purpose of this study, gender representation and comedy within the framework of South African film are the main foci. There appears to be very little written on comedy and gender, specifically in a South African context. Judith Butler’s performativity theory forms the methodological foundation of analysis of the representation of gender in Schuster’s films. In addition, visual textual and constant comparison analysis are used as part of the methodological framework of this study. Due to the lack of literature on South African film comedy, the general understanding of comedy refers to the film genre as being a catalyst for transformation. It is also suggested that social control is reinforced and therefore, upholds societal and cultural ideologies in comedy. Satire is also found to postulate a preferred comedic mechanism to criticise ideologies in countries with repressive regimes. South African comedy is also understood to contribute towards <b>tension</b> <b>relief</b> in such countries through the means of facilitating laughter. In a general framework, as well as Schuster’s film comedies, gender representation and therefore that of gender performativity is found to conform to stereotypical conventions of males and females which ultimately maintains the ideals of the creators and the contextual ideologies they stand to represent and serve. By making representations of gender and that of gender performativity laughable, Schuster’s comedies can be said to raise awareness of the gender differences and inequalities in representations. The stereotypes which ultimately highlight gender inequality in the films, follows that of cultural, social and traditional norms.

5000|$|His symphonies, {{especially}} {{the last six}} of his seven, are atonal but also extremely contrapuntal, involving many musical lines combining simultaneously. In this he resembles Charles Ives in some ways. In his compositional work Vermeulen always focused his attention on melody. In his music a flow of melodies can be heard from beginning to end, quite diverse in form and character. The majority of the material is asymmetrical, {{based on the principle}} of 'free declamation', that is to say: the melodic curve and length of two consecutive sentences usually vary. Frequently Vermeulen spins long melismas into ever continuous melodies, in which every memory of period structure is absent. Particularly striking is the free rhythm of flowing lines, which have become disengaged from a fixed classification of metre by antimetric figures and ties. Yet elsewhere we come across short and pithy melodies, with a clear pulsation. A characteristic feature of his music is the sophisticated climactic activity and the alternation of <b>tension</b> and <b>relief,</b> mostly supported by harmony.In his writings Vermeulen draws a parallel between melody and the individual: [...] "The melody is a frame of mind expressed in tones." [...] Seen in the light of Vermeulen's line of reasoning, a multi-voiced, polymelodic composition takes on the meaning of an aural representation of society. By combining several individual melodies, he reveals the wish he cherishes for society, namely that of every individual being able to freely express and develop himself, without infringing upon other people's freedom to develop their abilities. Although Vermeulen's writings on music give the impression that he was completely consistent in applying his polymelodic concept from the beginning until the end of a piece, most of his compositions contain several passages with only one or two voices, embedded in marvellous harmonies. Open, simple textures alternate with very complex ones, as does quasi-tonality with atonal constellations.Early on, a spirit of freedom and urge for innovation prompted Vermeulen to abandon tonality and reject the traditional form schemes. In the First Cello Sonata free atonality breaks through in spurts, which from his Second Symphony onwards determines melody and harmony in his oeuvre. As opposed to Arnold Schoenberg, Vermeulen did not choose to build a new regulatory system, but proceeded purely in terms of thematic information and its logical and psychological development. His symphonies and chamber works consequently differ greatly as far as construction is concerned. But he always succeeded in creating architectonic cohesion. The Third Symphony is in a large A-B-A form, in which A develops linearly and B is reminiscent of a Classical rondo. The Fourth Symphony is built on six themes, three of which return just before the end; the long epilogue is counterbalanced by the hammering prologue, both on the pedal tone C. The large-scale Violin Sonata is based on the major seventh, omnipresent both in melody and harmony.Vermeulen's compositions share a unique combination of energy, power, lyricism, and tenderness. The vitality of his works {{is the result of the}} aim he had in mind: to compose as an ode to the beauty of the earth and in astonishment about life, creating music which appeals to the spirituality of man, bestowing feelings of happiness on him and making him acquainted with the source of life, the Creative Spirit. These ambitions, put into words in the book titled Princiepen der Europese muziek (Principles of European music) and numerous articles, were at right angles to the mainstream movements. Consequently, Vermeulen did not have followers or disciples.Apart from the aesthetic-ethical 'message', which is also the subject of most of his songs, Vermeulen's symphonies and chamber music offer an ingenious interplay of melodies, a colorful (orchestral) sound with many felicitous instrumental ideas, fascinating sound fields, innovating parallel harmony and a captivating canon technique.Vermeulen's work has been quoted as seminal by influential Dutch composers such as Louis Andriessen, but his direct influence is much more difficult to trace - his style, after all, is eclectic and highly personal. Moreover, his actual collaboration with other composers remained very limited. Almost all of his recognition took place well after his death.|$|R

My dissertation, Freedom Under the Law, investigates {{the conception of}} rationality that underlies the divorce of tradition and reason {{in the writings of}} the English Civil Wars and Interregnum (1642 - 1660). In this period, republican authors strive to turn English subjects into citizens whose active virtue and rational judgment is unclouded by tradition and habits. This dissertation argues that these writers build their arguments on a paradoxical depiction of the people as both rationally capable of consenting to political association and irrationally bound by custom. In conversation with Alasdair MacIntyre's analysis of the Aristotelian tradition, Freedom Under the Law exposes the tensions that arise in the writings of both canonical and non-canonical seventeenth-century authors as they attempt to re-imagine and represent the individual, the family, and the commonwealth. As this project demonstrates, writers ranging from John Milton to the millenarian John Rogers to the Parliamentarian Henry Parker reveal a residual understanding of political and social community that owes its vocabulary to medieval and classical modes of thinking. However, while Aristotelian models of political association closely link reason, habit, and justice, the authors considered in my project present an understanding of individuals as capable of rational action independent of tradition and custom. This dissertation traces how this revolutionary account of the individual in political association is expressed through a range of often-conflicting formulations of the English nation. Freedom Under the Law begins with Milton's representation of education in the virtues in his early theatrical piece, Comus (1634). This first chapter establishes the guiding question of the project: how is the relationship between individual and community reconfigured in the literature of the seventeenth-century? In chapters two and three, I situate Milton's domestic and political prose of 1643 - 49 in the context of Puritan marriage manuals and Parliamentarian and royalist tracts. Through these comparisons, I show that Milton's distrust of customary laws produces a representation of the virtuous individual and the ideal nation as independent of their own history and, ironically, driven to constant iconoclastic self-reformation. Chapter four demonstrates how impoverished accounts of natural law lead to a devaluing of the people's legislative authority in Edward Sexby's call for the killing of Oliver Cromwell in Killing No Murder (1657), apologias of the Cromwellian dissolution of the Parliament in 1653, and the Putney Debates in 1647. Chapter five considers Milton's Readie and Easie Way (1660) alongside Fifth Monarchist pamphlets. This chapter questions J. G. A. Pocock's distinction between a medieval custom-based juristic tradition and a republican understanding of rational political life, a distinction adopted widely in Milton studies. I argue that comparison with Aquinas's Aristotelian account of custom and law brings into <b>relief</b> <b>tensions</b> in Milton's model of rational political participation. Throughout the dissertation, I argue that the conception of virtue and reason adopted by Milton and his contemporaries allows them to dismiss historically-bound embodiments of justice and reason as enslaving accretions.
