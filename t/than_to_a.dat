5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} sejm of 1632 eventually {{concluded in}} the election of Władysław; he had no serious other contenders. The decision on {{who would be the}} Commonwealth's next king was reached on 8 November, but as the pacta conventa were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the pacta conventa, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; {{to find a way to}} fund a naval fleet; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the Sejm's approval; not to take a wife without the Senate's approval; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the Royal Mint to the Royal Treasury rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> private treasury. When the election result had been announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the nobility (szlachta), who had taken part {{in the election}}, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.|$|E

5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

25|$|In antiquity, field {{signs or}} {{standards}} {{were used in}} warfare that can be categorized as vexilloid or 'flag-like'.

25|$|Early {{identification}} and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, {{and for some}} conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that people turn to the Internet rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.|$|E

Specifically, when induced to think about {{and focus on the}} future, Chinese valued the future more than the past, just like Euro-Canadians; when induced to think about and focus on the past, Euro-Canadians valued the past more than the future, just like Chinese...|$|R
25|$|One story often told, both {{in respect}} of a full size {{carriage}} {{and one of his}} models, is that one night Murdoch decided to test his carriage outside on the open road and it soon outpaced him, leaving him to chase after it. Whilst chasing it he encountered a local clergyman in a state of considerable distress who had mistaken his carriage, with its billowing smoke and fire burning under the boiler, for the devil. This story may be accurate; however, is more likely to relate to a model <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full-size steam carriage.|$|E
25|$|The Parachute Regiment {{were not}} issued any special weapons. Their small arms {{were the same}} {{as the rest of the}} army's: the bolt action Lee–Enfield rifle and the Enfield or Webley {{revolver}} or the M1911 pistol. For a submachine gun, they used the British Sten in Northwest Europe, which was issued in higher numbers <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> normal infantry battalion. Paratroopers attached to Eighth Army used the Thompson submachine gun in the North African and Mediterranean theatre and during Operation Dragoon. Each section had a Bren light machine gun and the platoon had a 2-inch mortar. The only battalion heavy weapons were eight 3-inch mortars, four Vickers machine guns and after 1943, ten PIAT anti tank weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} process takes considerable time and planning since it involves multiple steps, with choices {{to be made}} and deadlines to be met. Students file separate applications to each school, although the Common Application expedites the process in many instances. Most undergraduate institutions admit students to the entire college and not to a particular department or major, unlike many European universities and American graduate schools, although some undergraduate programs such as architecture or engineering may require a separate application at some universities. As a general rule, applying to two-year county and community colleges is much easier <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-year school, often requiring only a high school transcript or minimum test score.|$|E

25|$|Francione {{has also}} criticized PETA for having caused {{grassroots}} animal rights groups to close, groups that he argues were {{essential for the}} survival of the animal rights movement, which rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione writes that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations too. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local group. Some members of the animal-rights movement have responded that Francione's position with respect to groups engaged in actual fieldwork is unnecessarily divisive and hurts animal advocacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Proteus {{is close to}} a sphere with a radius of about 210km, {{although}} deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to 20km; scientists believe it is about {{as large as a}} body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.|$|E
