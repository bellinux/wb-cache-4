Its AC induction motors and side-rod drive powered six axles.

25|$|In 1932, Allis-Chalmers {{collaborated with}} Firestone to {{introduce}} pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and fuel {{economy in the}} range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E

25|$|Tractive {{effort is}} a measure of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, tractive effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used dynamometer cars to measure <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> at speed in actual road testing.|$|E
25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in <b>tractive</b> <b>force.</b> Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} consisted of equalising beams with coil springs; the equalising beams were {{located within the}} bogie 'sandwich type' side frame, whilst the secondary suspension utilised a two bolsters per bogie incorporating four transverse leaf springs. The locomotive weight was carried on four sliding elements on the bolster, with a center pivot used to transfer <b>tractive</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model is developed to simulate bed-load transport using Distinct Element Method (DEM). The model describes the bed-load transport as dynamically interdependent motions of individual sediment particles under the flow action. A steady logarithmic velocity distribution over the flow depth {{is considered to}} represent fluid motion, while turbulent intensities are also included within the closure model. The present model accounts for both fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions, which are the predominant micro-mechanisms of bed-load transport under low and high <b>tractive</b> <b>forces,</b> respectively. Characteristic features of bed-load transport, previously reported by experimental observations, are numerically reproduced. The concept of vertical momentum transfer is exploited to describe features of concurrently present of saltation and sheet-flow layers. It is concluded that the vertical motion of particles is not significantly active in sheet-flow layer and the particle momentum is preserved. Consequently the interparticle collisions is the predominant mechanism of bed-load transport at high fluid <b>tractive</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, {{trains are}} pulled using a locomotive. This {{involves}} {{one or more}} powered vehicles being located {{at the front of}} the train, providing sufficient <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A push-pull train has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A railroad car is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.|$|E
500|$|Development of the General Electric (GE) {{steam turbine}} {{locomotives}} began in late 1936, when GE and the Union Pacific (UP) began collaborating on an oil-powered steam turbine-electric design that they termed a [...] "steam-electric locomotive".

Early GE specifications detailed a streamlined shape, 2+C-C+2 wheel arrangement, and production of [...] and [...] of starting tractive effort (the force generated by a locomotive's prime mover in order to generate motion through <b>tractive</b> <b>force).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The O1 {{class was}} a light {{passenger}} type. Eight of these engines were built from June 1930 to December 1931. The P5 class was also introduced, with two of this class being placed in service during July and August 1931. Following these came the P5A, a slightly heavier design capable of traveling [...] and with a <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of 56,250 pounds. In all, 89 of these locomotives were built. The first had a box cab design and were placed in service in 1932. The following year, the last 28 under construction were redesigned to have a streamlined type of cab. Some engines underwent regearing for freight service.|$|E
50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. <b>Tractive</b> <b>forces</b> from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the bogie pivot centre. Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} body {{consisted of}} single bridging slab. On this slab the body parts were fixed with screws. The bridging slab {{laid on the}} bogies using pivot bearings. To prevent the transmission of <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> over the body the bearings had longitudinal play. Beside these two spring-loaded bearings were mounted.

2500|$|Whyte {{classification}} is indirectly {{connected to}} locomotive performance. Given adequate {{proportions of the}} rest of the locomotive, power output is determined by the size of the fire, and for a bituminous coal-fuelled locomotive, this is determined by the grate area. Modern non-compound locomotives are typically able to produce about 40 drawbar horsepower per square foot of grate. <b>Tractive</b> <b>force,</b> as noted earlier, is largely determined by the boiler pressure, the cylinder proportions and the size of the driving wheels. However, it is also limited by the weight on the driving wheels (termed [...] "adhesive weight"), which needs to be at least four times the tractive effort.|$|E
2500|$|Placing the {{throttle}} {{into the first}} power position will cause the traction motors {{to be connected to}} the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running [...] "light" [...] (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance {{the throttle}} as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with Wheel slide protection to counter slippery rail conditions. [...] Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. [...] This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|E
50|$|Although {{designed}} for 84 ton locos, 94 ton X Class were built for opening the line. Strengthening of all NIMT bridges from 1925 to 1932 allowed axle loads up to 14 tons and 135 ton K and 145 ton Ka classes.

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background It is generally assumed that safety of tissue manipulations during (laparoscopic) surgery {{is related to}} the magnitude of force that is exerted on the tissue. To provide trainees with performance feedback about tissuehandling skills, it is essential to define objective criteria for judging the safety of applied forces. To be of clinical relevance, these criteria should relate the applied forces to the risk of tissue damage. This experimental study was conducted to determine which <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> during suturing cause tissue damage in different types of porcine tissues. Methods <b>Tractive</b> <b>forces</b> were applied on eight different tissue types (fascia, aorta, vena cava, peritoneum, small and large bowel, uterus, and fallopian tube) of 10 different pigs by placing increasingly higher loads on sutures in the tissue. We determined the load at what tissue damage occurred through visual inspection of the tissue. For each tissue sample, three consecutive measurements were performed. Results The average maximum acceptable force varied between 11. 43 N for fascia to 1. 25 N for fallopian tube. The difference in allowable force between these two structures is almost tenfold.

2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. [...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E
