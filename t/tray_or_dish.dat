40|$|Affinity {{surfaces}} {{were produced}} by coupling human immunoglobulin (HGG) {{to the surface}} of tissue culture grade plastic-ware with a water-soluble carbodiimide followed by treatment with anti-HGG antisera. Surface immunoglobulin SIg) bearing human B lymphocytes attach to these surfaces when centrifuged on to them and unattached cells could be recovered by inverting the <b>trays</b> <b>or</b> <b>dishes.</b> Optimal cell attachment conditions could be rapidly evaluated by counting cells attached to representative areas of multi-well trays and percentage of SIg-bearing cells quantified. Evidence was obtained for cell attachment through Fc receptors as well as SIg using unrelated antigen [...] antibody-coated trays. This could be prevented by using the F (ab') 2 fragments of the antisera. Under these conditions specific attachment through K and lambda light chains could be achieved with normal and chronic lymphocytic leukaemic lymphocytes. Using tissue culture plastic Petri dishes and relatively small quantities of antiserum, larger numbers of lymphocytes could be processed to produce T lymphocytes containing less than 1 per cent of contaminating SIg-positive cells...|$|R

50|$|Per Thomas Keller's recipe, a pipérade {{is made of}} peeled, finely chopped, {{and reduced}} peppers, yellow onions, tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The piperade is spread thinly in a baking <b>tray</b> <b>or</b> {{casserole}} <b>dish,</b> then layered on top with evenly sized, thinly sliced rounds of zucchini, yellow squash, Japanese eggplant, and roma tomatoes, covered in parchment paper, then baked slowly for several hours to steam the vegetables. The parchment is removed so that the vegetables may then roast, acquiring additional flavor through caramelization. To serve, the piperade is formed into a small mound, and the rounds arranged in a fanned-out pattern to cover the piperade base. A balsamic vinaigrette is drizzled on the plate, which may be garnished.|$|R
