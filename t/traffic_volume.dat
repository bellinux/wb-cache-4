5|$|Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 300 and 3,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly between Washtucna and Ritzville.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the portion}} of NY322 between NY83 and the county line handled an {{estimated}} average of 1,810 vehicles per day. The <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increases to 2,300 per day from there to Main Street {{in the village of}} South Dayton. East of Main Street, <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> falls to 1,280 cars per day.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste, operator of the motorway, and results are published by Hrvatske ceste. The largest annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT) volume is often recorded in the Sveta HelenaKomin section, although all sections between Sveta Helena and Varaždin display similar AADT. AADT data for sections north of Varaždin show considerable drops in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> As the motorway <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> is measured through analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Ivanja RekaSveta Helena, {{is not included in}} the report. However, since the section {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, it carries significantly heavier traffic than any other sections of the A4 motorwayin 2004, <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> along the toll-free section of the A4 motorway was approximately 24,000vehicles per day (AADT) between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Sveta Helena interchanges and nearly 41,000vehicles per day between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Ivanja Reka interchanges. <b>Traffic</b> <b>volume</b> measured on the Ivanja RekaIvanić Grad section of the A3 motorway increased by 30%, hinting at a similar increase in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> on the A4 route south of Sveta Helena.|$|E

30|$|Snowfall is an {{important}} factor affecting variations of <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> in winter season. In the research conducted by Roh et al. [24, 25], it is indicated through regression modeling techniques that <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> for both passenger cars and truck decrease with an increase in the amount of snowfall on the ground for regional long-distance-type road facilities. However, interestingly, it is also indicated that truck <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> on the commuter-type road are not greatly affected as much as those of long-distance-type road. The current research confirms the results in the previous studies [24, 25] on the variations of truck <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> in winter season on the commuter road.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{arterial}} corridors are landscapes {{that give}} rise to short and long-term exposures to transportation-related pollution. With high <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> and a wide mix of road users, urban arterial environments are important targets for improved exposure assessment to traffic-related pollution. A common method to estimate exposure is to use <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> as a proxy. The study presented here analyzes a unique yearlong dataset of simultaneous roadside air quality and traffic observations for a U. S. arterial to assess the reliability of using <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> as a proxy for traffic-related exposure. Results show how the relationships of <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> with NO and NO 2 vary not only by time of day and season but also by time aggregation. At short-term aggregations (15 minutes) nitrogen oxides were found to have a significant linear relationship with <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> during morning hours for all seasons although variability was still high (r 2 = 0. 1 - 0. 45 NO, r 2 = 0. 14 - 0. 27 NO 2), and little to no relationship during evening periods (r 222). Comparisons with coarse annual results validate the use of <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> to estimate annual exposure concentrations for morning periods (r 2 = 0. 89 NO, r 2 = 0. 87 NO 2) and evening NO 2 (r 2 = 0. 46). <b>Traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> are a weak or poor predictor for annual evening NO (r 2 = - 0. 09) and short-term 15 minute aggregations. Seasonal and diurnal characterizations show that roadside PM 2. 5 (mass) measurements do not have a relationship with local <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes,</b> leading us to conclude that PM 2. 5 mass is more tied to regional sources and meteorological conditions. As epidemiology and personal exposure assessment research aims to study health impacts and pollutant levels encountered by pedestrians, bicyclists, those waiting for transit, and other road users, these results show when <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> alone can be a reliable proxy for exposure and when this approach is not warranted...|$|R
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} traffic census at toll stations and reported by Autocesta Rijeka–Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste—the operators of the northern and the southern portions of the motorway respectively. The reported <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered between Jastrebarsko and Lučko interchanges – with 31,432 vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT), and 53,216 vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo2 interchange the first major drop of <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to traffic transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> are registered near Zadar (served by Zadar1 and Zadar2 interchanges) and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries significant tourist traffic. The seasonal increase <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Lučko–Jastrebarsko section to 160% as measured on Sveti Rok–Maslenica section. The summer season <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increase on the motorway is 120%.|$|E

40|$|In a {{communication}} network, point-to-point <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> {{over time are}} critical for designing protocols that route information efficiently and for maintaining security, whether at the scale of an internet service provider or within a corporation. While technically feasible, the direct measurement of point-to-point traffic imposes a heavy burden on network performance and is typically not implemented. Instead, indirect aggregate <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> are routinely collected. We consider the problem of estimating point-to-point <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes,</b> x_t, from aggregate <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes,</b> y_t, given information about the network routing protocol encoded in a matrix A. This estimation task can be reformulated as finding the solutions to a sequence of ill-posed linear inverse problems, y_t = A x_t, since the number of origin-destination routes of interest {{is higher than the}} number of aggregate measurements available. Here, we introduce a novel multilevel state-space model of aggregate <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> with realistic features. We implement a naive strategy for estimating unobserved point-to-point <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> from indirect measurements of aggregate traffic, based on particle filtering. We then develop a more efficient two-stage inference strategy that relies on model-based regularization: a simple model is used to calibrate regularization parameters that lead to efficient and scalable inference in the multilevel state-space model. We apply our methods to corporate and academic networks, where we show that the proposed inference strategy outperforms existing approaches and scales to larger networks. We also design a simulation study to explore the factors that influence the performance. Our results suggest that model-based regularization may be an efficient strategy for inference in other complex multilevel models. Comment: 39 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables.
