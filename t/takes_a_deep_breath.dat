I loved {{them so much}} that I immediately stuck them into the seven 7-branch candlesticks {{you see on the}} table. Such auspicious numbers! Unfortunately there is a single candle left, and I don't know where to stick it..."

60|$|Archie {{was not a}} {{man with}} a wide visiting-list among people with families, and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action at the table that he had {{forgotten}} what sixteen is capable of doing with a knife and fork, when it really squares its elbows, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and gets going. The spectacle which he witnessed was consequently at first a little unnerving. The long boy's idea of trifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out for more. He ate like a starving Eskimo. Archie, in the time he had spent in the trenches making the world safe for the working-man to strike in, had occasionally been quite peckish, but he sat dazed before this majestic hunger. This was real eating.|$|E
50|$|The cartoon {{begins as}} a coyote howls from a {{mountain}} top, under a full moon. He <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> as his body inflates to accommodate extra air and releases another howl.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock. The album was released in 1988. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is Brighton Rock's most commercially successful album, peaking at #22 on the Canadian album chart. The album was also certified Gold by the CRIA. [...] Gerry McGhee announced on April 30th, 2013 that <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> will be remastered by Warner Records.|$|R
60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> like <b>a</b> man who {{is about}} to jump an {{obstacle}} in his path.|$|R

50|$|The sign {{is named}} after American {{physician}} John Benjamin Murphy (1857-1916), a prominent Chicago surgeon from the 1880s through the early 1900s, who first described the hypersensitivity to deep palpation in the subcostal area when a patient with gallbladder disease <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
50|$|The film ends {{back in the}} {{psychiatric}} hospital where Jane realises she is dead and in Dorothy's body. The gentleman she is speaking to ends up being the father of David and her husband/lover. After saying her farewells and leaving Dorothy's body Dorothy is seen leaning {{out the window and}} looking at the sky with {{a smile on her face}} as she <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Spirit of Spring in {{the form}} of a faun dances through the {{countryside}} playing his panflute and melting the snow, heralding the end of winter and the beginning of spring. When his revitalizing influence reaches Pluto's doghouse, it causes mushrooms to magically sprout up under Pluto's chin, waking him from his winter slumber. The Spirit of Spring coaxes Pluto out of his doghouse; Pluto shakes off his blanket, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh spring air and skips into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and quietly}} faced her again. 'In the old churchyard, Widderstone; I was looking at--at the gravestones.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Superman derives {{his power}} from the yellow Sun of Earth. Forced under a red sun akin to that of his homeworld, or exposed to red sun radiation, Superman rapidly loses his powers, {{reverting}} to the stature equal to a normal human. This version of Superman also needs to breathe, as he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> in [...] "Apokalips Now... Part 2" [...] before plunging into the ocean, and has a special suit for when he needs to operate in outer space.|$|E

50|$|The {{curator of}} the Virtual Natural Museum, Asha, {{receives}} an anonymous package that contains a small soil sample. She tests the soil and finds no radiation and {{a high level of}} moisture. Although she tests the sample with technological instruments, she also uses her own senses. When she <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and inhales the smell of the soil, she is plunged into a vision, into a deep pool of water. Based on both the mechanical, scientific tests, and her own, biological, visions, Asha believes that life may have returned to the environment outside the community.|$|E
60|$|She was roused {{from these}} semi-delirious speculations {{in the sun}} furnace by Siegmund's waking. He opened his eyes, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and looked smiling at Helena.|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the sharp, invigorating air, {{then looked}} about her, and espying me in {{conversation}} with Giacopo she approached us across the gleaming snow.|$|R
60|$|The new-comer {{threw back}} his head, {{and a look}} that was half wonder, half {{enlightenment}} gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
50|$|Going into utter meltdown, {{she walks}} out of her London office, gets on a train, and {{ends up in the}} middle of nowhere. Asking for {{directions}} at a big, beautiful house, she’s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they’ve hired a lawyer - and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can’t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the ironing board to open. How she <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and begins to cope - and finds love - is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake.|$|E
50|$|It is {{performed}} {{by asking the}} patient to exhale and hold it. The provider then percusses down their back in the intercostal margins (bone will be dull), starting below the scapula, until sounds change from resonant to dull (lungs are resonant, solid organs should be dull). That is where the provider marks the spot. Then the patient <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> in and holds it as the provider percusses down again, marking {{the spot where the}} sound changes from resonant to dull again. Then the provider will measure the distance between the two spots. Repeat on the other side, is usually higher up on the right side. If it is less than 3-5 cm the patient may have a pneumonia or a pneumothorax in which a chest x-ray is diagnostic for either.|$|E
5000|$|Two voices appear {{over the}} scene, one is of The Patient (age 25 at this point) {{and the other}} is a sadistic man known only as [...] "The Doctor" [...] (played by Maximillian Magick). The Doctor states that he has been {{administering}} an experimental drug called [...] "Psychotropica" [...] to The Patient and mercilessly interrogating him about a traumatic and off kilter [...] "nightmare" [...] for quite sometime now (in an effort to [...] "study" [...] his reactions.) The Patient is obviously in great emotional and psychological stress and does not wish to continue the [...] "treatment" [...] but The Doctor forces him to continue for [...] "as long as it takes" [...] under threat of severe [...] "punishment." [...] Reluctantly The Patient agrees to continue relating his painful nightmare for The Doctor. The Patient <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and begins his psychological [...] "trip"...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> I put {{my hands}} {{to the sides of}} my mouth. [...] "Cavor!" [...] I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin {{shouting}} far away.|$|R
60|$|Stephen <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> If {{he knocked}} Mr. Hopper down, he {{certainly}} could not buy her. And {{it was a}} relief to know that the sale had not begun.|$|R
6000|$|He carried {{down the}} stairs into the Courtyard, [...] But there he made no stay, [...] He just tied up his Garters, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] And ran like the wind away.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pig-Pen" [...] {{is known}} for his perpetually filthy {{overalls}} and the cloud of dirt and dust that follows him wherever he goes. When he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> (to sing, for example), the dust rises briefly around him. He sometimes refers to the cloud that surrounds him with pride as the dust of ancient civilizations. He cannot seem to rid himself of the dust for more than the briefest of periods — indeed, in spite of his best efforts, it appears that he cannot stay clean. He is referred to in an early strip as the only person who can get dirty while walking in a snowstorm. Nevertheless, on rare occasions he has very briefly appeared clean, and hence unrecognizable. Once this was in order to impress Violet, of whom he was a bit fond. On another occasion (September 6, 1954), he managed to keep one side of his body clean and presented this clean side to Patty, causing her to believe that he was completely clean.|$|E
50|$|Tom's head {{is stuck}} in the board, but he is safe. Jerry then {{proceeds}} to twist the board like a helicopter propeller and Tom lifts off. The cat stops the board's rotation and unravels his neck, and then frees himself from the board. Tom sighs in relief until he sees that he is falling toward the sea. He grabs the board again and uses it to actually fly like a glider. He dives after an unsuspecting Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed {{through the hole in}} his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through successively shorter widths of pipe in order to reach the mouse, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When the cat realizes this, he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process.|$|E
5000|$|Haaretz critic , {{who noted}} the {{influence}} of haiku, argued that the book is [...] "incredibly aesthetic," [...] underscored that [...] "it {{seems to have been}} written throughout a long period," [...] and, stated that the effect of the poetry and still photography together [...] "creates in one's imagination a cinematic scene," [...] for, he assrted, [...] "the photographs are a transparent reality." [...] He further wrote that the reading created an [...] "experience of sadness, loneliness, and, alienation," [...] and, claimed that the book's themes of domesticity are [...] "very Israeli and very Tel Avivian," [...] as, he further opined, [...] "when one stands before honest, day-to-day, non-mawkish poetry of loneliness, one cannot but identify with it, because this is loneliness without hope for salvation, so, all that remains, is, {{at the end of the}} day, to describe reality in a diary." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "the sadness is tender, the photography even more, and, in the end, the reader <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> happy that the poetry touched him and that the encounter with sadness is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} up to the surface? I want to see you for a moment." [...] Hendricks <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Come up here with me. I want to talk to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said Lawford densely, 'you {{know that}} I love {{you as much}} as ever; but with this--as I am; what would be the good of my saying so?' Mrs Lawford <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|Both youths <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and then}} out on the snowy air rang a sharp, shrill whistle, once, twice, three times, rising and falling in a fashion known only to the cadets of the {{military}} school.|$|R
5000|$|The TARDIS materialises and the Headhunter {{announces that}} they’ve {{arrived on the}} planet Orbis, the {{province}} of a species known as Keltans. Lucie struggles to accept that somewhere out there is the Doctor and she begins to worry about how scruffy she looks. She <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{and opens the door}} - only to find the ship is hovering in mid-air, several metres above a huge ocean. The Headhunter explains that the nearest land is about 50 miles away - then she pushes Lucie through the door and into the great expanse of water. As Lucie thrashes about in panic, the Headhunter says that because of the increased saline content, she should float easily, and the current will take her in the direction she needs. Unfortunately they’re {{in the middle of a}} rather hefty storm front, but she’s sure Lucie will be fine providing she keeps her mouth shut. The Headhunter closes the door and returns alone to the control room. She then proceeds to make a phone call and sends her contact a sequence of co-ordinates, telling the recipient they will be diving at dawn… ...|$|E
5000|$|Air {{is seen as}} male {{because of}} the {{association}} with “the breath of life” and dynamics of storms and winds. In conjunction with that, air is the medium in which movement occurs and is also the element that surrounds everything in nature. This is suggestive of the male’s sexual embrace of a woman. Air is featured many times throughout the play. It is mentioned when Yerma speaks of the wind singing in the trees and when she raises her arms and yawns, which is significant of the deep ritualistic inhalation of the air that made the Earth fertile. Since Yerma cannot be like the Earth and yield or be passive, she must be active in the manifestation of her sexuality. This is what the old woman tried to advise Yerma on, and because the old woman is free as air, she has had two husbands and has given birth to fourteen children. Air is also a subject of interest when Juan berates Yerma for her obsession [...] "with things that drift in the air." [...] Juan, again, does not exhibit the masculine nature that Yerma desperately hopes for. Víctor, however, embodies the masculine element. In one instance, Yerma goes {{to the spot where}} he last stood and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> to inhale natural virility. She realizes that he has always had the potential to fill her fully, but alas she is too late and out of honor must stay with Juan.|$|E
50|$|Cain and Alicia {{have another}} encounter, and {{he tries to}} {{convince}} her to promise him her first-born child in exchange for Roland’s life. She tells {{him to go to}} Hell, and he say, “my dear girl, that’s exactly where I’ve come from,” (200.)The ship is sinking, and Roland is still searching for Alicia when he encounters Cain, who keeps callinghim Jacob. Roland still has not made the connection, since he cannot remember his life before his parents died, but he plays along, asking Cain {{what he has to do}} to save Alicia’s life. Cain says, “I hope you’ll carry out the part of the agreement your father was unable to fulfill… Nothing more. And nothing less” (203.)Tears in his eyes, Roland agrees. Cain tells Roland where Alicia is, and explains that it’s already underwater and she won’t be able to breathe by the time he reaches her. He finds the room, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and searches her out in the darkness. He waits for the ship to touch the bottom of the sea so that the pressure will not pull them back down; when the impact came, the ceiling above began collapsing on top of them, and Roland’s leg was pinned beneath the woody debris. Alicia was struggling to hold her breath, so Roland pulled her to him, and though she tried to resist, he breathed the last of his air into her mouth and then pushed her away towards the surface.Max helps Alicia out of the water; Victor wakes up on the beach and helps the two of them ashore, asking, “Where’s my Roland?” (207.)Roland never returned.|$|E

60|$|Conger stepped down, {{onto the}} damp sidewalk. The guard came swiftly after him, {{and then the}} Speaker. Conger <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the cold air. He studied the dim outline of the {{building}} rising up before them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{amazed at}} her boldness, for this wasn't {{in the least}} how she had meant to begin. And she gazed at the rector anxiously. To her surprise, he {{did not appear to}} be inordinately shocked.|$|R
