25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen did not understand <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother {{had no time to}} help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set [...] "age" [...] for this to occur; it is only when the child learns <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong that they are accountable (...)

The court cited his sentencing by a judge rather than a jury to be in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey (a case that was decided long after the imposition of sentence). Richardson had been the focus of strenuous efforts by death penalty opponents due to his alleged mental deficiencies and because of his youth {{at the time of the}} murders, even though his own psychologist and his mother testified that he [...] "know <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong."

Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off.

50|$|A {{stereogram}} {{consists of}} a pair of two-dimensional frames, one for each eye. Common to both are the widths and heights of objects; their depth is encoded in <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and left eye views. The geometric relationship between an object's third dimension and these position differences is presented below and depends on the location of the stereo-camera lenses and the observer's eyes. Other factors, however, contribute to the depth seen in a stereoscopic view and whether it corresponds to that in the actual object; the act of viewing a stereoscopic display often alters observers' three-dimensional perception.|$|R
2500|$|The Book of Jonah, set in {{the days}} of the Assyrian empire, {{describes}} it (ff; [...] ) as an [...] "exceedingly great city of three days journey in breadth", whose population at that time is given as [...] "more than 120,000". But it is also possible that it took three days to cover all its neighborhoods by walking, which would match the size of ancient Nineveh. The ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamles and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrangle. The ruins of Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states He is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong ("who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand" [...] ) and mercy for the animals in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the [...] "relationship between mental {{retardation}} and the penological purposes {{served by the}} death penalty" [...] justifies a conclusion that executing the mentally retarded is {{cruel and unusual punishment}} that the Eighth Amendment should forbid. In other words, unless it can be shown that executing the mentally retarded promotes the goals of retribution and deterrence, doing so is nothing more than [...] "purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering", making the death penalty cruel and unusual in those cases. Being mentally retarded means that a person not only has substandard intellectual functioning but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction. These deficiencies typically manifest before the age of eighteen. Although they can know <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, these deficiencies mean they have a lesser ability to learn from experience, engage in logical reasoning, and understand the reactions of others. This means that inflicting the death penalty on one mentally retarded individual is less likely to deter other mentally retarded individuals from committing crimes. As for retribution, society's interest in seeing that a criminal get his [...] "just desserts" [...] means that the death penalty must be confined to the [...] "most serious" [...] of murders, not simply the average murder. The goal of retribution is not served by imposing the death penalty on {{a group of people who}} have a significantly lesser capacity to understand why they are being executed.|$|E
2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess retinal {{toxicity}} in a rabbit model after carboplatin delivered as repeated transcorneal intravitreal injection, in order to determine the highest possible safe dose for use in human retinoblastoma “seeding ” tumor chemotherapy. Methods and Results. We used six albino rabbits in an in vivo experiment and injected 0. 008 mg of carboplatin intra-vitreally (iv) 4 times at two-week intervals. 0. 08 mL saline was injected into the left eye. We recorded electroretinograms (ERGs) before the first carboplatin injection and after the fourth injection. Platinum concentration was measured 1  h after the fifth additional injection. We found reduced dark-adapted b-wave amplitudes and, light-adapted b-wave and a-wave amplitudes. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> and left eyes was significant but we found no histopathologic retinal changes. Conclusions. 0. 008 mg of carboplatin is probably the highest possible safe dose for the treatment of retinoblastoma patients. Questionable is direct extrapolation of retinal toxicity from the rabbit eye model to the human eye...|$|R
