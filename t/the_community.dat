5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Committee {{accepts a}} {{community}} declaration, it must then refer the declaration {{to the appropriate}} Community Sub-Committee for consideration. If <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Sub-Committee concludes that the declarant belongs to that community, it must issue a community certificate to the applicant. Otherwise, it must inform the declarant in writing that the application has been rejected. The decision must be communicated to the declarant no later than the eve of nomination day. All decisions of <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at <b>the</b> <b>community</b> supported the transition, and many left. Many were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss <b>the</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
50|$|The second state reform {{took place}} in 1980, when <b>the</b> {{cultural}} <b>communities</b> became <b>Communities.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Communities</b> assumed <b>the</b> authority of <b>the</b> cultural <b>communities</b> with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as <b>the</b> Flemish <b>Community,</b> <b>the</b> French <b>Community</b> and <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>Community.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Community</b> Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>community</b> to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E

5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang music in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> is to {{function}} as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and nothing more.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> French <b>Community</b> Commission {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} powers of <b>the</b> French <b>Community</b> have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to <b>the</b> French <b>Community</b> Commission (for <b>the</b> bilingual language area). <b>The</b> Flemish <b>Community,</b> however, did <b>the</b> opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into <b>the</b> Flemish <b>Community.</b> This {{is related to}} different conceptions in <b>the</b> two <b>communities,</b> one focusing more on <b>the</b> <b>Communities</b> and <b>the</b> other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, <b>the</b> French <b>Community</b> Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|R
