5|$|During {{the setting}} {{up of the}} European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to {{influence}} the shape of <b>the</b> <b>EEAS.</b> MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.|$|E
25|$|The {{coordinator}} and {{representative of the}} CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks {{on behalf of the}} EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 {{on the occasion of the}} first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of 2010 Ashton fought for {{agreement}} between the Council, Parliament and the Commission as to the future shape of <b>the</b> <b>EEAS.</b> The Commission wanted to retain as many of its existing competencies (trade, development, enlargement, representations and so forth) as possible while Parliament fought to gain as much oversight over <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> as possible by demanding scrutiny of appointments and budgets. Parliament removed the last hurdle to the plan on 8 July, when MEPs approved the service by 549 votes for and 78 against with 17 abstentions. The Council approved the transfer of departments to <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> on 20 July. Until <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> became operational, Ashton was only supported by around 30 people on a floor of the Berlaymont building. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> was formally launched at the Commission headquarters in a low key event on 1 December 2010.|$|E
50|$|The non-EU {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> are not {{represented}} in Institutions of the European Union {{such as the}} European Parliament or European Commission. This situation {{has been described as}} “fax democracy”, with Norway waiting for their latest legislation to be faxed from <b>the</b> Commission. However, <b>EEA</b> countries are consulted about new EU legislative proposals and participate in shaping legislation at an early stage. <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement contains provisions for input from the EEA/EFTA countries at various stages before legislation is adopted, including consent at <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Joint Committee. Once approved at <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Joint Committee, it is part of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement and <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> EFTA States must implement it in their national law.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> Joint Committee {{consists}} of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) and has the function of amending <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement to include relevant EU legislation.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> has 33 member {{countries}} and six cooperating countries. The European environment information and observation network (Eionet) is a partnership network of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and <b>the</b> countries. <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> {{is responsible for}} developing the network and coordinating its activities. To do so, <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> works closely together with national focal points, typically national environment agencies or environment ministries. They are responsible for coordinating national networks involving many institutions (about 350 in all).|$|R
50|$|However Ashton's {{draft plan}} for <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> {{included}} proposals for <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> {{to take responsibility}} for Neighbourhood Policy (currently assigned to the Enlargement Commissioner) and international development at least. Under a compromise with the Commission, it was agreed development would be split, with <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> taking on three of the five planning cycles from the Commission. How this division of labour will work in practice only began being tested in 2012 as the 2014-2020 programming exercise began.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> manages general foreign relations, {{security}} and defence policies and controls the Situation Centre (see intelligence below). However, although the HR and <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> can prepare initiatives, member states {{make the final}} policy decisions and the Commission also plays a part in technical implementation. The HR must report to the European Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> would have desks dedicated to all the countries and regional organisations in the world, and specialised units for democracy, human rights and defence.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} function of <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> is {{to assist the}} High Representative {{in the conduct of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in his/her capacities as President of the Foreign Affairs Council and Vice-President of the European Commission. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> does not propose or implement policy in its own name, but prepares acts to be adopted by the High Representative, the European Commission or the Council. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> is also in charge of EU diplomatic missions (delegations) and intelligence and crisis management structures (CMPD, CPCC, EUMS, INTCEN).|$|E
50|$|Were the UK to join <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> as an EFTA member, {{it would}} {{sign up to}} {{existing}} EU internal market legislation {{that is part of}} <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement. Changes to the internal market would be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement subject to the consent of the UK at <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Joint Committee; once in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement, <b>the</b> UK would have to incorporate these into UK Law. The EU is also required to conduct extensive consultations with EEA EFTA members beforehand via its many committees and cooperative bodies. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> {{is under}} the {{authority}} of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR), a post also created by the Treaty of Lisbon. <b>The</b> <b>EEAS</b> was formed by merger of the external relations departments of the European Commission and of the Council, which were joined by staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the Member States. Although it supports both the Commission and the Council, <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> is independent from them and has its own staff, as well as a separate section in the EU budget.|$|E
5000|$|However, Former European Commission adviser Dr Fraser Cameron {{argued that}} [...] "the {{criticism}} one hears of Ashton is pretty strong {{and it will}} be difficult to overcome the bad press she has. It represents a problem for <b>the</b> <b>EEAS,</b> when it comes to public diplomacy, and reflects the system we have for choosing leaders. Too often, <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> is waiting until the last member state signs up to the position; they could set out a view much earlier. When you look at places like Egypt - Cathy has been five times, but people are still not quite sure what <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> does or who speaks for Europe. The glass is less than half full. I think the criticism of Ashton is down to style and morale in <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> is not as good as it should be." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Ashton {{appointed}} a Polish security operative {{to head a}} working group designing the security architecture of the EEAS; particularly the physical security of <b>the</b> <b>EEAS</b> building and its communication network with its embassies.

30|$|The {{nature of}} the moving cost to Sweden and its {{relation}} to skills before and after <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> are important because they influence the payoff involved in moving.

40|$|The oil {{refining}} industry in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> faces future challenges. Some of these challenges are competition from non-EEA refiners, increased import of petroleum products to <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and unsophisticated technology of existing refineries. If the {{oil refining}} industry in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> will {{change in the}} future, what impact will these changes have on the intermediate product tanker segment trading in <b>the</b> <b>EEA?</b> These possible future changes in the refining industry are essential for ship-owners’ decision making in regards to efficient operation of intermediate product tankers in <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how and why the oil refining industry in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> will develop until year 2025 and how these changes will affect the intermediate product tanker segment. To fulfil the purpose, a case study has been performed. The primary information for this study has been retrieved by conducting ten interviews with semi-structured questions. The result from this study shows that the refining industry in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> faces several future challenges. Increased competition from non-EEA refiners and increased import of petroleum products have been highlighted as the main challenges for the refining industry in EEA. This study also shows that the intermediate product tankers still are expected to be needed for regional transportation within <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> However, <b>the</b> intermediate product segment faces competition from larger segments and therefore it is important that the segment keeps its flexibility compared to larger segments to not lose its market shares. The size of existing intermediate product tankers is appropriate and therefore the size should retain in order to keep the segment´s flexibility...|$|R

40|$|This thesis first {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} key concepts and rationalities that are {{dominant in the}} content of the Environmental Enforcement Act (<b>EEA).</b> <b>The</b> research project concludes that despite legislative shifts towards increased punishment and deterrence, key concepts and rationalities such as the importance of economic globalization, the continuation of risk-management and anthropocentric values, and the dominance of staples development can be observed {{in the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> also reflects growing concerns towards managing known structural economic problems such as Canada’s staples development and economic globalization. Secondly, this thesis critically evaluates whether <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> is likely to contribute towards the effectiveness of Canadian environmental governance strategies. <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> is likely to be ineffective based on observations of structural challenges in environmental governance and the Canadian political economic context.
