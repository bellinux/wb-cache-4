By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able <b>to</b> <b>tease</b> <b>out</b> what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted <b>to</b> <b>tease</b> <b>out</b> subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

Scientific evidence is gradually replacing evidence based on the principle of orality or spontaneity. And yet, judges are not scientifically trained. There is a convergence of the English adversarial system, especially in criminal proceedings, with the Continental inquisitorial system; and, what is more, the proliferation of statutes on the law of evidence and the wide discretionary powers vested in judges to admit all types of evidence raise serious issues of justice and ‘open impartiality’ as distinct from ‘close impartiality’.

It examines the themes, narrative structure, and cinematic style employed in the Ghanaian video film Scorned (2008), comparing it to the key elements of the 1930 s – 1950 s woman’s film genre of Hollywood. We argue that Scorned follows the traditional genre of the woman’s Hollywood movie while simultaneously subverting some of the ingrained conventions and expectations of that genre. The film merges and renegotiates the generic elements of the woman’s film as represented in the Hollywood woman’s film genre and melodrama by focusing on the underpinning ideologies, plot, and aesthetics in making visible the Ghanaian woman’s experience and constructing a female consciousness. Such engagements can contribute <b>to</b> <b>teasing</b> <b>out</b> some of the generic elements, which could constitute the African woman’s film...|$|R

2500|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of insect colonies makes them theoretically susceptible to infection en masse; the high similarity {{of each group}} members genome means that each is susceptible (and resistant) to the same parasites, whilst experimental manipulation has demonstrated that genetically heterogenous colonies of B. terrestris have lower levels of parasite infection than homogenous colonies. To increase genetic diversity, colonies can {{increase the number of}} queens and/or increase the number of mating partners a queen has— it is thought these social immune benefits may explain the seemingly costly polyandry found in social insect colonies.

[...] Ongoing theoretical and empirical work is seeking <b>to</b> <b>tease</b> <b>out</b> the scenarios in which these immune benefits of genetic heterogeneity can be negated due to concomitant costs, e.g., the increased intra-colony conflict and/or susceptibility to an increasing number of parasites which comes with increased genetic diversity.|$|E

We argue that doublethink provides a means of containing contradiction such that it is neither acknowledged as contradiction nor experienced as uncomfortable. We consider the findings in relation to notions of role positions which reflect/constitute different ways of ordering an individual’s experience, the mobilization of an overarching idiom to ‘contain’ the contradiction, and the privileging of practice over reflexivity...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{of the age}} of the Somerset towers, {{there are}} few records showing exactly when and by whom they were built.

Brereton offering new classifications in 1904. Wickham, who spent time as the vicar of Martock and later at East Brent, writing in 1952, accepted much of the classification scheme set out in earlier works, based on age and the arrangement of the windows. He argued, however, that the North Somerset group had been wrongly classified. Based on an early attempt to bring computer analysis {{to the study of the}} towers, Poyntz Wright in 1981 published a taxonomy of the towers <b>to</b> <b>tease</b> <b>out</b> patterns reflecting the chronology and teams of builders behind their construction. Based on details such as the numbers and arrangement of windows; presence, arrangement and decoration of pinnacles and merlons; and arrangement, location, and styling of buttresses, he described and proposed rough dates for [...] "generations" [...] of Somerset towers. For example, Poyntz Wright proposed [...] "The Churchill Generation" [...] as an early group including churches at Churchill, Compton Martin, and Compton Bishop.

This article suggests a sociologically-informed quantitative approach <b>to</b> <b>teasing</b> <b>out</b> {{the impact of}} women's roles and relationships on their sleep, while also taking into account women's socio-economic characteristics and health status. This was accomplished through analysis of the UK Women's Sleep Survey 2003, based on self-completion questionnaires from a national sample of 1445 women aged over 40. The article assesses {{the ways in which}} three central aspects of women's gender roles: the night-time behaviours of their partners, night-time behaviours of their children, and night-time worries - impact on women's sleep, while also considering how disadvantaged socio-economic circumstances and poor health may compromise women's sieep. Using bivariate analysis followed by hierarchical multiple regression models, we examine the relative importance of different aspects of women's gender roles. The key factors implicated in the poor sleep quality of midlife and older women are their partner's snoring, night-time worries and concerns, poor health status (especially experiencing pain at night), disadvantaged socio-economic status (especially having lower educational qualifications) and for women with children, their children coming home late at night. © Sociological Research Online...|$|R

One of the difficult issues confronting anyone wishing to analyse neoliberalism is the relationship between, on the one hand, neoliberalism as a set of propositions regarding {{the nature of}} human society and how it should be organised, and, on the other hand, neoliberalism as a set of policy practices and economic processes.
