5|$|On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor {{registered}} a gamma-ray burst {{that lasted}} approximately 15seconds. It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic space probe designed {{to study the}} Sun, and by <b>the</b> <b>Burst</b> and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. <b>The</b> <b>burst</b> also occurred {{within the field of}} view of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> to an error box—a small area around the specific position to account for the error in the position—with a diameter of approximately 10arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|About 5hours after <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> the {{apparent}} {{magnitude of the}} object—a logarithmic measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object—was 20.3±0.3 in the U-band (the ultraviolet region of the spectrum) and 21.2±0.1 in the R-band (the red region of the spectrum). The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of <b>the</b> <b>burst,</b> but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} {{of a large number}} of optical <b>bursts</b> in <b>the</b> Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) EXO 0748 - 676 simultaneous with <b>the</b> thermonuclear X-ray <b>bursts.</b> <b>The</b> X-ray and <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts</b> are detected in a long observation of this source with the XMM-Newton observatory. This has increased the number of thermonuclear X-ray <b>bursts</b> in <b>the</b> LMXBs with simultaneous optical detection by several factors. <b>The</b> optical <b>bursts</b> are found to have a linear rise followed by a slow, somewhat exponential decay. Most of <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts</b> have longer rise and decay timescale compared to <b>the</b> corresponding X-ray <b>bursts.</b> We have determined the X-ray and optical excess photon counts in <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> that allow us to look at the optical to X-ray burst fluence ratio for each <b>burst</b> and <b>the</b> ratio as a function of <b>the</b> X-ray <b>burst</b> intensity and as a function of the orbital phase. The delay between the onset of <b>the</b> X-ray <b>bursts</b> and <b>the</b> onset of <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts</b> have also been measured and is found to have an average value of 3. 25 seconds. We do not find any convincing evidence of orbital phase dependence of the following parameters: X-ray to optical delay, rise time of <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts,</b> and optical to X-ray burst intensity ratio as would be expected if <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts</b> were produced by reprocessing from the surface of the secondary star that is facing the compact star. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> optical <b>bursts</b> are produced by reprocessing of the X-rays in the accretion disk, the onset of <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> is not expected to have a sharp, linear shape as is observed in a few of <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> in EXO 0748 - 676. We emphasise the fact that simultaneous optical observations of <b>the</b> X-ray <b>bursts</b> in multiple wavelength bands will enable further detailed investigations of the reprocessing phenomena, including any non-linear effect of the X-ray irradiation.

5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|The KONUS-B instrument, {{designed}} by the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10keV to 8MeV energy. They consisted of NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals 200mm in diameter by 50mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5mm thick lead layer. <b>The</b> <b>burst</b> detection threshold was 500 to 50 microjoules per square meter (510 to 510 erg/cm²), depending on <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> spectrum and rise time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8s.|$|E
5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to, for instance, {{a rise in}} {{the plasma}} sodium concentration, vasopressin neurons also discharge action potentials in bursts, but these bursts are much longer and are less intense than <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> displayed by oxytocin neurons, and <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> in vasopressin cells are not synchronised.|$|R
40|$|Coherent {{oscillations}} and {{the evolution}} of the X-ray spectrum during <b>the</b> thermonuclear X-ray <b>bursts</b> have been studied intensively but separately. Recently we analysed all archival data of the two burst-rich sources 4 U 1636 - 53 and 4 U 1728 - 34 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We found that during <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> time, especially <b>the</b> cooling phase, <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> in which <b>the</b> blackbody radius remains more or less constant for ≳ 2 s show coherent oscillations, whereas those <b>bursts</b> in which <b>the</b> blackbody radius changes rapidly show no coherent oscillations. This {{is the first time that}} <b>the</b> presence of <b>burst</b> oscillations in <b>the</b> tail of X-ray bursts is associated with a systematic behaviour of the spectral parameters in that phase of <b>the</b> <b>bursts.</b> This result is consistent with predictions of models that associate the oscillations in the tail of X-ray <b>bursts</b> with <b>the</b> propagation of a cooling wake in the material on the neutron-star surface during the decay of <b>the</b> <b>bursts...</b>|$|R
50|$|Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>burst's</b> afterglows {{suggested}} {{two models}} to explain <b>the</b> <b>burst's</b> afterglow. In <b>the</b> first, <b>the</b> <b>burst's</b> ejecta were collimated into a jet with a half-angle greater than 6° and interacted with a high-density medium. In the second, the jet had a half-angle greater than 2° and interacted with a low-density medium. If {{the characteristics of}} the first model, which were similar to those of GRB 050724, are representative of all short GRBs, then the emission jets of short GRBs are less collimated and less energetic than those of long GRBs.|$|R
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> in deep convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E

5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. <b>The</b> <b>burst</b> mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 energy channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{afterglow}} of GRB970508 {{reached a}} peak total luminosity 19.82days after <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> was detected. It then faded {{with a power}} law slope over about 100days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V=25.4±0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70±0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of z=0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether.

Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E

40|$|In February 2011, a <b>burst</b> {{event of}} <b>the</b> H_ 2 O maser in Orion KL (Kleinmann-Low object) has started after 13 -year silence. This {{is the third}} time to detect such {{phenomena}} in Orion KL, followed by those in 1979 - 1985 and 1998. We have carried out astrometric observations of <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> H_ 2 O maser features in Orion KL with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry), a Japanese VLBI network dedicated for astrometry. The total flux of <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> feature at <b>the</b> LSR velocity of 7. 58 km s^- 1 reaches 4. 4 × 10 ^ 4 Jy in March 2011. The intensity of <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> feature is three orders of magnitudes larger {{than that of the}} same velocity feature in the quiescent phase in 2006. Two months later, another new feature appears at the LSR velocity of 6. 95 km s^- 1 in May 2011, separated by 12 mas north of the 7. 58 km s^- 1 feature. Thus, <b>the</b> current <b>burst</b> occurs at two spatially different features. <b>The</b> <b>bursting</b> masers are elongated along the northwest-southeast direction as reported in <b>the</b> previous <b>burst</b> in 1998. We determine the absolute positions of <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> features for <b>the</b> first time ever with a submilli-arcsecond (mas) accuracy. Their positions are coincident with the shocked molecular gas called the Orion Compact Ridge. We tentatively detect the absolute proper motions of <b>the</b> <b>bursting</b> features toward southwest direction. It is most likely that the outflow from the radio source I or another young stellar object interacting with the Compact Ridge is a possible origin of the H_ 2 O maser burst.

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array.

While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E

5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: <b>the</b> <b>burst</b> frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E
5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. <b>The</b> <b>burst</b> timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
