5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E

25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} have a {{high enough}} tolerance for humans to inhabit residential neighborhoods and raid bird feeders for millet, corn, and sunflower seeds. Some people who feed and watch birds for entertainment also intentionally feed seeds and nuts to <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> for the same reason. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> also raid gardens for tomatoes, corn, strawberries, and other garden crops. Sometimes they eat the tomato seeds and discard the rest. On very rare occasions, when their usual food sources are scarce, eastern gray squirrels also prey upon insects, frogs, small rodents including other squirrels, and small birds, their eggs, and young. They also gnaw on bones, antlers, and turtle shells – likely {{as a source of}} minerals scarce in their normal diet.|$|E

Porky then chases <b>the</b> <b>squirrel</b> up <b>the</b> tree, but is stopped by a limb placed by <b>the</b> <b>squirrel,</b> who then cuts the pig's suspenders making him fall. Almost immediately after, Porky {{is on the other}} side of the tree with a shotgun, and fires.

25|$|Ground {{squirrels}} eat bulbs, fruits, grasses, herbs, {{insects and}} shrubs. They do not hoard food so foraging {{is a daily}} activity. The Cape ground squirrel usually doesn't have to drink and it gets moisture from the food it eats. A ground squirrel’s daily activities are made of around 70% feeding, 15-20% being vigilant and around 10% socializing. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> use {{the position of the}} sun as an orientation marker to hide and recover their food.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{the eastern}} gray {{squirrel}} is not regulated by natural predators, {{other than the}} European pine marten, which is generally absent from England and Wales. This has aided its rapid population growth and {{has led to the}} species being classed as a pest. Measures are being devised to reduce its numbers, including one plan for celebrity television chefs to promote the idea of eating <b>the</b> <b>squirrels.</b> In areas where relict populations of red squirrels survive, such as the islands of Anglesey and Brownsea, programs exist to eradicate gray squirrels in an effort to allow red squirrel populations to recover.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Sciuridae, the eastern gray {{squirrel}} is a scatter-hoarder; it hoards food in numerous small caches for later recovery. Some caches are quite temporary, especially those made near the site of a sudden abundance of food which can be retrieved within hours or days for reburial in a more secure site. Others are more permanent and are not retrieved until months later. Each squirrel is estimated to make several thousand caches each season. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> have very accurate spatial memory for the locations of these caches, and use distant and nearby landmarks to retrieve them. Smell is used partly to uncover food caches, and also to find food in other squirrels' caches. Scent can be unreliable when the ground is too dry or covered in snow.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant {{of the two}} is a longhorn beetle (Phymatodes nitidus) that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. This cuts the vascular water supply to the cone scales, allowing the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open {{over the next several}} months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasi) that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.|$|E

2500|$|Nelson's {{antelope}} squirrels {{are social}} animals. [...] When individually {{taken out of}} their home range and released in an unknown area, they seem helpless and confused. They do not expend much energy throughout the day because of the extreme temperatures in their environment. In fact, when in the direct sunlight, a temperature of 31-32°C can kill them. Therefore, there is little activity from <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> during {{the heat of the}} day. [...] Although {{there is no evidence of}} hibernation, <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> are not bothered by the cold and can survive temperatures below freezing, in their burrows. They are not early risers and are usually not seen until after sunrise, however it does forage in the morning and evening, avoiding the midday heat. Around noon <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> disappear into their burrows and are not seen again until about 2 pm at the earliest. On moderate days, <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> will take their time foraging, in contrast to bringing as much food back to their burrows as quickly as possible on hot or cold days. <b>The</b> <b>squirrels</b> are also known to fully stretch out and roll over in the dust on the ground. [...] These dust baths appear to be very enjoyable activities for <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> and may also be used to prevent infestation of parasites.|$|E
2500|$|It is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} seeds, green vegetation, insects, and dried animal matter. It {{occasionally}} caches food. Redstem fialree (Erodium cicutarium) and brome grass (Bromus rubens) are important food items for <b>the</b> <b>squirrels.</b> However, their diet may differ {{depending on the}} time of day or time of year. [...] Green vegetation is the most common diet type from December to mid-April because it is the most abundant during this period. [...] Likewise, insects make up more than 90% of the squirrel's diet from mid-April to December because they are more abundant. [...] Although seeds are available for most of the year, it is not the preferable diet of <b>the</b> <b>squirrels.</b> They will choose insects or green vegetation when available over seeds, even if the seeds are more abundant and easier to access. [...] Some speculate that this could be due to the higher amount of water in insects and green vegetation, which would be necessary for the species to survive in such a hot, dry climate. [...] Unfortunately for the Nelson's antelope squirrel, there is not an abundant water source nearby. [...] Under laboratory conditions, <b>the</b> <b>squirrels</b> readily accept water.
