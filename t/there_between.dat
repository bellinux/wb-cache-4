In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got <b>there.</b> <b>Between</b> May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E

He studied at the senior high school in Semarang, before spending some time at the Suikerschool in Surabaya, later arriving in Batavia (now Jakarta). <b>There,</b> <b>between</b> 1927 and 1937, he worked as an amanuensis at the School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen.|$|E

5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign <b>there</b> <b>between</b> 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|Michel's {{older brother}} Albert had already become a patissier (pastry chef), and Roux {{followed}} him into this field {{at the age of}} fourteen. He became an apprentice to Camille Loyal in Belleville, working seventy-hour weeks. Michel's tasks at the pâtisserie included making up to sixty Galette des Rois over the course of three days for Epiphany. Albert found Michel further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work <b>there.</b> <b>Between</b> 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria. He was awarded the Médaille commémorative des opérations de sécurité et de maintien de l'ordre en Afrique du Nord.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian Church, {{known as}} 'St. Andrew’s Church', was {{established}} by the first missionary in Chamba, the Reverend William Ferguson, who served <b>there</b> <b>between</b> 1863 and 1873. The foundation stone for building the new church was laid by the Raja of Chamba on 17 February 1899, {{in the presence of}} the Scottish reverend Dr. M’Clymont who had come from Scotland. The Raja had contributed a generous grant to build the church and ensured that it was exquisitely built in fine stone masonry. The walls are supported by buttresses, and lancer arch windows provide the light and ventilation. Several schools are run by the Mission located within the church precincts.|$|E

5|$|The {{town was}} {{destroyed}} and the Hungarians headed for Bacău, which they also burned down; then {{they continued to}} Roman and stayed <b>there</b> <b>between</b> 29 November and 7 December. According to a chronicle, Stephen sent envoys to negotiate a peace treaty, but the two factions could not agree and the war continued. Roman was put to flames and the Hungarians killed everyone they encountered, “without considering their sex, age, or looks.” After three days of marching and more pillaging, they reached Baia where Corvinus met with a Hungarian {{by the name of}} Sythotus, who revealed to him the Moldavian position, their numbers (12,000), and their plan to attack before dusk. The Moldavians were encamped further north, between Moldova River and Șomuz creek. Corvinus ordered the city to be fortified with “ramparts, ditches and a ring of wagons,” as the men were told to be prepared for battle and guards were sent to guard strategic points.|$|E
5|$|West's {{arguments}} {{have been}} highly influential, but other scholars {{have arrived at}} different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c.575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed <b>there</b> <b>between</b> 630 and 590 BCE, viewing {{the composition of the}} Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c.555 BCE) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem.|$|E
