5|$|Determined to {{make this}} the king's happiest {{birthday}} ever and save the day, SpongeBob sets out to find <b>Triton</b> and bring him to the party. Once found, <b>Triton</b> initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable to figure it out, SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, <b>Triton</b> destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing {{that something is wrong}} at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, <b>Triton</b> attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how <b>Triton</b> destroyed Bikini Bottom, is pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{cutbacks in}} defense spending, {{as well as}} the expense of {{operating}} her twin nuclear reactors, <b>Tritons</b> scheduled 1967 overhaul was canceled, and the submarine—along with 60 other vessels—was slated for inactivation. [...] While <b>Tritons</b> twin reactor plant was designed to be refueled by a submarine tender like other U.S. nuclear submarines, because of the complexity of her zirconium-clad fuel elements, <b>Tritons</b> previous re-fueling had been done in a shipyard during her 1962–1964 overhaul. [...] Although new fuel elements were procured and available for installation, <b>Tritons</b> overhaul was canceled, [...] a source of controversy.

All of them identified <b>Triton</b> as being a prime target and a separate <b>Triton</b> lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and <b>Triton</b> went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of Triton’s capture {{has been the}} subject of several theories over the years. One of them postulates that <b>Triton</b> was captured in a three-body encounter.

5|$|Discovering that Vanessa is {{actually}} Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs <b>Triton</b> about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is {{the girl who}} saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. <b>Triton</b> furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks <b>Triton</b> into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as <b>Triton</b> {{is transformed into a}} polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills Flotsam and Jetsam in the process. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions.|$|E
5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, <b>Triton,</b> which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, <b>Triton</b> was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that <b>Triton</b> was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. <b>Triton</b> is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that <b>Triton</b> was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} the limb of <b>Triton</b> using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated {{the presence of an}} atmosphere and an exotic surface.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{reducing}} the tritium fraction in DT fusion reactors is investigated by means of enhancing the fusion reactivity using high-power ICRF heating in heliotron reactors. We assume a situation that the density fraction of <b>tritons</b> is less than 10 %, and the minority <b>tritons</b> are accelerated by ICRF waves. We then analyze the increase of fusion reactivity by assuming an effective temperature of high-energy <b>tritons</b> and examine the possibility of realizing a fusion reactor with this concept. The required ICRF power and the generated fusion power are also estimated...|$|R
5|$|Inward of <b>Triton</b> {{are seven}} small regular satellites, {{all of which}} have {{prograde}} orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer irregular satellites other than <b>Triton,</b> including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when <b>Triton</b> was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular satellites, Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.|$|E
