5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E

The title {{made me think of}} an entire generation of Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us with {{the meaning of a}} word. For Wittgenstein, the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word stands for does not give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
25|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Guggenheim {{retrospective}} and its catalogue did was {{to afford}} an American critical audience a comprehensive view of Beuys's practice and rhetoric. Whereas Beuys had been a central figure in the post-war European artistic consciousness for some time, American audiences had previously only had partial and fleeting access to his work. In 1980, and building on the scepticism voiced by Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers, who in 1972 Open Letter had compared Beuys to Wagner, art historian Benjamin Buchloh (who was teaching at Staatliche Kunstakademie, just like Beuys) launched a polemically forceful attack on Beuys. The essay was (and remains) the most vitriolic and thoroughgoing critique of both Beuys's rhetoric (referred to as “simple-minded utopian drivel”) and persona (Buchloh regards Beuys as both infantile and messianic).|$|E

500|$|Brownlee {{wanted to}} call an {{election}} in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta's natural resources, but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus.

500|$|Reviewers {{discussed}} the acting. Peter Gicas of E! News noted that Fox and Monaghan portray [...] "combustible behavior the tune is hellbent on describing." [...] The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman wrote that they play their roles perfectly and {{help make the}} video powerful. Entertainment Weeklys Whitney Pastorek found the violent acting sexually appealing, while Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote that the cast's appeal [...] "hypnotize" [...] viewers. Paskin noted the use of sepia toning in the burning-house scenes. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio commented that the video leaves viewers to decide [...] "if it's a good thing or a bad <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pair always end up reconciling." [...] Mikey Fresh of Vibe commented that Fox's natural reaction when Monaghan pierces the wall and almost hits her is an [...] "incredible act of vulnerability". L Magazines Benjamin Sutton likened the scene in which the characters burn to the Marvel Comics character Chris Bradley, whom Monaghan portrays in the 2009 action film [...] As of October 2017, the video is the site's 33rd most viewed video, with more than 1.4 billion views.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{noted that}} the Federal Housing Administration's {{crucial role in the}} nation's housing market, {{providing}} low-down-payment mortgages during the crisis of 2007–2010 when no mortgages would otherwise have been available, [...] "helped avert full-scale disaster" [...] by helping people purchase or refinance homes and thereby putting a floor under falling home prices. However, due to the tighter flow of credit from the banks, total FHA loans in 2009 were four times that of 2006, raising concern that year that if the economy were to dip back into recession, more Fed funds could be required to keep those loans afloat. [...] Frank's response was that the additional defaults— 2.2% more of the total portfolio in 2009 than the year before— were worth the economic stabilization of the broader policy, noting [...] "It was an effort to keep prices from falling too fast." [...] In that context, he opined, [...] "I don't think it's a bad <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bad loans occurred." [...] In fact, the unprecedented number of loans made since 2008 were noted to be performing far better than those in the prior two years.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode [...] "The stories in the North and Meereen stayed a bit quiet as all their action got taken care of last week, leaving Cersei's big plot to destroy the Sept and {{everyone}} in it as this finale's big suspenseful and explosive set piece. Elsewhere, there were big reveals and revenge kills that helped everything {{add up to a}} very surprising and satisfying season finale." [...] He continued by praising how the trial sequence played out on screen, writing [...] "The actual staging and pacing of the trial and violent reckoning was really cool, with everyone getting dressed and little puzzle pieces falling into place, little birds leading men to their deaths, and Ramin Djawadi's excellent score." [...] He gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal similarly gave praise to the episode, writing [...] "It's a good <b>thing...</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> season finale was full of massive developments, tying up several plot threads while leaving some others dangling in the most tantalizing way. This was the most complete episode of Game of Thrones yet, and possibly the best." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Dany and her fleet are finally sailing to Westeros, her great dragons casting shadows over the waves. It's on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} recounts could not be {{completed}} was the various stoppages ordered by the various branches and levels of the judiciary, most notably the Supreme Court itself.

Supporters of the stay — such as Charles Fried — contend that the validity of the stay was vindicated by the ultimate decision on the merits and that the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stay prevented was a recount [...] "being done in an unconstitutional way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Mbocor was sacrificed {{in order}} to bring animal life on Earth, the {{narrative}} is imprecise on the identity of this animal.

It is also probable that Mbocor is the same as Ɓoxo-koƥ (the dog of the forest − [...] "jackal"). However, at present, nobody knows what kind of animal Mbocor was.

2500|$|The {{whole book}} {{is a mixture of}} Hellenism and Hebraism, in which the same method of allegory is applied to Homer and Hesiod as to Moses. Starting from the {{assertion}} of Moses that God is [...] "a devouring fire" [...] (Deuteronomy 4:24), Simon combined therewith the philosophy of Heraclitus which made fire the first principle of all things. This first principle he denominated a [...] "Boundless Power," [...] and he declared it to dwell in the sons of men, beings born of flesh and blood. But fire was not the simple <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> many imagined, and Simon distinguished between its hidden and its manifest qualities, maintaining that the former were the cause of the latter.
