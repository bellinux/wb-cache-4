25|$|In {{the same}} article, he expounded upon {{the absurdity of}} a {{monetary}} {{system in which the}} taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} that the Government met its {{objectives}} in terms of delivering a privatised Royal Mail with an employee share scheme. However, {{it is not clear whether}} value for money was achieved and whether Ministers obtained the appropriate return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> We agree with the National Audit Office that the Government met its primary objective. On the basis of the performance of the share price to date, it appears that the taxpayer has missed out on significant value.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternative}} opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia {{objected to the}} Court's consideration of the case with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act, finding no party in the case with standing to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded {{that it did not}} violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.|$|E
25|$|A {{report in}} 2005 by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee {{found that the}} cost of the process of selling the Dome and {{surrounding}} land (which increased to 170 acres from the initial offering of the 48 acres enclosed by the Dome) and managing the Dome until the deal was closed was £28.7 million. £33 million were expected to be returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> by 2009. The value of the 48 acres occupied by the Dome was estimated at £48 million, which could have been realised by demolishing the structure, but it was considered preferable to preserve the Dome.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale and}} the cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> of the funeral, inaccurately {{estimated}} before the event at up to £10million in total, was also criticised by public figures including the Bishop of Grantham, Lord Prescott and George Galloway. Thatcher's family agreed to meet {{part of the cost}} of the funeral, unspecified but thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation. The government would fund the remaining costs, including security. After the event, it was reported by 10 Downing Street that in fact the total public spending on the funeral was £3.6million, of which £3.1million (86 per cent) had been the costs of police and security.|$|E
25|$|Taxpayer {{standing}} is {{the concept}} that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file {{a lawsuit against the}} taxing body if that body allocates funds {{in a way that the}} taxpayer feels is improper. The United States Supreme Court has held that taxpayer standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the United States government, unless the narrower Flast test is met. The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., United States v. Richardson.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer {{has a right to}} have the IRS explain why he or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E

500|$|Democratic National Committee Chairman Stephen A. Mitchell {{called for}} Nixon's {{resignation}} from the ticket, saying that [...] "Senator Nixon knows that [...] is morally wrong. General Eisenhower {{knows that it}} is morally wrong. The American people {{know that it is}} morally wrong." [...] On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story [...] "a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, fellow travelers, and former communists". Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The Sacramento Bee termed Nixon [...] "the pet protégé of a special interest group of rich southern Californians... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist." [...] The Pasadena Star-News, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to {{on the grounds that the}} Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} of the single's release, further full-page adverts {{appeared}} in the national press, this time asking readers [...] "***k The Millennium: Yes/No?", with a telephone number—the [...] "Millennium Crisis Line"—provided for voting: [...] "If you want to fuck the millennium, press '1'. If not, press '2'." [...] The adverts were placed under the pseudonym K2 Plant Hire Ltd., who duly claimed that 18,436 (89%) of respondents wished to fuck the millennium. [...] Thus, on 31 October 1997, K2 Plant Hire announced [...] "The People's Pyramid", an estimated -high structure built from as many house bricks as there were British 20th century births (estimated by the duo as 87 million), with no cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> [...] According to Melody Maker, a statement posted on K2 Plant Hire's website [...] "pointedly contrast the intended virtues of their People's Pyramid with the drawbacks of the officially sponsored Millennium Dome". [...] The Guardian noted drily that the idea [...] "would appear to be far-fetched even by their own standards" [...] and [...] "Planning permission might pose a problem." [...] The Pyramid was never built.|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, the {{eviction}} of Claremont Road took place, bringing {{an end to}} the M11 {{link road}} resistance as a major physical protest. Bailiffs, accompanied by the police in full riot gear, carried out the eviction over several days, and the Central line, running adjacent to the road, was suspended. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> was over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, [...] "I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060." [...] Cohen complained in parliament about police brutality, stating [...] "were not many of my constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?" [...] The then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, pointed out that there had already been three public enquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against the line of the route.|$|E
50|$|Many jurisdictions {{require that}} the tax year conform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> fiscal year for {{financial}} reporting. The United States is a notable exception: taxpayers may choose any tax year, but must keep books and records for such year.|$|R

2500|$|In 2010/11, nearly 25,000 cattle were {{slaughtered}} in England alone, and {{the cost}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> of disease control was £91 million; 90% of this amount was accounted for by Government-funded cattle testing and compensation payments to farmers for slaughtered animals. During 2010, 10.8% of herds in England were under restrictions, whilst in the West and South-West, this figure was {{more than double the}} average at 22.8%. [...] In a Defra report in 2011, it was stated that the number of new bTB incidents in England rose in 2010, compared to 2009, and suggested the disease situation was not improving.

50|$|First {{approved}} by the Eighth Circuit in 1935 in Gleckman v. United States, the bank deposit cash expenditure method identifies tax evasion through review of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> bank deposits. This method of investigation primarily focuses on whether <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> total bank deposits throughout the year are equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> reported income. This method is most appropriate when the majority of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> income is deposited in the bank and most expenses are paid by check.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{allows a}} taxpayer {{to pay an}} upcoming instalment of provisional tax at a date {{in the future that}} suits them. <b>The</b> <b>taxpayer</b> pays an upfront finance fee and a tax pooling intermediary makes a date-stamped deposit equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amount financed into its tax pool account on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> on <b>the</b> provisional tax date. <b>The</b> <b>taxpayer</b> then pays <b>the</b> intermediary at the agreed upon date in the future and the intermediary arranges <b>the</b> tax deposit <b>to</b> be transferred from its tax pool <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> IRD account.|$|R
2500|$|However, Federal Reserve {{officials}} {{indicated to}} Congress that [...] "if the Presidential $1 Coin Program does not stimulate substantial transactional demand for dollar coins, {{the requirement that}} the Mint nonetheless produce Sacagawea dollars would result in costs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> without any offsetting benefits." [...] In that event, the Federal Reserve indicated that it would [...] "strongly recommend that Congress reassess the one-third requirement." [...] The one-third requirement was later changed to one-fifth by the Native American $1 Coin Act, passed on September 20, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In Florida, a {{taxpayer}} has standing to sue {{if the state}} government is acting unconstitutionally with respect to public funds, or if government action is causing some special injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> that is not shared by taxpayers in general.

2500|$|Some {{supporters}} of mass transit believe {{that use of}} taxpayer capital to fund mass transit will ultimately save taxpayer money in other ways, and therefore, state-funded mass transit is a benefit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> Some research has supported this position, but the measurement of benefits and costs is a complex and controversial issue. A lack of mass transit results in more traffic, pollution, and road construction to accommodate more vehicles, all costly to taxpayers; providing mass transit will therefore alleviate these costs. (Perhaps, although right-wing think tanks disagree) ...|$|E
50|$|On February 13, 2015, {{the provincial}} {{government}} announced that {{the opening of the}} line would be delayed until late 2016, due to slower-than-expected tunnel boring process.

50|$|Taxpayers, however, {{will not}} likely shift <b>the</b> income <b>to</b> just any person, {{but may be}} willing to shift income to a close family member or friend.
