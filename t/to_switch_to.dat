5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> a new position some 10km away due to {{the ease with which}} the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E

After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.

5|$|In 2013, Mortimer applied <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands {{national}} team; {{since her}} mother is from that country, she has dual citizenship. In June 2014, the Hamilton Spectator reported the change.

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> cheaper oils such as palm or soybean.

By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> digital ink and paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} match, the Kerala Blasters {{made a couple}} {{necessary}} defensive changes from the squad that faced Chennaiyin in the semi-finals. David James replaced the injured Sandip Nandy in goal, while Saumik Dey and Nirmal Chettri replaced the suspended pair of Jamie McAllister and Gurwinder Singh {{in the middle of}} defense. Atlético de Kolkata head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, meanwhile decided to bench the team's marquee player, Luis García, and instead started Arnal in central midfield. Habas also decided <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> playing four defenders instead of three, which meant that Kingshuk Debnath started the match while Lester Fernandez moved to the bench.|$|E

Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league, making him a dual-code international. It is unlikely his switch to rugby league was done without Gallaher's knowledge. Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach.|$|E

Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.|$|E
