Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.|$|E
5|$|The active visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{in the form of}} flashing lights. These flash in order <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> other road users as the ambulance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped ambulance in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for ambulance warning beacons are blue, red, amber, and white (clear). However the colours may vary by country and sometimes by operator.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{also found}} {{work in a}} variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood {{survivor}} in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-16th century, Chiprovtsi began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Catholic {{officials}} from Rome. In 1565, {{the archbishop of}} Antivari (today Bar, Montenegro) Ambrosius arrived in the town as an apostolic visitor. In 1592–1595, the Bosnian Croat cleric Peter Solinat {{and a group of}} Franciscans established a Catholic mission in the town. In 1601, Solinat was appointed bishop of Sofia with his seat in Chiprovtsi by Pope Clement VIII. He chose to reside in Chiprovtsi because Sofia's Catholic population was limited to a handful of Ragusan merchant families.|$|E
5|$|Originally from Lagos, Owumi {{moved to}} Boston, Massachusetts as a child. He played {{football}} and basketball {{from an early age}} and at college level, but subsequently focused on basketball at the Community College of Rhode Island and was named a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) All-American. He played his final two seasons at Alcorn State. Immediately after college, Owumi failed <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and played his rookie season in France with AL Roche-la-Molière, with whom he was named most valuable player of the league.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealanders {{would follow}} {{in due course}} but in the meantime, General Sir Douglas Haig, the {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), called for diversionary actions <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the German High Command away from the Allied preparations for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme. To achieve this, the New Zealanders mounted several trench raids. By the time the New Zealand Division was relieved in August, it had incurred 2,500 casualties, including 375 dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare.

Thousands of Tamils gathered in front of the Peace Tower, subsequently drawing out a few politicians from inside, notably Bev Oda and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Layton announced that he would call parliament to an emergency debate at the House of Commons. Oda announced that the government would provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E

30|$|The TMA was {{developed}} for industrial societies and it is inadequate {{to meet the requirements}} of (environmental) risk societies (Shrivastava 1995). Increasing environmental risks began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> profit-oriented business approach and this trend provides further support to GMA in the managerial sense. Today, green management, which considers environmental issues, has become an accepted part of business life (Brown and Karagozlu 1998).|$|R
5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E

5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation {{that he had the}} ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E
5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, {{which is part of the}} teleius group.|$|E
5|$|Bruce began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> big-name {{clubs in}} late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all {{reported}} {{to be interested in}} signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|Animality is a {{condition}} in which one is governed by instinct, in which one has no sense of morality and lives only for the present moment.

5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E
