VN nanoparticles were in dimension of about 10 nm. N 2 absorption <b>result</b> <b>indicated</b> that the surface area of VN sample was 88 m 2 /g, and most pores were distributed {{in the range of}} 2 – 6 nm. The supercapacitive behavior of VN electrode in 1 mol/L KOH electrolyte was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge measurements. The results showed that mesoporous VN electrode had both electrical double-layer capacitive properties and redox pseudocapacitive properties. The specific capacitance was of VN electrode 517 F/g at 1 mV/s scan rate, when the scan rate was up to 10 mV/s, its specific capacitance maintained 275 F/g...|$|R
