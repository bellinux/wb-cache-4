5|$|The {{origins of}} the Challenge era come from the method of play of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada prior to 1893. From 1887 to 1893, the league did not play a {{round-robin}} format, but rather challenges between teams of the association that year, with {{the winner of the}} series being the 'interim' champion, with the final challenge winner becoming the league champion for the year. The Stanley Cup kept the tradition going, but added league championships as another way that a team could win the trophy. If a team in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> as the current champion won the league championship, it would then inherit the Cup, without a challenge. The only time this rule was not followed was in 1904, when the Ottawa Senators club withdrew from its league, the CAHL. The trustees ruled that the Cup stayed with Ottawa, instead of the CAHL league champion.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was {{declared}} the official {{emblem of the}} Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt {{the black and white}} colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies, and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.|$|E

50|$|Welsh {{professional}} club teams traditionally {{played in}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>leagues</b> as their English counterparts, structured into regional divisions. This often resulted in teams from North Wales and South Wales not {{facing each other}} as the transport links between the two regions were poor. In 1992 the Welsh Premier League was formed to create a national league. Six Welsh clubs who enjoyed success in the English leagues refused to join, but despite this the teams that come top of the Welsh Premier League have a greater chance of playing in European competition, as the top three clubs are drawn into the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.|$|R

Nelson continued to play in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> until 1982, when the side achieved a third-placed finish. In the same year, the non-league football system was re-organised, resulting {{in the formation of the}} North West Counties Football League.
