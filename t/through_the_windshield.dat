5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

25|$|In 1930 {{cars had}} {{dashboards}} of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against {{the interior of}} the automobile or <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.|$|E
25|$|On February 20, 1961, Garcia {{got into}} a car with Paul Speegle, a sixteen-year-old artist and {{acquaintance}} of Garcia; Lee Adams, the house manager of the Chateau and driver of the car; and Alan Trist, a companion of theirs. After speeding past the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, the car encountered a curve and, traveling around ninety miles per hour, collided with the guard rail, sending the car rolling turbulently. Garcia was hurled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> of the car into a nearby field with such force he was literally thrown out of his shoes and would later be unable to recall the ejection. Lee Adams, the driver, and Alan Trist, who was seated in the back, were thrown from the car as well, suffering from abdominal injuries and a spine fracture, respectively. Garcia escaped with a broken collarbone, while Speegle, still in the car, was fatally injured.|$|E
25|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 1–2, 1992, Mayor Daley and wife Maggie {{attended}} a family party in New York, and 16-year-old Patrick was to stay with relatives. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends and drove his father's new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night. Patrick fetched former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun from the Daley home {{and handed it to}} his cousin, R. J. Vanecko, 17. Vanecko aimed the shotgun at teenagers, pulled the trigger twice and yelled that he was not afraid to use the weapon. A youth threw a concrete goose lawn ornament <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> of Mayor Daley's truck, and Patrick punched him. A youth was seriously injured when struck {{in the head with a}} baseball bat wielded by a juvenile, was hospitalized in critical condition, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain and spent three days in intensive care.|$|E

25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the Model Z's crash during a speed run in December 1931 was due to an unexpected failure of the gasoline tank cap, which may have come loose and passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> A bullet-proof windscreen and internal fuel caps {{were part of the}} new design. Analysis of motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, is inconclusive. Control surface flutter is a more likely cause. It is theorized that the gas cap struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to uncontrolled flutter in the right aileron which imparted undue stress on that wing, causing it to pitch up sharply and fail. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed. The 1932 R-1 and its sister ship, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation, the Bulldogs {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling, {{and also to}} All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were hopeful that {{the return of the}} Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, {{the decision was made to}} split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989 Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his head <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> and being thrown 25 feet onto the pavement. He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} {{historically}} been considered a clone of Grand Theft Auto that later positioned itself as more [...] "gleefully silly" [...] in comparison. In combat, players select weapons from a weapon selection wheel, including regular pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and rocket launchers alongside special weapons such as UAV drones and a fart-in-a-jar stun grenade. Player melee attacks include running attacks such as DDTs and a purple dildo bat. Players may use vehicles to navigate the city, including a hover jet (known as the F-69 VTOL) and a pixelated retrogame tank that are unlocked through story missions. Once special vehicles are unlocked, they are in unlimited supply and can be delivered directly to the player-character's location. Player actions are intensified with what Volition calls the [...] "awesome button", where for example the player will divekick <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> into the driver's seat of a car.

40|$|In 1968 Robert Adams (* 1937) {{dedicated}} a small, {{relatively unknown}} group {{of work to}} a remote, entirely mundane place with a highly evocative name: Eden, Colorado, a small spot along the interstate 25, about forty miles south from Colorado Springs, consisting of {{little more than the}} Westland Truck Stop. With his photo book of the same name, the photographer elaborates many characteristics of his most famous The New West (1974) and his other work about the Colorado Front Range, popularly represented in the seminal exhibition New Topographics. Photographs of a Man-altered Landscape (George Eastman House, Rochester, N. Y., 1975). Virtually in nuce, Eden reveals Adams’s typical use of the square format as well as his mastery of the various artistic potentials of the photographic book. With his calm and silent images of Eden, Robert Adams positions himself literally crosswise to the countless contemporary views <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> and into <b>the</b> diners, celebrating speed, color and popular culture, at the same time denying notions of a frontier just sweeping across the manifold regions of the American West. Instead, he focuses on the identity of this particular place and the natural order of this once sublime landscape, reading its present-day appearance as a metaphor of the highly ambivalent "New West"...|$|R
500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red scrim lighting {{to reflect on the}} subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though there was nothing in particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> again.|$|E

Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
