5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm. Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living ex-Prime Minister. Stone previously painted portraits of <b>the</b> <b>Queen</b> <b>and</b> the Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
5|$|Boniface {{accompanied}} <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> Prince Edward to Burgos for {{the marriage}} of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward's knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258.|$|E
50|$|Leaf-cutter ants are {{relatively}} large, rusty red or brown in colour, {{and have a}} spiny body and long legs. The three main castes within a nest are <b>the</b> <b>queen,</b> worker <b>and</b> soldier. Only <b>the</b> <b>queens</b> <b>and</b> males have wings, and these ants are also known as 'reproductives' or 'swarmers'. Although most of the ants in the nest are female, only <b>the</b> <b>queens</b> produce eggs. Queens are usually over 20 mm long.|$|R
25|$|Around late summer, <b>the</b> <b>queens</b> <b>and</b> males {{leave their}} home colonies.

Upon arrival of spring season (around mid April or early May), <b>the</b> <b>queens</b> will emerge <b>and</b> feed {{with the goal}} of finding a new nest.|$|R

5|$|France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially {{declared}} Madagascar to {{be their}} colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. <b>The</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|Hector was {{assigned}} as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer {{during this period}} when <b>the</b> <b>Queen</b> <b>and</b> her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there until 1900 when she briefly {{became part of the}} HMS Vernon torpedo school as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless telegraphy installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> <b>and</b> Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived {{close to}} <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> <b>and</b> {{both she and}} Beatrice {{performed}} duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.|$|E

5|$|Hyde Park {{has been}} a major venue for several Royal jubilees and celebrations. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, a party was {{organised}} on 22 June where around 26,000 school children were given a free meal as a gift. <b>The</b> <b>Queen</b> <b>and</b> the Prince of Wales made an unexpected appearance at the event. Victoria remained fond of Hyde Park in the final years of her life and often drove there twice a day. As part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, a Jubilee Exhibition was set up in Hyde Park, with <b>the</b> <b>Queen</b> <b>and</b> Prince Philip visiting on 30 June. In 2012, a major festival took place in the park as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. On 6 February, the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun Royal Salute at Hyde Park Corner.|$|E

5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly.

Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E
