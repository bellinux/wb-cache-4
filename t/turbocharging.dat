25|$|The first {{production}} turbocharger diesel {{passenger car}} was the Garrett-turbocharged Mercedes 300SD introduced in 1978.

50|$|All Applications: Restricted to {{a single}} <b>turbocharger.</b> All air {{entering}} the <b>turbocharger</b> must pass through the <b>turbocharger</b> inlet.

25|$|Having had {{previous}} {{success with}} <b>turbocharging</b> Fiat Spiders, DeLorean {{entered into a}} contract with Legend Industries, based in Hauppauge, New York. DMC wanted to increase power without sacrificing fuel economy. DMC wanted a wide power band {{and did not want}} a surge of power similar to the Porsche 930 Turbo. Legend used twin IHI RHB52 turbos along with twin intercoolers. The results were an engine capable of accelerating smoothly in fifth gear from 1,500rpm to full turbo boost at 2,500rpm reaching 150mph at 6,500rpm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true <b>turbocharging.</b> This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E

The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E

The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America, being sold under Nissan's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37.|$|E

25|$|Turbochargers {{are also}} {{employed}} in certain two-stroke cycle diesel engines, which would normally require a Roots blower for aspiration. In this specific application, mainly Electro-Motive diesel (EMD) 567, 645, and 710 Series engines, the turbocharger is initially {{driven by the}} engine's crankshaft through a gear train and an overrunning clutch, thereby providing aspiration for combustion. After combustion has been achieved, and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy, the overrunning clutch is automatically disengaged, and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases. In the EMD application, the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true <b>turbocharging</b> during medium and high power output settings. This is particularly beneficial at high altitudes, as are often encountered on western U.S. railroads. It is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power.|$|E

25|$|Land Rover's global sales {{collapsed}} {{during the}} early 1980s. This was mainly due to foreign competition offering larger, more powerful, more comfortable vehicles. Land Rover suffered from poor build quality and materials during the 1970s and by 1983 the then-current Series III model was distinctly outdated, despite recent improvements. Land Rover decided to focus the sales of its Ninety/One Ten/127 range on the UK and Europe, for which it required a diesel engine with significantly better performance than the 68-horsepower 2.5-litre type then in production. Project Falcon was started in 1984 to develop a turbocharged version of this engine. The resulting engine was Land Rover's first production turbodiesel and their first engine {{to be given a}} marketing name- the Diesel Turbo, a name given to differentiate it from the VM Motori-built turbodiesel then being used in the Range Rover, which was sold as the 'Turbo D'. The Diesel Turbo, although essentially the same as the 2.5-litre diesel, had numerous additions and modifications to allow it to cope with the stresses of <b>turbocharging.</b> New pistons with Teflon-coated crowns and Nimonic steel exhaust valves were used to withstand higher combustion temperatures. The crankshaft was cross-drilled for improved strength and cooling. The block was modified to allow an oil feed/drain system to the turbocharger, and the cooling system was improved with an 8-bladed viscous fan and integral oil cooler. The engine was fitted with a high-capacity breather system to cope with the greater volumes of gas flow through the engine. Despite the inherent age of the design, it performed well in tests against its rivals and provided the vital blend of performance and economy the Land Rover had needed for many years. It was the first diesel model to match the petrol engine's 4-ton towing limit and the first to be able to exceed the UK national speed limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, early engines suffered several failures. Most serious were failed main and big-end bearings and splits or cracks in the block. In 1988 a new block and an improved design of bearing and bearing cap was fitted which solved these issues. The engine's higher internal temperatures meant that the cooling system also had to be maintained to a much higher standard than the earlier engines. Further changes were made in 1989, this time to the breather system to prevent oil being drawn into the air filter. Despite these issues, the Diesel Turbo was a strong seller. It was the standard engine for the UK and European markets and Land Rover's sales increased after its introduction. Time has shown that these engines can turn in long service lives if maintained as required—like many early turbodiesels, a lack of maintenance causes failure.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{technology}} of <b>turbocharger</b> {{has been used}} with internal combustion engines since 1905 to increase intake air pressure prior to putting it into the cylinders to increase thermal efficiency of the engine. Based on previous researches and uses of turbochargers, the pattern of <b>turbocharger</b> installation remains the same, either in series or in parallel. Therefore, this research aims to study installation of the combined <b>turbocharger.</b> The combined <b>turbocharger</b> set comprised two turbochargers {{of the same size}} having exhaust turbine connected in parallel to let both turbochargers work simultaneously and having intake air compressor connected in series for two stage compress. Approach: This research aimed to study the thermal efficiency of a combined <b>turbocharger</b> set with gasoline engine. The study was done by comparing the thermal efficiency between the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set and the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set. The variation of both temperature and pressure of the intake air and exhaust gas were also investigated. The engine used in the study was TOYOTA engine model 1 JZ-GTE with six cylinders and a total displacement volume of 2, 491 cc. The engine was already installed with parallel <b>turbocharger</b> from the factory, therefore, the thermal efficiency test of the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> case was conducted first. Then, the engine was modified to be a combined <b>turbocharger</b> set and tested by the same procedure. The test was run under the speed of 2, 000 - 5, 000 rpm. Results: According to the test, the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set gave higher thermal efficiency than the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set in all range of speed. At the speed of 2, 500, 3, 000, 3, 500, 4, 000, 4, 500 and 5, 000 rpm, the thermal efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set was equal to 39. 37, 57. 73, 79. 30, 67. 66, 60. 63 and 55. 05 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the thermal efficiency of the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set was equal to 15. 40, 22. 61, 44. 96, 55. 21, 56. 38 and 52. 24 %, respectively. Conclusion: It could be seen that the thermal efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set was higher than that of the parallel set by 2. 55 times at the speed range of 2, 500 - 3, 000 rpm. The efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> would be equal or higher than that of the parallel set by 1. 05 times at the speed of 5, 000 rpm...|$|R
