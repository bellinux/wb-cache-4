40|$|Introduction. <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is {{a multidimensional}} concept, which is best {{expressed}} by the subjective well-being. Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is <b>the</b> basis for measuring the well-being, and the determination of factors that determine <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>quality</b> is <b>the</b> basis for its improvement Objective. To evaluate and assess the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> group distinguishing features which characterize demographic and socioeconomic factors. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of {{a representative sample of}} the population in Serbia aged over 20 years (9479 examinees). <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was {{expressed by the}} perception of well-being (pleasure <b>of</b> <b>life).</b> Data on the examinees (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics) were collected by using a questionnaire for adults of each household. To process, analyze and present the data, we used the methods of parametric descriptive statistics (mean value, standard deviation, coefficient of variation), variance analysis and factor analysis. Results. Although men evaluated <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with a slightly higher grading, there was no statistically significant difference in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in relation to the examinee’s gender (p> 0. 005). Among the examinees there was a high statistically significant difference in grading <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> depending on age, level of education, marital status and type of job (p 0. 005).
