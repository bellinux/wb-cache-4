25|$|This triage is {{performed}} by a physician called médecin <b>trieur</b> (sorting medic). This triage is usually performed at the field hospital (PMA–poste médical avancé, i.e. forward medical post). The absolute urgencies are usually treated onsite (the PMA has an operating room) or evacuated to a hospital. The relative urgencies are just placed under watch, waiting for an evacuation. The involved are addressed to another structure called the CUMP–Cellule d'urgence médico-psychologique (medical-psychological urgency cell); this is a resting zone, with food and possibly temporary lodging, and a psychologist {{to take care of}} the brief reactive psychosis and avoid post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

Their aim is to produce their own films as well as to host other international projects.In the last seven years, several short films and features (Skimkent Hotel, Charles de Meaux’s Le Pont de <b>Trieur,</b> Dominique Gonzalez-Foester’s Riyo and Central Plage...), which were shown in cinemas and broadcast on television, have been produced. Some of them have been brought out on DVD in the Anna Sanders Films MK2 collection. During the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Tropical Malady obtained the Prix du Jury, and in 2002 Blissfully Yours by the same director obtained the award Un Certain regard.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Over-triage and access-block are {{worldwide}} phenomena which critically compromise {{patient care}} and increase morbidity and mortality. Triage {{is designed to}} place the patient {{in the right place}} at the right time with the right resources. We sought to determine and evaluate the application reliability of the South African Triage Score/Scale (SATS) in adult emergency cases presenting to a central academic hospital and to identify which factors may have influenced this. Methods: Emergency department (ED) triage data for adult patients at a central academic hospital in Johannesburg over a seven day period were captured retrospectively. The investigator applied the SATS  2008 to each triage form. Triage scores and colour banding for the <b>trieur</b> versus the investigator were compared and the overall degree of triage concordance and discordance observed. Results: A total sample size of 1758 cases was recorded. Moderate agreement (quadratically weighted  0. 524 at 95...|$|E
40|$|Normal 0 21 false false false PT-BR X-NONE X-NONE This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of parboiling on the yield of upland rice cultivars harvested at different times. The cultivars were BRS Primavera and BRS Sertaneja, harvested at 30 and 47 days after flowering (DAF). For parboiling, samples were soaked in water bath at 65 °C in grain: water ratio of 1 : 1. 6 {{in order to reach}} 25 % and 30 % moisture, and then were autoclaved for 10 minutes at 120 °C and 1. 1 kg/cm 2 of pressure. After drying up to 13 % moisture in a greenhouse with forced air at 40 °C, samples were benefited, followed by separation using the <b>trieur</b> equipment and weighing to obtain the head rice yield. The results showed a higher yield for head rice harvested at 30 DAF than at 47 DAF (BRS Primavera 63. 2 and 38. 7 %; BRS Sertaneja 68. 5 and 55. 7 %, respectively). Parboiling increased the head rice yield, regardless of harvest season, but partly reflected the potential of the cultivar origin: BRS Primavera 70. 06 %, BRS Sertaneja 74. 94 %. It is concluded that the harvest season is one of the factors that most influence the quality of industrial rice and the effect of parboiling also depends on the potential of the material source. <!
