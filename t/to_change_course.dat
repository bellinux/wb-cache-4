5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified {{and was not}} considered a {{tropical storm}} until research by José Fernández-Partagás in 1997. The storm {{is believed to have}} originated west of the Canary Islands in the northeastern Atlantic on September 22. The tropical storm moved west-southwestward for several days, maintaining its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm began to curve early on September 26 and traveled directly westward before curving northward during the afternoon. The tropical storm continued <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course,</b> turning west-northwestward by September 28. The transitioned to an extratropical system on October 1, and reached England on October 3.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E

25|$|The {{detached}} U-boats {{were designated}} wolfpack 'Leopard', but were soon ordered <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> {{to close a}} larger convoy spotted by wolfpack 'Wolf' about 400 miles to the west. At 05:00 on 12 October, U-353 spotted an independently sailing merchant ship of 4,000 to 5,000 tons, and closed to attack, firing two torpedoes {{from a range of}} 2,000 yards. The ship promptly altered course, and the U-boat fired another torpedo from her stern tube. Two loud explosions were heard, and the ship was seen to break in two and sink. U-353 surfaced and closed at full speed, only to find U-133 already there and claiming the victory. Eventually the two captains agreed that U-353s torpedoes had forced the ship <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> into U-133s line of fire, and they agreed to share the credit. Ten minutes later another U-boat was sighted, , which claimed to have sunk two ships. The U-boats then parted company to search for the convoy.|$|E
25|$|Particularly at Cape Fear's outlet to the Atlantic, {{the area}} was {{enclosed}} by a half dozen Confederate positions. The river flowed to the sea through two relatively shallow inlets, which were partitioned by Smith Island now Bald Head Island. The existence of two inlets resulted in a crucial advantage: guided by the Confederates, the blockade runners were capable of avoiding the Union ships. They simply had <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> unexpectedly, alternatively between the two inlets.|$|E

25|$|The Noga, {{disguised}} as a merchant ship, was fitted with electronic surveillance equipment and satellite communications gear in its superstructure, and was primarily used to intercept communications traffic in Arab ports. As the ship was heading from Antalya in Turkey back to Haifa, the captain was instructed in an encrypted message <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> for Italy and anchor off the coast. The Noga arrived off the Italian port city of La Spezia and anchored in international waters, just outside Italian territorial waters.|$|E

Two armed men, Dardo Cabo, 25, and Alejandro Giovenco, entered the flight deck and ordered Commander Ernesto Fernandez Garcia <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> toward the Falklands. Two of the men approached Guzmán in the cabin and told him of the hijacking, and one of his aides-de-camp attempted to get his pistol, but he was struck down.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course,</b> creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E

After takeoff, however, they reveal themselves to be possessed by Aurans. They ask Wes, the last survivor, to join them. Wes refuses and tries to sabotage the Meteor Rejector, but fatally electrocutes himself while doing so.

25|$|After {{traveling}} {{east for}} , SH-38 {{is forced to}} {{turn back to the}} north by Kegelman Air Force Auxiliary Field, a secondary airfield of Vance Air Force Base. As the highway continues north, it forms the boundary between Kegelman AFAF to the east and the Great Salt Plains State Park to the west. Upon crossing the Salt Fork Arkansas River, the road turns back to the west, entering the park. Within the park boundaries, SH-38 is again forced <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> by the Great Salt Plains Lake, and turns back to a due north heading. One mile (1.6km) north of the turn, the highway passes through the unincorporated place of Vining. SH-38 continues north, coming to an end at SH-11.|$|E

He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named Bougainville Island for himself.

25|$|Early rockets {{were very}} inaccurate. Without {{the use of}} {{spinning}} or any controlling feedback loop, rockets had a strong tendency to veer sharply off of their intended course. The early Mysorean rockets and their successor British Congreve rockets reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick {{to the end of}} a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to make it harder for the rocket <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course.</b> The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30 am Brisk, under Captain Algernon de Horsey, {{bearing the}} flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir Henry Keppel, K. C. B., was running to the northward in the Mozambique Channel when she sighted a ship in the haze with many sails set, which {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course</b> as if attempting to avoid contact. Brisk made sail and steam, and reached a speed of 11 1/2 knots as she pursued Emanuela. Even so, {{it was at least}} four hours later before she could draw close enough to fire a shot across Emanuelas bow, board her, and take the slaver captain and officers into custody. Brisk then put into Pomoni in possession of Manuela to make arrangements to replace the slaver crew with a prize crew.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 1492, off {{the coast}} of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>course.</b> He {{probably}} sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he should have had a pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.|$|E
