25|$|The {{issue of}} section 41 had been considered, but not resolved, by the High Court {{in the earlier}} case of King v Jones (that case was decided on a {{different}} basis, and it was unnecessary to reach a definite answer to this question). The four people argued that the obiter dicta in that case supported their interpretation of section 41, {{that it was a}} guarantee rather than a <b>transitional</b> <b>provision.</b>|$|E
25|$|The six {{majority}} judges {{decided that}} section 41 {{was indeed a}} <b>transitional</b> <b>provision,</b> which only operated as a restraint on the first law that the Parliament of Australia passed concerning the federal franchise, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902. That is, section 41 only protected rights which were in existence before the Franchise Act was passed. No new rights protectable by section 41 could be acquired after that time. Because the four people in this case did not acquire their right to vote in state elections until well after 1902, section 41 did not give them a right to vote in federal elections.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} other main {{potential}} interpretations of section 41, {{both of which}} suggested that the section was only ever {{intended to be a}} <b>transitional</b> <b>provision,</b> to preserve the status quo until the Parliament of Australia could pass its own laws about elections and voting. The first interpretation was that section 41 only applied to people who were already entitled to vote when the Constitution of Australia came into effect, an argument first advanced by William Harrison Moore. The second argument was that it could apply to people who acquired a right after the Constitution came into effect, but only if they acquired that right {{on the basis of a}} state law which was in force before the Constitution came into effect, an argument put forward by John Quick and Robert Garran. The four people argued that neither of these interpretations should apply, because section 41 was not a <b>transitional</b> <b>provision.</b> They argued that if it were, it would have been worded like other transitional provisions, including the usual phrase [...] "until Parliament otherwise provides".|$|E

2500|$|The Commonwealth electoral officers, {{who were}} {{represented}} by the Solicitor-General of Australia Sir Maurice Byers, and William Gummow (a future Justice of the High Court), argued that section 41 was indeed {{intended to be a}} <b>transitional</b> <b>provision.</b> They linked it with section 8 and section 30 of the Australian Constitution, which provide that until the federal parliament made laws on the matter, the qualification of electors for the Senate (section 8) and the House of Representatives (section 30) would be determined by state laws. Sir Maurice said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Murphy also {{referred}} {{to the history of}} section 41 in the Convention Debates, in particular the records of 3 March 1898, where Edmund Barton proposed that the clause which would become section 41 should explicitly apply only to electors who had the right to vote at state level [...] "at the establishment of the Commonwealth or afterwards [...] under the law in force in any state at the establishment of the Commonwealth." [...] But Barton faced opposition. Alexander Peacock expressed concern that if Victoria followed South Australia in granting women's suffrage, but did so after Federation, then Barton's clause would not protect their rights federally. The President of the Convention, Charles Kingston, was also sceptical. Frederick Holder said that [...] "If the clause is altered as our leader wishes it to be altered, the right of the state Parliaments to expand the franchise would cease on the establishment of the Commonwealth, and the federal action in reference to the franchise might not be taken for some years." [...] Barton's proposal was defeated, and the broader wording remained, and so in Murphy's view, the history of section 41 demanded that it not be regarded as a <b>transitional</b> <b>provision.</b>|$|E
