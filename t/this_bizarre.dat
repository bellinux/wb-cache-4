Mulder, wishing to speak to Crump, follows the ambulance, and ends up being kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police.|$|E

25|$|The {{court is}} {{informed}} that the plaintiff in error {{is no longer in}} the service of the state. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E

25|$|After the Meetings {{were closed}} in 1903, Gippius tried to revive her initial {{idea in the}} form of what was {{regarded}} as her 'domestic Church', based on the controversial Troyebratstvo (Brotherhood of Three), composed of herself, Merezhkovsky, and Dmitry Filosofov, their mutual close friend and, for a short while, her lover. This new development outraged many of their friends, like Nikolai Berdyaev who saw <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> parody on the Trinity, with its own set of quasi-religious rituals, as profanation bordering on blasphemy.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>bizarre</b> {{method of}} {{insemination}} probably evolved as male bed bugs competed {{with each other}} to place their sperm {{closer and closer to the}} mother lode of eggs, the ovaries. Some male insects evolved long penises with which they enter the vagina but bypass the female's storage pouch and deposit their sperm further upstream close to the ovaries. A few males, notably among bed bugs, evolved traumatic insemination instead, and eventually this strange procedure became the norm among these insects.|$|E
25|$|The band {{performed}} five {{dates in}} Japan {{at the beginning}} of September and then embarked on what was dubbed the 'Troublemaker' tour, consisting of 21 dates around North America, including two in Canada. Angels and Airwaves and Tokyo Police Club joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell's 'other' band The Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform Island in the Sun and Beverly Hills with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, 'My Brain', dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. <b>This</b> <b>bizarre</b> event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo's second demo album, Alone 2.|$|E

500|$|<b>This</b> <b>bizarre</b> command {{structure}} {{went against the}} grain of the Air Force's single air manager concept, which dictated that one commander was to control and coordinate all aircraft within a combat theater. The chain through which operational strike requests had to flow gave some indication of the growing overcomplexity of the campaign. Requests for airstrikes originated with the 2nd Air Division and Task Force 77 in Vietnam and then proceeded to CINCPAC, who in turn reported to his superiors, the Joint Chiefs, at the Pentagon. After input from the State Department and the CIA, the requests then proceeded to the White House, where the president and his [...] "Tuesday Cabinet" [...] made decisions on the strike requests on a weekly basis.|$|E

500|$|Cate Blanchett plays Soviet agent Irina Spalko. Screenwriter David Koepp {{created the}} character. Frank Marshall said Spalko {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} Indiana having a love-hate relationship [...] "with every woman he ever comes in contact with." [...] Blanchett had wanted to play a villain for a [...] "couple of years", and enjoyed {{being part of the}} Indiana Jones legacy. Spielberg praised Blanchett as a [...] "master of disguise", and considers her his favorite Indiana Jones villain for inventing much of Spalko's character. Spalko's bob cut was her idea, with the character's stern looks and behaviour recalling Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love. Blanchett learned to fence for the character; but during filming, Spielberg decided to give Spalko [...] "karate chop" [...] skills. LaBeouf recalled Blanchett was elusive on set, and Ford was surprised when he met her on set out of costume. He noted, [...] "There's no aspect of her behavior that was not consistent with <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> person she's playing." ...|$|E
500|$|On 23 October 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS 60 Minutes to {{film the}} reenactment. Doriel told the correspondent, Bob Simon, that he {{believed}} the boy's death was real, but {{that it had been}} set up to damage Israel. Those in the know, he said, included the cameraman and the boy's father, though the latter had not realized the boy would be killed. When General Samia heard about the interview, he removed Doriel from the investigation. The investigators' report was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence; the key points were published in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as [...] "quite plausible" [...] that he had been hit by Palestinian bullets aimed at the IDF post. The inquiry provoked widespread criticism. A Haaretz editorial said, [...] "it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> investigation." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E

500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E
2500|$|A year later, the Tennessee Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the Dayton court on a procedural technicality—not on constitutional grounds, as Darrow had hoped. According to the court, the fine should have been set by the jury, not Raulston. Rather than send the case back for further action, however, the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the case. The court commented, [...] "Nothing is to be gained by prolonging the life of <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> case." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reference}} {{points for the}} lyrics of The Scream were J. G. Ballard and William Burroughs. In a track such as [...] "Suburban Relapse", the band wrote about suburbia, where they were born and raised. Steven Severin emphasized: [...] "That's why J.G. Ballard resonated so much with us, because all his near-future tales were set in <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> suburban wasteland. Suburbia {{is a place where}} you can imagine any kind of possibility, because there's space, not urban clutter".|$|E
50|$|The House of Guitars has {{employed}} a non-traditional approach to commercial sales.

Ratings shot through the roof, providing an encouraging sign to the other 100 PBS stations that had signed up to begin airing the show in October 1974—exactly five years after their BBC debut. [...] There was also cross-promotion from FM Radio stations across the country, whose airing of tracks from the Python LPs had already introduced American audiences to <b>this</b> <b>bizarre</b> brand of comedy.

2500|$|The Times of London {{commented that}} {{although}} Ballinger's videos have gained her character notice, it [...] "is not online but on stage that Miranda truly comes to ghastly life."

A 2013 reviewer concurred: [...] "nly a truly talented performer {{could make the}} Miranda character believable, let alone as endearing as she ends up being." [...] AussieTheatre.com stated that Ballinger [...] "creates the most successful parody {{of the world of}} YouTube ... she has created an international cult following". As the popularity of the character increased, Ballinger was able to book longer runs of her live Miranda act, at larger and larger venues, including the Best Buy Theater in New York City and, among many others, London's Cadogan Hall.|$|E
