50|$|The Aro-Orji Village as is popularly called is the {{smallest}} of the nine villages that make up Orji Autonomous Community.

Some other Nwosu and Okoroafor family members live in Umundula village. This situation is occasioned by the size of land which they occupy and as the families expand, they have need to seek new settlements to accommodate other family members. The Aros have a very strong culture and celebrate Aro Day annually on December 26 unless otherwise agreed by the Aro Family Meeting which comprises all the married adult males in the village. For the very first time in the history of Orji, the Aro Village came out tops and lifted the annual Orji Unity Football Cup trophy for 2014. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that hardly fields 11 players owing to their size.|$|E

I don’t have, unfortunately, four defenders on my level that can help me out."; [...] "Tim is still a young player with a lot to learn. He still has quite a lot to learn, and well, he has committed errors that are very infantile and cost us goals."; and [...] "I think that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> game, and unfortunately, there isn’t an equal level between perhaps (Thierry Henry) and myself, and our teammates." [...] Despite Marquez's initial claims that he was misquoted, the interview was videotaped and posted in its entirety at a fan website. Two days later the club suspended Marquez for one match.|$|E

5000|$|There are six main {{groups of}} {{attendees}} at conference. The largest group by far are the delegates. Delegates are students who usually have not attended a Provincial Conference before (although {{they may have}} attended one or more Regional Conference(s)). These are the students who are usually not very familiar with the NSSSA, who are attending for the first time, or {{do not have a}} position of higher responsibility. The delegates are divided into groups of about 8 to 10, known as skillbuilding groups. In charge of the skillbuilding groups are the second group of attendees, the skillbuilders. Skillbuilders are students who have been to at least one Provincial Conference in a previous year, are familiar with the organization, and wish to take on a position of responsibility. The skillbuilders are the leaders in skillbuilding sessions, where the entire skillbuilding group meets by themselves and does activities with the intent of building self-esteem, leadership skills, and knowledge of self. Members of PC, CC, and Regional Cabinets are often skillbuilders as well during the actual period of conference. The skillbuilders are led by two Skillbuilding Co-Chairs who are members of Conference Committee. Another group of attendees are the advisors, who are teachers who are responsible for the students from their school. Advisors also attend sessions similar to skillbuilding sessions. The next group are the Logistics team. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of usually 10-20 former members who have graduated from secondary school, but are too young to be a chaperone. The Logistics team shows up on the Tuesday before conference and are tasked with assisting Conference Committee (who also arrive on Tuesday) as CC gets everything ready and set up for the beginning of conference. During conference, the Logistics team assists anyone with questions they may have, particularly pertaining to where activities are, or where a skillbuilding group meeting area is. Logistics also takes attendance during all skillbuilding sessions to make sure that delegates have not gone missing without good reason to do so. The Logistics team is led by two Heads of Logistics who are also members of Conference Committee. There are also the Chaperones, also known as Chaps. Chaps are former members of the organization who are aged 19 or older and are still wanting to have some involvement with the NSSSA. Chaps enforce the [...] "3D's" [...] (see below) and other rules of conference, as well as ensure the safety of everyone attending. The primary duties of Chaps, aside from enforcing the rules, are to stay up at night in the university residences to make sure that everyone is safe, and that nobody leaves the residence without an escort after dark. These escorts are known as s, and their job is to shuttle delegates and skillbuilders (and off-duty Logistics members) from place to place, {{and to make sure that}} everyone arrives to their stated destination safely and promptly. Chaps sometimes do not take part in the daily activities of conference due to their being awake all night (and thus sleeping most of the daylight hours). The Chaps are led by two Head Chaperones, who make up the schedules and determine where the Chaps will be stationed, and act as a headquarters for Chaps as needed. The final group of conference attendees is the First Aid team, which is led by a Head of First Aid (an experienced person working in medicine as a paramedic, physician, nurse, etc.). The First Aid team is responsible for providing medical assistance as needed, and to help the Chaps ensure the safety of everyone at conference. All First Aid team members are fully trained in First Aid and CPR. In addition to these major groups of attendees, there are always some people who do not act in any capacity previously mentioned. These include the Provincial Advisor (who is not attached to a particular school, and leads the advisors in their sessions), a (usually) three-person DJ crew from 101.3FM The Bounce (though originally the DJs were from Sights and Sounds Entertainment) who provides music for meals, the dance, and corporate fair, and special guests such as motivational speakers and university liaisons, as well as the annual talent show.|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{components}} that are essential to the operation of a clinical FES service. Firstly we believe that FES is part of a treatment package and cannot be delivered by the simple provision of a stand alone device enabling the patient to treat their own stroke, MS etc. Therefore trained staff are required to deliver that service and in our experience this works best if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of therapists and clinical engineers working closely together. Secondly the equipment has to be designed and manufactured to withstand the rigours of everyday life and reliability is essential. Constant patient support and education are also required and the problems that inevitably arise must be solved promptly. Patient selection is crucial. Finally data must be recorded and stored in a structured way (in Salisbury we have 1104 patients on the database and see 30 patients per week) to quantify the efficacy of treatment and to determine the design criteria {{for the next generation of}} devices. <br/...|$|E

40|$|We {{intend to}} study multiagent {{learning}} in stochastic games {{by developing a}} multiagent system for the game of keepout, and studying the effects of cooperation in the performance. We would study if in case of multiple agents, cooperating agents perform better that independent agents. We would vary the ways of cooperation and study its effects. We would like to infer if bearing the costs of cooperation pays off by better performance. In this report we present the developments uptil now and the future work we intend to do. 1 Problem Statement We shall deal with the stochastic game of KeepOut in multiagent setting. In KeepOut there are two teams (attackers and defenders). Any one of the attackers have to reach in a target area, which is a circle in {{the centre of the}} arena, and the defenders have to prevent the attackers from doing so. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> game where a team can also have one or more agents. It would be interesting to study the effects of cooperation in the performance of the teams. We would study the performance under varying ways of cooperation suggested by Tan [3]: • communicating instantaneous information such as actions or rewards • communicating episodes experienced by agents • communicate learned decision policies Figure 1 : Arena setup for the problem statement.
