25|$|An -tall Modern Gothic {{exhibition}} cabinet {{now at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art {{is attributed}} to Pabst, and was once attributed also to Furness. It features cameo-carved doors in maple and walnut, painted glass panels backed with foil, a shingled-roof top, and ornate brass hardware. This <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> piece is reminiscent of Furness's bank buildings of the late-1870s, although recent scholarship discounts Furness's participation in its design.|$|E
25|$|Talmadge's {{first film}} for her studio, the now lost Panthea, (1917) was {{directed}} by Allan Dwan with assistants Erich von Stroheim and Arthur Rosson. The film was a dramatic <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> for her in a story set in Russia {{of a woman who}} sacrifices herself to help her husband. The film was a hit, turning Talmadge into a sensation and established her as a first-rate dramatic actress.|$|E
6000|$|Elsley looked down. There were {{fifteen feet}} of {{somewhat}} slippery rock; then a ragged ledge a foot broad, in a crack {{of which the}} flower grew; then the dark boiling pool. Elsley shrugged his shoulders, and said, smiling, {{as if it were}} a fine thing to say--"Really, my dear, all men are not knight errants enough to endanger their necks for a bit of weed; and I cannot say that such rough <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> are at all to my fancy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Remarking {{upon the}} Liberal counterpart's {{performance}} in the chamber he sensed that Gladstone's <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> are perfectly natural. When after one of his great speeches he resumes his seat, he is, and often proves himself to be, ready to start again. With the Premier, {{the excitement of the}} moment over and the appointed task achieved, he falls into a state of prostration painful to witness. His eyes seem to lose all expression, his cheeks fall in, and his face takes on a ghastly hue. Physically he is at least ten years older than Gladstone.|$|R
50|$|Often {{power for}} the device is stored within it, via a winding device that applies {{mechanical}} stress to an energy-storage mechanism such as a mainspring, thus involving some form of escapement; in other cases, hand power may be utilized. The use of wheels, whether linked by friction or gear teeth, to redirect motion or gain speed or torque, is typical; many clockworks have been constructed primarily to serve as visible or implicit <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> of mechanical ingenuity in this area. Sometimes clocks and timing mechanisms are used to set off explosives, timers, alarms and many other devices.|$|R

When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute.

25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the rarest}} {{items in the}} {{collection}} is the 58cm high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is a <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> of bronze casting. Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint's martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on {{the tail of a}} parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet. Both masts have main and top-sails, and battlemented fighting-tops are made from gold. These items are displayed in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries.|$|E

He does eventually settle down, however, to play sweet and smooth on [...] "Too Late Now" [...] and [...] "Misty," [...] each of which features Pass' unmistakable combination of smooth single-note lines and silken chordal passages....Another look back at a brilliant performance from one of jazz's most unforgettable players." ...|$|R
5000|$|Baker {{was first}} heard on record in a British public jam session in 1941 and quickly {{established}} a strong reputation in London clubs. He was brass band trained and had faultless technical command. The young Baker was lead trumpeter with Ted Heath's post war orchestra with such <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> as [...] "Bakerloo Non-Stop" [...] recorded for the Decca record label in 1946 and still well remembered with a tenor saxophone solo from [...] "Johnny Gray", the piece becomes an exciting feature for both Baker and drummer Jack Parnell. In the 1950s Kenny led his own group called Baker's Dozen {{for which he}} played lead and solos and wrote the library. With this group he performed on the first regular jazz show on British radio, the BBC Light Programme series Let's Settle For Music.|$|R
5000|$|A {{review by}} then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams for The Guardian {{describes}} {{the book as}} beginning [...] "with what {{turns out to be}} one of many <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> in summarising the intellectual and social background of Christianity in the classical as well as the Jewish world, so that we can see something of the issues to which the Christian faith offered a startlingly new response.... MacCulloch shows an extraordinary familiarity with specialist literature in practically every area." [...] The book is [...] "a landmark in its field, astonishing in its range, compulsively readable, full of insight even for the most jaded professional and of illumination for the interested general reader. It will have few if any, rivals in the English language" [...] and provides [...] "crucial testimony to the resilience of the Christian community in a remarkable diversity of social settings." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{wondered}} who the deuce [...] "Sarah Soothings" [...] could be, but afterward learned {{this was the}} nom-de-guerre of a female contributor to the magazines, who, I dare say, silly as she might be, was never silly enough to record the sentiments Opportunity had just professed to repeat. As for The la Charité, and The la Vertue, they did {{not in the least}} surprise me; for Martha, the hussy, often made herself merry by recording that young lady's <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> in French. On one occasion I remember she wrote me, that when Opportunity wished to say, On est venu me chercher, instead of saying [...] "I am come for," [...] in homely English, which would have been the best of all, she had flown off in the high flight of [...] "Je suis venue pour." ...|$|R
5000|$|This metre, which {{from its}} {{popularity}} must be termed the [...] "hexameter of the Irish", is named Deibhidhe (D'yevvee), and well {{shows in the}} last two lines the internal rhyme to which we refer. If it be maintained, as Thurneysen maintains, that the Irish derived their rhyming verses from the Latins, it seems necessary to account for the peculiar forms that so much of this verse assumed in Irish, for the merest glance will show that the earliest Irish verse is full of <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force,</b> like this aird-runn, which cannot have been derived from Latin. After the 7th century the Irish brought their rhyming system to a pitch of perfection undreamt of by any nation in Europe, even at the present day, and it is no exaggeration to say that perhaps by no people was poetry so cultivated and, better still, so remunerated as in Ireland.|$|R

500|$|The {{cultural}} historian Panikos Panayi {{describes the}} book as a <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force,</b> seminal, and richly illustrated; and he notes that Food in England is partly a recipe book, partly a history. He contrasts it favourably with Philip Harben's Traditional Dishes of Britain, published a year earlier, which he criticises as accepting the [...] "stereotypical stalwarts of British food", whereas Hartley rightly accepts (Panayi quotes) that [...] "foreign dishes ... like the foreigners, become 'naturalised English'".|$|E
500|$|In late 1890 at a friend's {{house on}} Lake George in upstate New York, while {{recovering}} from a near-fatal case of jungle fever contracted in Honduras, Savage wrote a tale loosely based on his life, entitled My Official Wife.

This cross-departmental research collaboration between the curator of textiles and the curator of Oceanic art expands our understanding of these multi-dimensional Oceanic textile masterpieces. In our jointly presented paper, we will discuss both the means of construction and the religious/cultural significance of a selection of works from the Jolika Collection of New Guinea art...|$|R

60|$|Eve was {{perfectly}} mute with astonishment, notwithstanding the proofs she had often seen {{of the wide}} range that the ambition of an American of a certain class allows itself. Of course, she remembered the conversation on the Point, {{and it would not}} have been in nature, had not a mistress who had been so lately wooed, felt some surprise at finding her discarded suitor so soon seeking consolation in the smiles of her own maid.

50|$|Marvell's long poem on the beauties of Nunappleton, Upon Appleton House, comes {{nearer to}} the type. But {{it is hardly}} until the 18th century that in English {{literature}} appears what is properly known as descriptive poetry. This was the age in which poets, often of no mean capacity, began to take such definite themes as a small country estate (Pomfrets Choice, 1700), the cultivation of the grape (Gays Wine, 1708), a landscape (Popes Windsor Forest, 1713), a military manoeuvre (Addisons Campaign, 1704), the industry of an apple orchard (Philips Cyder, 1708) {{or a piece of}} topography (Tickells Kensington Gardens, 1722) as the sole subject of a lengthy poem, generally written in heroic or blank verse. These <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> were supported by minute efforts in miniature-painting, by touch applied to touch and were often monuments of industry, but they were apt to lack personal interest and suffered from a general and deplorable frigidity. They were infected with the faults that accompany an artificial style. They were monotonous, rhetorical, and symmetrical, while the uniformity of treatment inevitable to their plan rendered them hopelessly tedious if prolonged to any great extent.|$|R

He also attended weekly meetings of the University's Philosophical Society he founded (around 1940) and which counted Wittgenstein as chief amongst those eminent philosophers who addressed it in the years when Rhees was a lecturer at Swansea (retiring in 1966). It was also a forum in which students were expected to test and sharpen their philosophical wits. It was clear in these seminars that Rhees was not only devoted to exegesis of one of the finest thinkers of the twentieth century, but was, in fact, constantly absorbed in developing his own profound insights in Philosophy in repeated <b>tours</b> <b>de</b> <b>force.</b> He was self-effacing of his capacities and had to be persuaded to accept an honorary professorship at Swansea where he had previously turned down promotion during his teaching career.He died on 22 May 1989, and is buried at Oystermouth Cemetery in Mumbles near Swansea.|$|R
