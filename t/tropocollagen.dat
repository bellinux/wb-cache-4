5000|$|The <b>tropocollagen</b> {{subunits}} spontaneously self-assemble, with regularly staggered ends, into {{even larger}} arrays in the extracellular spaces of tissues. Additional assembly of fibrils {{is guided by}} fibroblasts, which deposit fully formed fibrils from fibripositors. In the fibrillar collagens, molecules are staggered to adjacent molecules by about 67 nm (a unit that {{is referred to as}} ‘D’ and changes depending upon the hydration state of the aggregate). In each D-period repeat of the microfibril, there is a part containing five molecules in cross-section, called the “overlap”, and a part containing only four molecules, called the [...] "gap". These overlap and gap regions are retained as microfibrils assemble into fibrils, and are thus viewable using electron microscopy. The triple helical tropocollagens in the microfibrils are arranged in a quasihexagonal packing pattern.There is some covalent crosslinking within the triple helices, and a variable amount of covalent crosslinking between <b>tropocollagen</b> helices forming well organized aggregates (such as fibrils). Larger fibrillar bundles are formed with the aid of several different classes of proteins (including different collagen types), glycoproteins and proteoglycans to form the different types of mature tissues from alternate combinations of the same key players. Collagen's insolubility was a barrier to the study of monomeric collagen until it was found that <b>tropocollagen</b> from young animals can be extracted because it is not yet fully crosslinked. However, advances in microscopy techniques (i.e. electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)) and X-ray diffraction have enabled researchers to obtain increasingly detailed images of collagen structure in situ. These later advances are particularly important to better understanding the way in which collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, and how tissues are constructed in growth and repair, and changed in development and disease. For example, using AFM-based nanoindentation {{it has been shown that}} a single collagen fibril is a heterogeneous material along its axial direction with significantly different mechanical properties in its gap and overlap regions, correlating with its different molecular organizations in these two regions.|$|E

5000|$|The ATP7A gene encodes a {{transmembrane protein}} that {{transport}} copper across the cell membranes. It is {{found throughout the}} body, except for the liver. In the small intestines, the ATP7A protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the protein travels between the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane to maintain copper concentrations in the cell. The protein is normally found in the Golgi apparatus, which is important for modifying proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, ATP7A protein provides copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. One of the enzymes, lysyl oxidase, requires copper for proper function. This enzyme cross-links <b>tropocollagen</b> into strong collagen fibrils.

50|$|For example, {{proteins}} {{constitute the}} elementary {{building blocks of}} a vast variety of biological materials such as cells, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved. Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or <b>tropocollagen</b> molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particularfilament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality-diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of materiomics. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and biomimetic material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.|$|E

These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or [...] "super helix", a cooperative quaternary structure stabilized by many hydrogen bonds. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens, if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril.

5000|$|Histologically, tendons {{consist of}} dense regular {{connective}} tissue fascicles encased in dense irregular connective tissue sheaths. Normal healthy tendons are composed mostly of parallel arrays of collagen fibers closely packed together. The dry mass of normal tendons, which makes up about 30% {{of their total}} mass, is composed of about 86% collagen, 2% elastin, 1 - 5% proteoglycans, and 0.2% inorganic components such as copper, manganese, and calcium. The collagen portion {{is made up of}} 97 - 98% type I collagen, with small amounts of other types of collagen. These include type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones, type III collagen in the reticulin fibres of the vascular walls, type IX collagen, type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries, type V collagen in the vascular walls, and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone. Collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell, the terminal peptides are cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, and the <b>tropocollagen</b> molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is about 300 nm long and 1 - 2 nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50 - 500 nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles, which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50 - 300 μm, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100 - 500 μm. [...] Fascicles are bound by the endotendineum, which is a delicate loose connective tissue containing thin collagen fibrils. and elastic fibres. Groups of fascicles are bounded by the epitenon. Filling the interstitia within the fascia where the tendon is located is the paratenon a fatty areolar tissue.|$|E

The extent of digestion of <b>tropocollagen</b> monomers in solution was directly proportional to the enzyme concentration (a range of enzyme substrate molar ratios 1 : 200 to 1 : 10 was used). The extent of digestion of polymeric collagen was followed by measuring the solubilization of fluorescent peptides from fluorescent-labelled insoluble polymeric collagen fibrils. The extent of digestion of <b>tropocollagen</b> within polymeric collagen was linear over a very small range of enzyme concentrations, when the enzyme/substrate ratio in the reaction mixture was less than 1 : 400 on a molecular basis.
