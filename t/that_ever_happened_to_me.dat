500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

[...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her.

After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E

We was off the Banks, {{and the time of}} year was July, and the ice was coming down, and we got in among a lot of it. Not far away, off our weather bow, there was a little iceberg which had such a queerness about it that the captain and three men went in a boat to look at it. The ice was mighty clear ice, and you could see almost through it, and right inside of it, not more than three feet above the waterline, and about two feet, or maybe twenty inches, inside the ice, was a whopping big shark, about {{fourteen}} feet long,--a regular man-eater,--frozen in there hard and fast. `Bless my soul,' said the captain, `this is a wonderful curiosity, and I'm going to git him out.' Just then one of the men said he saw that shark wink, but the captain wouldn't believe him, for he said that shark was frozen stiff and hard and couldn't wink. You see, the captain had his own idees about things, and he knew that whales was warm-blooded and would freeze if they was shut up in ice, but he forgot that sharks was not whales and that they're cold-blooded just like toads. And there is toads that has been shut up in rocks for thousands of years, and they stayed alive, no matter how cold the place was, because they was cold-blooded, and when the rocks was split, out hopped the frog. But, as I said before, the captain forgot sharks was cold-blooded, and he determined to git that one out.|$|E
