2500|$|Meedan’s <b>translation</b> <b>technology</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} in collaboration with The Watson Research Group at IBM with which it entered into a research partnership in 2006. Development has focused on Machine and Machine Augmented Translation tools that enable users to improve translations collaboratively, including IBM’s Transbrowser – a browser tool for creating a translation layer on the web. Perhaps most significantly, Meedan is open licensing the linguistic data generated from its efforts. Improved translation automation and augmentation has profound implications in global media, education, and business and information services; [...] Meedan hopes to play a small part by leading an effort to steer the global computational linguistics community to embrace open licensing of linguistic corpora. [...] Meedan aims {{to contribute to the}} Arabic English linguistic corpus, and therefore improve MT quality, by providing translation services to individuals and partner organizations. Meedan is especially interested in advancing progress in the under served direction of source English to target Arabic Machine Translation.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>translation</b> <b>technologies,</b> especially <b>translation</b> memory software, {{has had a}} significant impact on both the translator’s professional practice and the target text itself. Apart from the fact that he or she must translate in a non-linear fashion due to the design of translation memory systems, the translator is now called upon to increase output and, in many cases, recycle what has already been translated by others. As a result, the translator, used to having full control over his or her text, is in some regards losing control over the translation process, which brings him or her to reflect on the quality of the final product and, in turn, on the transformations the field of specialized translation is undergoing. In this paper, I will present the results of an important ethnographic study conducted in three Canadian translation environments. I will focus mostly on the effects <b>translation</b> <b>technologies</b> and newly implemented practices have had on the quality of specialized texts destined for the Canadian market, where most of the specialized texts produced in French are in fact translations.
