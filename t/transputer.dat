25|$|<b>Transputer</b> a {{processor}} implementing CSP concepts.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, British company Inmos {{known for}} its <b>transputer</b> {{microprocessors}} from parent Thorn EMI.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{important}} application of CSP was its use for specification and verification of {{elements of the}} INMOS T9000 <b>Transputer,</b> a complex superscalar pipelined processor designed to support large-scale multiprocessing. CSP was employed in verifying the correctness of both the processor pipeline, and the Virtual Channel Processor which managed off-chip communications for the processor.|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of <b>transputers</b> in control systems is investigated. This {{is done by}} implementing a controller for a flexible robot arm with one degree of freedom on a system consisting of an IBM-AT and four <b>transputers.</b> It is found that a control system with <b>transputers</b> offers a great improvement compared with conventional digital control systems. <b>Transputers</b> can solve the common problem in control practice, i. e. having very sophisticted controllers but {{not being able to}} implement them because they need too much computing time. However, <b>transputers</b> are not an optimal solution for more sophisticated control systems because of shortcomings in the scheduling mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Unveiled in 1991, PARAM 8000 used Inmos T800 <b>transputers.</b> <b>Transputers</b> were {{a fairly}} new and {{innovative}} microprocessor architecture designed for parallel processing at the time. It was a distributed memory MIMD architecture with a reconfigurable interconnection network. It had 64 CPUs. Exported to Germany, UK and Russia.|$|R
5000|$|All {{of these}} were {{connected}} using the <b>transputer's</b> 20 Mbit/s processor links. The motherboard also contained three slots for additional [...] "farm cards" [...] containing four <b>transputers</b> each, meaning that a fully expanded ATW contained 13 <b>transputers.</b> Each ran at 20 MHz (the -20 in the name) which supplied about 10 MIPS each. The bus was also available externally, allowing several ATWs to be connected into one large farm. The motherboard also included a separate slot {{for one of the}} INMOS crossbar switches to improve inter-chip networking performance.|$|R
25|$|CSP {{was first}} {{described}} in a 1977 paper by Tony Hoare, but has since evolved substantially. CSP has been practically applied in industry {{as a tool for}} specifying and verifying the concurrent aspects of a variety of different systems, such as the T9000 <b>Transputer,</b> as well as a secure ecommerce system. The theory of CSP itself is also still the subject of active research, including work to increase its range of practical applicability (e.g., increasing the scale of the systems that can be tractably analyzed).|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} 'wish list' was completed, {{hardware}} design company Varisys {{had been chosen}} as a partner based on their track record both with the PowerPC architecture and with parallel computing. The decision to form a partnership with Varisys had the consequence of bringing XMOS chips to the AmigaOne X1000, {{as it is the}} connection between XMOS and the Varisys team, dating back to earlier work on the Inmos <b>Transputer,</b> that led to the suggestion of including an XMOS XCore chip on the X1000 motherboard. This XCore chip is referred to by A-Eon as the 'Xena' Coprocessor.|$|E
500|$|Current {{academics}} at the University of Bristol include 18 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 10 fellows of the British Academy, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 31 fellows of the Royal Society. These include, Sir Michael Berry, {{one of the}} discoverers {{of quantum}} mechanics' [...] "geometric phase", John Rarity international expert on quantum optics, quantum cryptography and quantum communication, David May, computer scientist and lead architect for the <b>transputer,</b> Mark Horton, a British maritime and historical archaeologist.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>transputers</b> were {{announced}} in 1983 and released in 1984.|$|R
50|$|<b>Transputers</b> {{also found}} use in {{protocol}} analysers {{such as the}} Siemens/Tektronix K1103.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{designed}} for the Inmos T9000-transputers, it could never be launched as such, since the Inmos T9000 <b>transputers</b> itself {{never made it to}} the market in good time.This {{led to the development of}} the GC/PP (PowerPlus) in which two Motorola MPC 601 (80 MHz) were used as the dedicated CPUs supported by four <b>transputers</b> T805 (30 MHz) ...|$|R
2500|$|Bristol, UK This R site {{housed the}} British company Inmos which in 1978 began {{development}} of the famous <b>Transputer</b> microprocessor. [...] The site was acquired with Inmos in 1994, and was primarily involved with the design of home video and entertainment products (e.g. Set-Top Box), GPS chips, and accompanying software. At its peak the site employed more than 250 employees. The site officially closed on March 31, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology {{developed}} a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super-rare <b>transputer</b> chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft & Virtual Light Co.). The VLM {{developed a}}fter Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, {{and this was}} real-time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and live camera video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own [...] "Video Light" [...] system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simoultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM {{was used by the}} Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. [...] By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.|$|E
50|$|For {{some time}} in the late 1980s, many {{considered}} the <b>transputer</b> to be the next great design for the future of computing. While Inmos and the <b>transputer</b> did not ultimately live up to this expectation, the <b>transputer</b> architecture was highly influential in provoking new ideas in computer architecture, several of which have re-emerged in different forms in modern systems.|$|E
50|$|The German company Jäger Messtechnik used <b>transputers</b> {{for their}} early ADwin {{real-time}} data acquisition and control products.|$|R
50|$|The HETE-2 {{spacecraft}} currently uses 4× T805 <b>transputers</b> and 8× DSP56001 yielding about 100 MIPS of performance.|$|R
50|$|All <b>transputers</b> {{ran from}} an {{external}} 5 MHz clock input; this was multiplied {{to provide the}} processor clock.|$|R
50|$|The {{paradigm}} {{was originally}} invented for parallel {{computers in the}} 1980s, especially computers built with <b>transputer</b> microprocessors by INMOS, or similar architectures. Occam was an early process-oriented language developed for the <b>Transputer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In April 1989, Inmos {{was sold}} to SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). Around the same time, work was started on an {{enhanced}} <b>transputer,</b> the T9000. This encountered various technical problems and delays, and was eventually abandoned, signalling {{the end of the}} development of the <b>transputer</b> as a parallel processing platform. However, <b>transputer</b> derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as set-top boxes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>transputer</b> {{achieved}} {{some success}} {{as the basis}} for several parallel supercomputers from companies such as Meiko (formed by ex-Inmos employees in 1985), Floating Point Systems, Parsytec and Parsys. It was used in a few workstations, the most notable probably being the Atari <b>Transputer</b> Workstation. Being a relatively self-contained design, it was also used in some embedded systems. However, the unconventional nature of the <b>transputer</b> and its native occam programming language limited its appeal. During the late 1980s, the <b>transputer</b> (even in its later T800 form) also struggled {{to keep up with the}} ever-increasing performance of its competitors.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{embedded}} processors greatly {{enhances the}} capabilities of personal computers when used for telemetry processing and command control center functions. Parallel architectures based {{on the use of}} <b>transputers</b> are shown to be very versatile and reusable, and the synergism between the PC and the embedded processor with <b>transputers</b> results in single unit, low cost workstations of 20 less than MIPS {{less than or equal to}} 1000...|$|R
40|$|The image {{processing}} capability of a multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream (MIMD) architecture, {{based on a}} network of <b>transputers,</b> has been evaluated for {{the case of the}} parallel implementation of a digital median filter. An effort has been made to give a clearly explained, practical use of <b>transputers,</b> which make parallel processing an affordable affair. The software and the hardware architectures are described along with basic results...|$|R

50|$|When Inmos {{was formed}} in 1978, May joined to work on {{microcomputer}} architecture, becoming lead architect of the <b>transputer</b> and designer of the associated programming language Occam. This extended his earlier work and was also influenced by Tony Hoare, {{who was at the}} time working on CSP and acting as a consultant to Inmos. The prototype of the <b>transputer</b> was called the Simple 42 and was completed in 1982. The first production transputers, the T212 and T414, followed in 1985; the T800 floating point <b>transputer</b> in 1987. May initiated the design of one of the first VLSI packet switches, the C104, together with the communications system of the T9000 <b>transputer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The initial occam {{development}} {{environment for the}} <b>transputer</b> was the Inmos D700 <b>Transputer</b> Development System (TDS). This was an unorthodox integrated {{development environment}} incorporating an editor, compiler, linker and (post-mortem) debugger. The TDS was itself a <b>transputer</b> application written in occam. The TDS text editor was notable {{in that it was}} a folding editor, allowing blocks of code to be hidden and revealed, to make the structure of the code more apparent. Unfortunately, the combination of an unfamiliar programming language and equally unfamiliar development environment did nothing for the early popularity of the <b>transputer.</b> Later, Inmos would release more conventional occam cross-compilers, the occam 2 Toolsets.|$|E
5000|$|Inmos also {{produced}} {{a variety of}} support chips for the <b>transputer</b> processors, such as the C004 32-way link switch and the C012 [...] "link adapter" [...] which allowed <b>transputer</b> links to be interfaced to an 8-bit data bus.|$|E
50|$|Versions {{exist for}} the Cray X-MP, Y-MP, 2; Sequent, Encore Alliant, DEC VAX-11/784, {{dataflow}} architectures, KSR1, <b>Transputers</b> and systolic arrays.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} process evacuation, a technique for moving processes between processing elements {{in the presence of}} faults. The technique forms part of the RaFT support environment, a framework for building fault-tolerant applications on <b>transputers.</b> The paper describes the layered structure of the support environment and how process evacuation fits into this structure. Finally, details are given of how process evacuation can be implemented in the context of <b>transputers...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{describe}} {{the use of}} Self-Organising Fuzzy Logic Control (SOFLC) for automated drug delivery in muscle relaxant anaesthesia. The self-elicitation of a knowledge base is shown to be robust {{in the presence of}} model uncertainty, noise contamination and parameter changes. Being computing intensive, SOFLC is considered for parallel implementation on <b>transputers,</b> both via use of Lisp interpreter and direct Occam coding. SOFLC in Occam code gave a fast implementation, which could be further speeded up using multiple <b>transputers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Transputers {{could be}} booted over the network links (as {{opposed to the}} memory as in most machines) so a single <b>transputer</b> could start up the entire network. There was a pin called BootFromROM that when {{asserted}} caused the <b>transputer</b> to start two bytes {{from the top of}} memory (sufficient for up to a 256 byte backward jump, usually out of ROM). When this pin was not asserted, the first byte that arrived down any link was the length of a bootstrap to be downloaded, which was placed in low memory and run. The 'special' lengths of 0 and 1 were reserved for PEEK and POKE - allowing inspection and changing of RAM in an unbooted <b>transputer.</b> After a peek (which required an address) or a poke (which took a word address, and a word of data - 16 or 32 bit depending on the basic word width of the <b>transputer</b> variant) the <b>transputer</b> would return to waiting for a bootstrap.|$|E
50|$|Helios was {{predominantly}} {{an operating}} system for <b>Transputer</b> systems. It supported products from various manufacturers including INMOS' TRAM systems, the Meiko CS, Parsytec MultiCluster and SuperCluster, and the Telmat T.Node. The Atari <b>Transputer</b> Workstation {{was perhaps the}} highest profile Helios hardware, at least outside academia.|$|E
50|$|Perihelion Software {{produced}} an operating {{system for the}} INMOS <b>Transputer</b> called HeliOS. This was a system that looked like Unix but which could pass messages to processes running on either the same processor or another one. This {{was used in the}} Atari <b>Transputer</b> Workstation, among other places.|$|E
50|$|A network {{consisting}} of 20 workstations (Sun, DEC and Hewlett-Packard in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 <b>transputers</b> and OS Parix), and standard PCs {{connected to a}} network.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{implementation of a}} distributed parallel blackboard system that runs on a Meiko multitransputer system. The blackboard is split up amongst the <b>transputers</b> to allow for distributed local processing, yet the access of the blackboard is transparent to the user processes, irrespective of whether the data is local or remote. Multiple expert processes are invoked as processing resources become available and task dependencies are resolved. The implementation allows both task and data parallelism. A Canny edge detector implementation achieved a speedup of 21 times on 64 <b>transputers.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Multicluster-2 used network {{configuration}} units (NCUs) that provided flexible, dynamically configurable interconnection networks. The multiuser envirorunent could support {{up to eight}} users by using Parsytec's multiple virtual architecture software.The NCU design {{was based on the}} Inmos crossbar switch, the C004, which gives full crossbar connectivity for up to 16 <b>transputers.</b> Each NCU, made of C004s, connected up to 96 UniLinks that link internal as weil as external <b>transputers</b> and other I/0 subsystems.MultiCluster-2 provided the ability to configure a variety of fixed interconnection topologies such as tree or mesh structures.|$|R
