The objective was to study the <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> product characteristics such as the deposition velocities, spatial variability and dependence on aerosol particle concentrations. Since the deposition velocity is an important characteristic in the calibration of the DTPS, {{it is very important to}} study its dependence on aerosol concentration in a controlled environment. At low aerosol concentration (1500 particles/cm(3)) the mean effective deposition velocity was measured to be 0. 159 +/- 0. 045 m h(- 1); at high aerosol concentration (30 000 particles/cm 3) it decreased to 0. 079 +/- 0. 009 m h(- 1). The deposition velocity for the attached fraction of the <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> products did not change with increasing aerosol concentration, showing measurement results of 0. 048 +/- 0. 005 m h(- 1) and 0. 043 +/- 0. 014 m h(- 1), respectively. At low particle concentration, the effective deposition velocity showed large scattering within the room at different distances from center. The attached fraction deposition velocity remained uniform at different distances from the wall. The measurements in the thoron experimental house can be used as a sensitivity test of the DTPS in an indoor environment with changing aerosol concentration. The uniform spatial distribution of <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> products was confirmed within the experimental house. This indicates that direct measurement of <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> product concentration should be carried out instead of inferring it from thoron gas concentration, which is very inhomogeneous within the experimental house...|$|E

S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) had conducted an international collaborative epidemio-logical study. The LIH–NCI study showed an increased lung cancer risk due to high residential radon levels, and estimated the excess odds ratio at 100 Bq/m 3 to be 0. 19 (Wang et al., 2002). The present study used two types of newly developed passive monitors: One is a discriminative monitor for radon and thoron; {{the other is a}} selective monitor for <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> products. The arithmetic mean concentrations of indoor radon and thoron were 91 and 351 Bq/m 3, respec-tively. As reported by our previous study in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces (Tokonami et al., 2004), the presence of high thoron concentration was confirmed and thoron was predominant over radon in the cave dwellings. However, the mean equilibrium equivalent thoron concen-tration (EETC) was found to be much lower than expected when assuming the equilibrium fac-tor of 0. 1 provided by the UNSCEAR (2000) report.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the physical behavior of <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> products in outdoor air at ground level, and the resulting exposuredose coefficient, measurements of the concentrations of thoron (""Rn) gas and its short-lived decay products ("" 0, ^I 2 Pb, ^I 2 Bi) in attached-to-aerosol and unattached states were carried out at a semi-arid field site in central New Mexico under varying atmospheric conditions. A high volume air sampler (100 L mid) with a single 635 mesh stainless steel screen (50 % penetration for 4 nm particles) and a glass fiber filter were employed. Analysis of the 105 outdoor measurements yielded the following average values: 9 Bq ma for the ""Rn activity concentration; 22 nJ ma for the concentration of potential alpha energy, 0. 03 for the equilibrium factor, 0. 15 for the unattached fraction of potential alpha energy, and 14 nSv h " for the effective dose rate. The activity concentration of thoron gas and the unattached fraction of potential alpha energy {{are similar to those}} of radon and its decay products at this site but the equilibrium factor and dose rate are smaller.

The peaks corresponding to the energies of alpha particles emitted by the specific isotopes are particularly large on the low-energy side of the peak maximum, and the energy resolution strongly depended on the applied filters. The analysis was based on the non-linear regression to a function designed for four, six and eight parameters. Satisfactory results were obtained for each of these functions, and the best-fitting results were achieved for the eight-parameter function.

Hierzu wurden waehrend der Bestaubung eines Aerosolfilters die " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb- und " 2 " 1 " 2 Bi-Filteraktivitaeten gammaspektrometrisch bestimmt und hieraus die Tagesmittelwerte der " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb-Konzentrationen berechnet und die so erhaltenen Zeitreihen analysiert. Der langfristige Mittelwert der " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb-Konzentration bzw. der EEC_R_n_ 2 _ 2 _ 0 betrug 0, 0835 Bq m"-" 3. Waehrend die Tagesmittelwerte zwischen #<=# 0, 01 und 0. 34 Bq m"-" 3 und die Monatsmittelwerte zwischen 0, 032 und 0, 16 Bq m"-" 3 variieren, bewegen sich die Jahresmittelwerte zwischen 0, 075 und 0, 090 Bq m"-" 3. Hieraus errechnet sich eine mittlere effektive Jahresdosis von 1, 5 #mu#Sv, was etwa 2 % der Dosis entspricht, die sich aus der mittleren gleichgewichtsaequivalenten Radonkonzentration (EEC_R_n_-_ 2 _ 2 _ 2) von 8, 4 Bq m"-" 3 im gleichen Zeitraum in Muenchen-Neuherberg ergibt. Das jahreszeitliche Muster der atmosphaerischen " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb-Konzentration ist durch zwei Maxima gekennzeichnet: durch ein erstes Maximum im Mai und durch ein zweites im September. Niedrige Konzentrationen werden in jedem Jahr zwischen November und Februar beobachtet. Dieses jahreszeitliche Verhalten kann im wesentlichen durch die stark eingeschraenkte Exhalation des Thoron in den Wintermonaten und den erhoehten Fluss in den warmen Sommermonaten erklaert werden. Wegen starker Niederschlaege im Juni und Juli wird das atmosphaerische " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb in diesen Monaten jedoch verstaerkt ausgewaschen. Die auf Grund des erhoehten Thoronflusses in den Sommermonaten verstaerkte Produktion der Thoronfolgeprodukte wird hierdurch ueberkompensiert, sodass es zu einem Einbruch im " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb-Konzentrationsverlauf zwischen Mai und September kommt. Fuer den Monat Juni wurde durch Regressionsanalyse ein statistisch signifikanter Zusammenhang (R" 2 = 0, 58, p< 0, 01) zwischen " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb-Konzentration und Niederschlagssumme nachgewiesen. (orig.) Seasonal and {{long-term}} {{variation of the}} ground-level air concentration of the <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> product " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb (10. 6 h), representative of the equilibrium equivalent thoron concentration (EEC_R_n_-_ 2 _ 2 _ 0), was investigated from 1989 through 2000 at Munich-Neuherberg. For this, " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb and " 2 " 1 " 2 Bi filter activities were determined gamma-spectrometrically during aerosol collection, and daily mean " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb concentrations (or EEC_R_n_ 2 _ 2 _ 0) were calculated. The resulting time series were analysed. The measurements yielded a long-term average concentration of 0. 0835 Bq m"-" 3. Daily mean concentrations varied from #<=# 0. 01 to 0. 34 Bq m"-" 3, monthly mean concentrations from 0, 032 to 0, 16 Bq m"-" 3, and annual mean concentrations ranged from 0. 075 to 0. 090 Bq m"-" 3. An average annual effective dose of 1. 5 #mu#Sv due to outdoor thoron progeny concentration was estimated, which corresponds to about 2 % of the dose due to the average short-lived radon progeny concentration (EEC_R_n_-_ 2 _ 2 _ 2) of 8. 4 Bq m"-" 3 measured at Munich-Neuherberg in the same period. The seasonal pattern of " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb activity concentration in the atmosphere is characterised by two maxima each year: the first in May and the second in September. Low concentrations are observed from November through February. The most probably reason for this seasonal behaviour is the extremely reduced flux of thoron gas from the ground {{during the winter months}} and the enhanced flux in the summer months. Due to strong rain showers from June to July, airborne " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb is distinctly washed out from the atmosphere in these months. This overcompensates the enhanced production of <b>thoron</b> <b>decay</b> products due to the enhanced flux in the warm summer months and yields the concentration minimum between May and September. For June, a statistical significant relationship (R" 2 = 0. 58, p< 0. 01) was detected between " 2 " 1 " 2 Pb air concentration and precipitation by regression analysis. (orig.)

The goal of {{our work}} was to {{determine}} the distributions of radon and thoron progeny concentrations in dwellings, the magnitude of individual and collective exposures and to assess the potential lung cancer risk. The radon and <b>thoron</b> short-lived <b>decay</b> products concentrations have been measured in 586 typical urban and rural houses, randomly selected from 6 cities and 84 villages in eastern part of Romania. The method used to determine the volumetric activity of 218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi and 212 Pb is an active one by pumping a known volume of air through an open-faced high-efficiency filter paper at known flow rate for a certain collection time and counting the deposited activity with a ZnS alpha scintillation counter. Internal exposure due to inhalation of radon and thoron progeny indoors and outdoors has been expressed in terms of effective dose. In dose estimates the conversion coefficients adopted by the UNSCEAR 2000 Report have been used. The values of indoor Equilibrium Equivalent Concentrations of radon and thoron presented a log-normal distribution. The average values of EEC of radon have been of 22. 2 Bq m- 3 in detached houses and 9. 0 Bq m- 3 in block o f flats and for EEC of thoron, 1. 2 Bq m- 3 in detached houses and 0. 6 Bq m- 3 in block of flats...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} investigation into radon equilibrium {{under a variety of}} constraints will be presented, e. g. response to metallic daughter plate-out, response to modulation of radon ingress and phase relationship of alpha activity to cyclically modulated radon ingress. At the core of this investigation is the development of Monte-Carlo simulations of the radon (Rn- 222) and <b>thoron</b> (Rn- 220) <b>decay</b> chains. Currently, these simulations assume an hypothetical closed cubic metre of atmosphere and the simulations are time-stepped at constant interval. At each time-step, there is a radon or thoron ingress and each nuclei in the decay chains decays probabilistically, with nuclei and activity being aggregated and tabulated {{at the end of each}} time-step. Currently, the simulations have been coded in two open-source interpreted mathematical software packages; Scilab [URL] and Yorick ([URL] This has required that the decay chains are considered sequentially (in reverse order) within each time-step. However, once the simulations are ﬁnalised, these will be compiled to run on multi-core/CPU systems allowing the decay chain calculations to be paralleled at each time-step. This will allow much ﬁner time resolution and generation of a larger statistical base from which to draw conclusions. ...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{work has}} been carried out on {{measurement}} of radon and thoron levels in indoor environment in last three decades. These studies are important from radiation protection point of view, if one considered the contribution of radon, <b>thoron</b> and their <b>decay</b> products to total inhalation dose. Numerous studies on radon measurement well established the behaviour of its dispersion in dwellings. But the short lives of thoron cause the difficulty to understand the distribution of thoron in dwellings. The problem becomes more complicated when thoron dispersion is studied under different inlet air flow rate. Different air flow pattern may cause different thoron level at different point in test dwellings causing uncertainty in the measurements. This work utilized the CFD simulation technique for study of indoor thoron dispersion in test dwellings under normal and turbulent flow of air. The simulation study for thoron distribution in a test room was performed for air velocities 0. 10 ms- 1, 0. 25 ms- 1, 0. 50 ms- 1, 1. 0 ms- 1, 1. 5 ms- 1, and 2. 0 ms- 1. The results show that the thoron distribution becomes uniform for the inlet velocity more than 0. 5 ms- 1 and appropriate to measure indoor thoron concentration.

40|$|Regulating the {{environmental}} discharge of Rn- 220 (historically known as <b>thoron)</b> and its <b>decay</b> products from thorium processing facilities {{is important for}} protection of environment and general public living in the vicinities. Activated charcoal provides an effective {{solution to this problem}} because of its high adsorption capacity to gaseous element like radon. In order to design and develop a charcoal based Thoron Mitigation System, a mathematical model has been developed in the present work for studying the Rn- 220 transport and adsorption in a flow through charcoal bed and estimating the Rn- 220 mitigation factor (MF) as a function of system and operating parameters. The model accounts for inter- and intragrain diffusion, advection, radioactive decay and adsorption processes. Also, the effects of large void fluctuation and wall channeling on the mitigation factor have been included through a statistical model. Closed form solution has been provided for the MF in terms of adsorption coefficient, system dimensions, grain size, flow rate and void fluctuation exponent. It is shown that the delay effects due to intra grain diffusion plays a significant role thereby rendering external equilibrium assumptions unsuitable. Also, the application of the statistical model clearly demonstrates the transition from the exponential MF to a power-law form and shows how the occurrence of channels with low probability can lower mitigation factor by several orders of magnitude. As a part of aiding design, the model is further extended to optimise the bed dimensions in respect of pressure drop and MF. The application of the results for the design and development of a practically useful charcoal bed is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
