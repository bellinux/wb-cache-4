5|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in the BWCAW. Game species include northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and panfish. <b>Trout</b> including brook <b>trout,</b> brown <b>trout,</b> lake <b>trout,</b> rainbow <b>trout</b> and splake are also found. Limited stocking of walleye, brown <b>trout</b> and lake <b>trout</b> is done on some lakes.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} <b>trout,</b> northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull <b>trout,</b> which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of lake <b>trout</b> and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull <b>trout</b> and west slope cutthroat <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 92 percent of {{assessed}} streams in the watershed of Muncy Creek are inhabited by <b>trout.</b> Of the inhabited streams, 82 percent are inhabited only by brook <b>trout,</b> nine percent are inhabited by only brown <b>trout,</b> and nine percent are inhabited by both brook <b>trout</b> and brown <b>trout.</b> A number of tributaries {{of the creek}} are designated as high-quality coldwater fisheries. These include Lick Run, Roaring Run, Rock Run, and Spring Run in Lycoming County and Big Run, <b>Trout</b> Run, {{and a number of}} others in Sullivan County.|$|E

50|$|When the Civil War erupted, celebration {{erupted in}} <b>Trout's</b> Hill and the American flag was {{replaced}} by the Virginia flag. In late August 1861, a three-day skirmish raged in the streets of <b>Trout's</b> Hill as Union troops from Ceredo tried to obtain the county records. The Union men camped in the courthouse, and local Rebels tried to force them out. Having accomplished their goal, the Yankees returned to Ceredo. Several more Union raids were launched against <b>Trout's</b> Hill During the war.|$|R
5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of {{all but two of}} its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness <b>Trout</b> Streams in Wyoming County. Wild <b>trout</b> naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters. Most hold this designation for brook <b>trout</b> only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow <b>trout,</b> either instead of or in addition to brook <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cotto's next {{fight was}} on December 1, 2012, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His {{opponent}} was the undefeated WBA Super Welterweight Champion Austin <b>Trout.</b> <b>Trout</b> started the fight off fast, using his quick combinations to continually get his punches off first against Cotto. <b>Trout</b> also used his superior footwork to evade most of Cotto's punches, {{and was able}} to out muscle Cotto off the ropes when he was cornered in the fight. During the middle rounds, Cotto found success trapping <b>Trout</b> on the ropes and keeping him there, ripping <b>Trout</b> with body shots and finding the range with his left hook. <b>Trout</b> regained control in the later rounds, even backing Cotto up later in the fight, and stunned Cotto several times down the stretch with his straight left hand. <b>Trout</b> won the fight by a wide unanimous decision, giving him the biggest win of his career thus far. The judges scores were 117-111, 117-111, 119-109. <b>Trout</b> landed 238 of 779 punches (31%) and Cotto landed 183 of 628 punches thrown (29%). After the fight, <b>Trout</b> called out fellow light middleweight champion Canelo Álvarez. The fight averaged averaged 1.047 million and peaked at 1.4 million viewers, which set a record for Showtime boxing.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} <b>trout</b> in sea-run, resident {{stream and}} lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run cutthroat <b>trout</b> fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat <b>trout</b> along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for <b>trout</b> along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat <b>trout</b> sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat <b>trout</b> subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E

Compared with the sequences of other fishes, <b>trout’s</b> GATM showed an insertion of one amino acid at position 39 (tyrosine). While the complete alignment showed an overall very high conservation, the sequences were quite diverse between position 30 and 65 of the alignment. The probability of export to mitochondria for <b>trout’s</b> GATM was calculated as 97 %.|$|R

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved <b>Trout</b> Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters throughout its length.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook <b>trout.</b> Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook <b>trout,</b> eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook <b>trout,</b> brown <b>trout,</b> and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook <b>trout,</b> blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown <b>trout,</b> white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E

40|$|Spawning aggregations of closely‐related coral <b>trouts,</b> Plectropomus leopardus and Plectropomus maculatus, {{were found}} to overlap {{in time and space}} on the Great Barrier Reef, thus {{providing}} opportunities for accidental hybridization by juxtaposition of heterospecific gametes. The relative abundance and mating strategy of coral <b>trouts</b> also favoured hybridization, since mates could be either rare in some habitats or monopolized by dominant fishes. In the latter case, sneak spawning may have occurred, even when behavioural barriers to reproduction (e. g. assortative mating) were operational. When heterospecific gametes were experimentally mixed, fertilization occurred and hybrid larvae developed. It was concluded that there was considerable opportunity for natural hybridization between coral <b>trouts</b> of the genus Plectropomus...|$|R
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} <b>trout</b> (or Snake River cutthroat <b>trout)</b> is {{the only}} native <b>trout</b> species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat <b>trout</b> that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat <b>trout</b> and the Yellowstone cutthroat <b>trout,</b> though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat <b>trout</b> was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat <b>trout</b> is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of <b>trout</b> such as the rainbow <b>trout</b> and lake <b>trout</b> were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five <b>trout</b> species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild <b>trout</b> naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters for both brook <b>trout</b> and brown <b>trout.</b> The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters for brook <b>trout</b> {{and part of the}} tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters for both brook <b>trout</b> and brown <b>trout.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of bull <b>trout</b> and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook <b>trout,</b> and rainbow <b>trout.</b> Lake <b>trout,</b> westslope cutthroat <b>trout,</b> and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook <b>trout</b> and rainbow <b>trout</b> (Columbia River redband <b>trout),</b> are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown <b>trout</b> and {{cutthroat}} <b>trout</b> appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger <b>trout.</b> All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of <b>trout.</b> Bull <b>trout</b> {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat <b>trout</b> can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat <b>trout</b> are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild <b>trout</b> in Scotch Run in its lower reaches is 4.39 {{kilograms}} per hectare.
