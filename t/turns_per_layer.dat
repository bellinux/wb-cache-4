5000|$|Due to the fact, {{that the}} winding should be mostly {{positioned}} {{parallel to the}} winding flange, meeting an orthogonality condition, {{it is necessary to}} adjust the winding width to the number of <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> of the winding. In particular for noncircular shaped coil cross-sectional areas, it is desired to locate the crossover area to the small side of the coil body, also called winding head. This is due to the fact, that noncircular coils are being mounted on a sheet metal package or in a circular arrangement. The coils should be rather small, in order to avoid a contact with the neighboring coil or the sheet metal package. For orthocyclic round coils three winding geometries can be defined: ...|$|E

40|$|The two tracker {{solenoids}} for MICE [1]-[3] as-built {{are different}} from the original design proposed by Wang NMR [4]. The Wang NMR design is in turn different from the magnet design proposed in the original MICE tracker magnet specification [5]. The two tracker solenoids where fabricated with niobium titanium conductor supplied to LBNL by Luvata under a specification written by LBNL [6]. This report compares the as-built tracker solenoids to the original Wang NMR design [4]. The as-built solenoid coils are thicker by 5 to 8 percent than called for the original design. This means that the current center is moved outward from 0. 2 to 0. 5 percent. In both tracker magnets, the thickness of end coil 2 was increased by 2 -layers over the original design [5]. Thus, the current center for end coil 2 was moved outward by 0. 7 percent. The number of <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> was underestimated in the original design from 2 to 4 percent. As a result, the current in each of the five tracker solenoid coils must be increased. In turn, the two as built tracker solenoids are compared to each other. In the ways that matter, the two tracker solenoids are nearly identical to each other. The largest difference between the two magnets that matters is a 0. 05 percent change in the current in the center coil of the three coil set that forms the spectrometer solenoid. Since this is the largest variation that matters, it can be concluded that coils M 1, coils M 2, and the spectrometer solenoid can be connected in series without affecting the beam dynamics of MICE. This includes the two tuned end coils as well. The position of the coils within the cryostats vacuum vessel appears to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} has an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} research community and among the politicians. Therefore {{it is important to}} find the right solutions to meet the environmental and commercial requirements to give offshore wind power a promising future. This thesis are proposing a new converter topology for offshore wind parks. Since the topology is based on DC transmission in stead of AC transmission it is better suited for use in this type of parks. All the converters are located in the wind turbines and the turbines are connected in series directly connected to shore without any transformation stages. The one-phase AC to three-phase AC converter with the new switching pattern is explained and a method to calculate the losses in the converter is given. The loss calculation method is based on the characteristics of the switch found in the data sheet, which in this case is a RB-IGBT. The conduction losses, turn-on, turn-off and recovery losses for one switch are calculated and multiplied with the number of switches in the converter. An equation of the total losses per switch is given and there are performed loss simulations for the converter in PSCAD with good results. In the AC-AC converter there are bidirectional switches, in this case two reverse-blocking IGBTs. The RB-IGBT is compared to other types of bidirectional switches which is made of IGBTs and diodes in anti parallel. The comparison shows that with the RB-IGBTs the on-state voltage drop is halved since a RB-IGBT has the same on-state voltage drop as a normal IGBT. This also reduces the on-state losses. The architecture of the RB-IGBT is almost the same as the IGBT but with an extension of the p+ layer on the edges up to the gate isolation. This separates the sides from the active region of the chip so the leakage currents from the side surfaces of the device are blocked. A design of a high power high frequency transformer for the converter topology in the nacelle of the wind turbine is proposed. A design method is used and a program to calculate the necessary values is made. The transformer should be a double E-core with a centre leg of 4. 5 cm made of the ferrite material N 27. Both primary and secondary windings, which will be copper foils, should be wound on the centre leg of the core using a bobbin. The primary windings will be separated in two sections each section having 12 layers with two <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> <b>layer.</b> The secondary windings will be sandwiched between the primary sections and will consist of 24 layers with two turns per layers. Each foil conductor has a height of 4. 5 cm and a thickness of 0. 3165 mm. The new converter topology reduces the converter losses due to fewer converter stages, a new type of reverse-blocking IGBT and a new switching pattern. It also reduces the weight of the converter system because of no capacitors and a lighter transformer. This is important for floating wind turbines. A prototype of the converter topology with protection should be made to verify the results of this thesis. Simulation studies for the whole park during operation and faults should also be carried out to see if the topology fits the harsh conditions offshore. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of turbulence promoters such as helical baffles {{were shown to}} enhance permeate flux during crossflow microfiltration. Helical inserts reduce hold-up in the feed channel; increase fluid velocity and wall shear rates and produce secondary flows or instabilities. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of helical baffles on permeate flux during the microfiltration of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) dispersions and bakers yeast solutions. Tubular, single channel ceramic membranes with nominal pore size of 0. 2 Âµm were used. Variations of the helical baffle geometries, which are the number of <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> baffle length, were investigated. It is found that the insertion of helical baffles increased the permeate flux. In some cases, the increase was more than 100 %. The effect of number of <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> baffle length shows that the permeate flux increases with the number of turns but decreases when the number of turns is more than 4 <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> 50 mm baffle length. Thus, the optimum number of turn is 4 <b>turns</b> <b>per</b> 50 mm...|$|R

This study reports the fabrication of thin films of active CA enzyme onto a porous membrane substrate using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. Deposition of multilayer films consisting of polyelectrolytes and CA was monitored by quartz crystal microgravimetry, while the enzymatic activity was assayed according to the rates of p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NPA) hydrolysis and CO 2 hydration. The fabrication of the films onto a nonporous glass substrate showed CO 2 hydration rates of 0. 52 ± 0. 09 μmol cm(- 2) min(- 1) <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> of bovine CA and 2. 6 ± 0. 7 μmol cm(- 2) min(- 1) <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> of a thermostable microbial CA. The fabrication of a multilayer film containing the microbial CA on a porous polypropylene membrane increased the hydration rate to 5. 3 ± 0. 8 μmol cm(- 2) min(- 1) <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> of microbial CA. The addition of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a film layer prior to enzyme adsorption was found to increase the activity on the polypropylene membranes even further to a rate of 19 ± 4 μmol cm(- 2) min(- 1) <b>per</b> <b>layer</b> of microbial CA. The LbL treatment of these membranes increased the mass transfer resistance of the membrane but decreased the likelihood of membrane pore wetting.
