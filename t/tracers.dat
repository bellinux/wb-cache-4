5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive <b>tracers</b> at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} <b>tracers</b> of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 rounds per minute, and had an effective ceiling of 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective ceiling of 6,800m (22,310ft), though <b>tracers</b> were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft). They had a rate of fire of 30rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive <b>tracers</b> to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with <b>tracers</b> and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

40|$|The {{meteorological}} processes {{responsible for}} transporting <b>tracer</b> {{during the second}} ETEX (European <b>Tracer</b> Experiment) release are determined using the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). The UM predicted distribution of <b>tracer</b> is compared with observations from the ETEX campaign and predictions from the UK Met Office operational air quality forecast model (NAME). The dominant meteorological process is a warm conveyor belt which transports large amounts of <b>tracer</b> away from the surface up to a height of 4 km over a 36 hour period. Convection {{is also an important}} process, transporting <b>tracer</b> to heights of up to 8 km Potential sources of error when using an operational numerical weather prediction model to forecast air quality are also investigated. These potential sources of error include model dynamics, model resolution and model physics. In the UM a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme is used with polynomial interpolation. This can result in unrealistic negative values of <b>tracer</b> which, when combined with a positive definite scheme in which negative values of <b>tracer</b> are set to zero, results in a failure of the model to conserve <b>tracer</b> mass. This problem occurs where sharp gradients of <b>tracer</b> concentration exist, such as are found close to source locations and leads to an overprediction of <b>tracer</b> concentrations. Model resolution can also affect the accuracy of predicted <b>tracer</b> distributions. Low resolution simulations (50 km grid length) were unable to resolve a change in wind direction associated with the cold front, this led to an error in the transport direction and hence an error in <b>tracer</b> distribution. High resolution simulations (12 km grid length) captured the change in wind direction and hence produced a <b>tracer</b> distribution that compared better with the observations. The representation of convective mixing was found to have a large affect on the vertical transport of <b>tracer.</b> Turning off the convective mixing parameterisation in the UM significantly reduced the vertical transport of <b>tracer.</b> Finally, air quality forecasts were found {{to be sensitive to the}} timing of synoptic scale features. Errors in the position of the cold front relative to the <b>tracer</b> release location of only 1 hour resulted in changes in the predicted <b>tracer</b> concentrations that were of the same order of magnitude as the absolute <b>tracer</b> concentrations. ...|$|R
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical <b>tracers</b> by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
