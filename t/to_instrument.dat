5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known <b>to</b> <b>instrument</b> makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

25|$|Virtual {{profiling}} is {{a method}} of creating profiles without attaching the thermocouples (TCs) or having to physically instrument a PCB each and every time a profile is run for the same production board. All the typical profile data such as slope, soak, TAL, etc., that are measured by instrumented profiles are gathered by using virtual profiles. The benefits of not having attached TCs surpass the convenience of not having <b>to</b> <b>instrument</b> a PCB every time a new profile is needed.|$|E
25|$|Webern's music, {{like that}} of both Brahms and Schoenberg, is marked by its {{emphasis}} on counterpoint and formal considerations; and Webern's commitment to systematic pitch organization in the twelve-tone method is inseparable from this prior commitment. Webern's tone rows are often arranged {{to take advantage of}} internal symmetries; for example, a twelve-tone row may be divisible into four groups of three pitches which are variations, such as inversions and retrogrades, of each other, thus creating invariance. This gives Webern's work considerable motivic unity, although this is often obscured by the fragmentation of the melodic lines. This fragmentation occurs through octave displacement (using intervals greater than an octave) and by moving the line rapidly from instrument <b>to</b> <b>instrument</b> in a technique referred to as Klangfarbenmelodie.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according <b>to</b> <b>instrument</b> flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, {{makers of}} the new DHC-7 (Dash 7) STOL plane, {{proposed}} a network of STOL airports around Ontario, with the Island Airport as its hub, to the Government of Ontario cabinet ministers and the Government of Canada cabinet ministers. The first versions of the Dash 7 could support flights from the Island to smaller centers, such as Sarnia, Kingston, Peterborough and Owen Sound, with a larger version able to support flights to larger centers such as London, North Bay, Ottawa and Windsor. The island airport, which operated under visual flight rules, {{would have to be}} upgraded <b>to</b> <b>instrument</b> flight rules to operate the service. De Havilland also proposed a bridge to the island airport over the Western Gap. The Government of Ontario was interested in the proposal, and asked the Canadian government to work towards development of STOL.

2500|$|The Serioso is a {{transitional}} work that ushers in Beethoven's late period – {{a period of}} compositions of great introspection. [...] "The particular kind of inwardness of Beethoven's last style period", writes Joseph Kerman, gives one the feeling that [...] "the music is sounding only for the composer and for one other auditor, an awestruck eavesdropper: you." [...] In the late quartets, the quartet conversation is often disjointed, proceeding like a stream of consciousness. Melodies are broken off, or passed {{in the middle of}} the melodic line from instrument <b>to</b> <b>instrument.</b> Beethoven uses new effects, never before essayed in the string quartet literature: the ethereal, dreamlike effect of open intervals between the high E string and the open A string in the second movement of quartet Op. 132; the use of sul ponticello (playing on the bridge of the violin) for a brittle, scratchy sound in the Presto movement of Op. 131; the use of the Lydian mode, rarely heard in Western music for 200 years, in Op. 132; a cello melody played high above all the other strings in the finale of Op. 132. Yet for all this disjointedness, each quartet is tightly designed, with an overarching structure that ties the work together.|$|E
