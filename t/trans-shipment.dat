30|$|The {{paper of}} Gernot Liedtke {{focuses on the}} {{estimation}} of benefits of shippers from a multimodal transport network. This paper gives some results from a big research project under participation of shippers and forwarders called LOGOTAKT, which was to design, analyse and assess a synchronised logistic supply system for palletised consignments using a multimodal transport network. A behavioural model is developed to estimate the shippers’ reactions according to the expected economic benefits from the multimodal transport network. The model starts from {{the assumption that the}} players on the market for freight and logistics try to minimise cost, such that the construction of appropriate cost function is in the forefront of the analysis. This includes the modelling of economies of scale in transportation, which is a driver for the choice of multimodal supply chains. Simulations show that the developed intermodal transportation system has a significant impact on shipment size distributions changing them in favour of smaller shipments. This leads especially to significant reductions in warehouse costs. As on the main runs the railways can be the preferred mode on busy corridors, the approach shows that the idea of green logistics can stem from endogenous optimisation calculus of the market players. Nevertheless, some public support will be needed in the initial phase to help set up the freight hubs, which are needed for intermodal <b>trans-shipments</b> and consolidation of pallets.|$|R

40|$|Darwin, {{the capital}} of the Northern Territory, is a port city located in Australia’s Top End and facing Southeast Asia. The {{distance}} from Darwin to Australia’s main economic centres of Sydney and Melbourne is almost the same as to Singapore. This central geographical location has inspired the development of the Port and the City of Darwin from time to time while being held back by its remoteness, and especially the lack of an efficient railway link to Australia’s major southern centres. The Port of Darwin has been redeveloped with the vision of repositioning the City of Darwin as Australia’s gateway to Asia which it was expected to achieve with the completion of the transcontinental railwaylink from Adelaide to Darwin. This paper analyses trade and cargo movements for the Port of Darwin between 2000 and 2009 - 5 years for each period before and after the availability of intermodal transport - and examines the processes by which transformation of the gateway is actually occurring. The evidence to date, however, suggests that the landbridge development has had little material effect in terms of <b>trans-shipments</b> and throughputs for the Port of Darwin. The volume of container trade and interstate export and import cargo that passes through the port has in fact declined since the availability of the transcontinental railway in 2005...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} design {{strategies and}} operational planning techniques for multimode, multiservice networks for package delivery carriers where service levels {{are defined by}} the guaranteed delivery items of packages (e. g., overnight, two-day delivery, etc.). Large-scale transportation network design problems are typically challenging, due to {{the large number of}} interdependent decision variables and constraints. These problems are even more complex with multiple service levels. Conventional network design and routing models cannot sufficiently capture the complexity of multimode, multiservice networks. This thesis discusses two principal design and routing approaches employed in the literature, and shows how the two approaches can be integrated. One approach utilizes detailed mixed-integer programming formulations and numerical methods. The other employs less detailed models based on continuous approximations. While the first approach provides a much higher level of detail, the second is more revealing of “the big picture”. Therefore, numerical methods are well suited for operational control, while continuous approximation methods are particularly effective for strategic planning and design, especially under uncertainty. An approach based on the complementary use of analytical approximation models and numerical optimization is developed to design, test and evaluate integrated strategies. This is the first application of hybrid continuous approximation/numerical optimization models to large-scale integrated networks with shipment choice. As such, advancements in both continuous approximation and numerical optimization, and the integration of the two, are required. Continuous approximation cost functions are shown to be capable of realistically modeling complex distribution systems with multiple <b>trans-shipments</b> and peddling tours. This research also demonstrates the application of solution techniques to reduce complex cost models to a series of subproblems that can be solved with common spreadsheet technology. Cost components are shown to accurately model costs using independent cost validation. A variety of integration scenarios are analyzed and the advantages of integrated operations are presented. Qualitative conclusions suggest that benefits of integration are greater when deferred demand exceeds express demand. This insight helps to explain the different business strategies of package delivery firms in industry today. This research demonstrates how hybrid modeling approaches can be used to better understand and better plan operating strategies for distribution companies...|$|R

This {{in-depth}} study has {{the intention of}} producing an overall analysis and description {{of the evolution of}} waterfront regeneration projects in European port cities and uses this to conclude with an exploration of the future for such regeneration projects through a reflection on the lessons that can be learned from projects both complete and under construction at present. At present, {{there is a lack of}} study related to contemporary waterfront regeneration undertaken in European countries. Therefore, this thesis aims to fill the research gaps and provide a holistic picture of European waterfront regeneration.   Port cities have a unique perspective in terms of urban renewal. They marry undisputedly industrial heritage with a historical significance geographically. As such cities, and the shipping industries central to their historical value, have undergone waves of development across time, there have been corresponding physical shifts in the ports themselves and subsequently, dereliction of key areas close to the traditional city core. It is the approaches and processes which have been chosen to regenerate these areas that are at the heart of this study. It can be argued that it would be reasonable and productive to see such projects as laboratories for the process of urban renewal on a wider scale and the lessons drawn as instructive for contemporary architecture and planning. To reach its conclusions in a rigorous and scientific fashion, this study begins by establishing a definition for a port city waterfront, and the range of waterfront types within these parameters is described. Remaining within the parameters, an overview of the requirements of such projects is taken and a lexical analysis of the term itself is outlined. This enables the study to note where individual projects vary from the generic needs and conditions of waterfront regeneration projects.   The methodology applied in this research consisted of documentary review of waterfront regeneration, and case studies based on the questions. The primary data were based on site visits and master plans. The secondary data came from development strategy and other documents provided by public authorities and academic publications. This is detailed in the first chapter along with the purpose of the thesis and other points outlined above. Contemporary projects cannot be considered without contextualizing them. They need to be framed by a global perspective, taking in port cities from St Petersburg to San Francisco, as well as by a chronological context taking in the distant origins of port cities in terms of function and scale and bringing them up to the present day via the influence of industrialization, global exploration, advances in shipping technology, and containerization: each of which has impacted the ports directly and their surrounding hinterland by proxy. This historical background is described in the second chapter and key turning points within the history are identified. Once detailed and examined, it can be argued that the developments coincide with different movements within architecture and so each time span has added its own characteristics. This is, therefore, an important opportunity to analyze the different eras and their impact on architecture. Because of their geopolitical locations and the interest port city waterfront projects have garnered from various agents and actors, regenerated port areas have somehow become a reflection of the contemporary architecture of each decade since the 1960 s and provide a microscope under which key features of the architectural movements of each period can be identified. The final elements examined in the second chapter include a look at the organizations concerned with regeneration projects, the typologies of different projects as well as the organizational structure of the project itself. Four case studies were chosen to exemplify successive waves of port city renewal – London Docklands, Genoa Expo, Hamburg Hafencity and Izmir – and these are explored in the third chapter. However, the case studies do not include a project from the first wave, which is generally agreed to be located in North America in the 1960 s. These projects are used only as background to the cases set in Europe, where this study is focused. As such, while regeneration projects in the United States, such as Baltimore and San Francisco, are referenced, they do not form part of the key analysis. Additional factors in the choice of case studies includes the fact that the study deals with different scales of transformation, which can be seen in the various examples. Not only that but the case studies were also selected from different decades to reflect the effect of accumulated experience in European waterfront projects culminating in suggestions for the Izmir project. The breakdown of the case studies is dealt with systematically. Building on the historical exploration of chapter two, the historical backgrounds and especially the reasons for decline are explored within chapter three. Once the reasons behind the area becoming de-industrialized are clear, the processes and approaches of the regeneration project are detailed. This involves first analyzing the objectives, for example, commercial, social or conservative. Additionally, the processes for funding and deployment as well as the organizational structure of the project will be described and analysed with regard to the apparent success of the case. the architectural and urban design approaches, and ultimately, the outcomes of the projects. Each of these elements will be explained in sub-chapters and key features uniting the projects will be drawn out. One aspect that reveals variation between port cities relates to the value placed on the land by a number of parties who are involved; be they political, commercial or social in nature. Exploring the extent of participation and ambition by such stakeholders in different generation projects is a particularly key feature of this study. Variation also arises as a result of intercultural interactions. These play an important role in the design practices hence design issues can differ in each project. Therefore this thesis will evaluate today’s architectural and urban design practices in waterfront regeneration in the framework of cross-culturalism. The final variation between the four case studies lies in the outcomes. While London, Hamburg and Genoa are considered successes which exemplify their generations, Izmir stands apart. Izmir is a port city and it has long played an important role in <b>trans-shipments</b> in the east Mediterranean. In fact, the city of Izmir has had the identity of a port city since its establishment in 3000 BC. But the port-city identity of Izmir reached its peak in the nineteenth century, when the city became the main entrance port of Europe to Western Anatolia, especially in connection with the industrialization processes underway all around the world. In common with the other case studies, the port area of Izmir became a derelict area after de-industrialization. The industrial zone, which is directly connected with the port, was particularly heavily affected by geopolitical changes and became vacant. Industrial buildings could not adapt to the economical and global changes and so they therefore became abandoned. As with other port cities in the world, the regeneration of Izmir’s waterfront came onto the development agenda, but the project did not come into effect as was expected. This makes it different and the reasons for this will be explored. As the case studies will show, general themes can be ascribed to the decline of port city waterfronts, which can be used to make predictions for the future of port cities which have yet to undergo such transformative projects. Additionally, principles will be identified that underpin successful projects and unite them. It is the opinion of this author that valuable predictions can be made based upon this research and analysis with concrete implications for contemporary port cities like Izmir, which are as yet to complete the process of transformation. These elements and the arguments supporting them are drawn together in the conclusions and suggestions made in the fourth chapter where a general view and suggestions for a better future direction of European waterfront regenerations will be provided. The importance of waterfront regeneration projects both in architectural history and for the future will be emphasized. Finally, the fourth chapter additionally highlights the importance of waterfront regeneration projects in the context of architectural history, suggesting that the analysis of such projects enhances scientific study. This indicates that research invested in the planning and design stages of a project is necessary for the effective development of a waterfront area. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated. Shipping goods in the form of infrequent but very large loads involves engaging more idle capital in the form of stock than the alternatives. Also, the process of <b>trans-shipment</b> is costly. The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the [...] "just-in-time" [...] approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late 1970s had a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the use of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned. Thus, by the late 1970s, the local Gulf operating company (Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd) was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company was forced to undertake a number of cost-saving measures.|$|E

40|$|African and Caribbean {{countries}} {{pioneered the}} export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial {{share of the market}} to new exporters from Latin America and Asia. Many ACP countries have the climate, soils, water resources and the skills to produce quality products: a determined effort is needed to win back a larger share of what is now an expanding market. Fruit and vegetable production has a multiple role in ACP countries: as a source of food for local markets and for export; as a provider of employment and as a source of foreign exchange. A majority of countries would benefit from increasing their production of horticultural crops. This would raise national nutritional levels and provide a larger production base from which the best quality produce could be selected for export. Several African and Caribbean countries are already engaged in exporting what at first appear to be large quantities of fruit and vegetables: Cote d'Ivoire produces 20, 000 tonnes of mangoes, 200, 000 tonnes of pineapples and 1. 5 million tonnes of bananas each year, mostly for export; the Caribbean is also a major exporter of bananas, Kenya has developed exports of pineapples and French beans, Zambia exports mangetout peas, Burkina Faso exports mangoes and Madagascar exports litchis. However, in world trade terms ACP exports to the EC are both relatively small and heavily reliant on fruit, particularly bananas. Of the nine million tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables imported into the EC in 1990, 96 % was fruit ando nly 10 % (920, 000 tonnes) was from ACP States. Of this, 46 % came from the Caribbean, 39 % from West and Central Africa and 15 % from East Africa and the Indian Ocean and Pacific States. If bananas, on which the Caribbean countries are highly dependent, are excluded, the total tonnage exported by ACP States was 300, 000 tonnes (3. 3 % of total EC imports), of which only 40, 000 tonnes (0. 45 %) were vegetables. How competitors succeed ACP countries obviously face keen competition, in particular from Central, South American and Asian countries but also from the Mediterranean region. Under the Lome Convention ACP agricultural and horticultural exports have enjoyed an advantage, entering the EC without the tariffs levied on many products from non-ACP producers. But with the eventual prospect of a single market within the EC and the removal of tariffs, ACP exporters must be prepared to produce fruit and vegetables of the highest quality at a competitive price and to supply a consistent volume. Mediterranean and Near-East countries have lower transport costs, being closer to Europe, but Asian and Latin American exporters are more distant than those in Africa. The success of Asian and Latin American exporters has been based on thorough market research to identify consumer preferences, funding of research to develop new, high yielding, flavoursome and visually attractive varieties, and disciplined production and investment in cold storage, transport and marketing promotion. The mango is a fruit which has enormous potential in the European market yet the ACP share of EC imports has dropped from 40 % in 1981 to 18 % in 1990. Meanwhile Central and South American countries, notably Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have increased their market share in the same period from 36 % to 61 %. These countries are able to supply the European market for six months of the year, long enough to build up a good business relationship with European importers, whereas the ACP season is much shorter. Major exporters are also constantly monitoring the market and are prepared to abandon varieties or product lines if they recognise that consumer demand is changing or if a competitor develops an unassailable advantage. They are also flexible enough to develop new products rapidly. Meeting the challenge At present 70 % of ACP fruit supply to the EC consists of bananas: pineapple, citrus and coconut make up a further 27 %. All other fruit, i. e. 25, 000 tonnes, comprises only 3 % of the total. Research into the opportunities for extending this 'basket of fruit' needs to be undertaken. COLEACP, the marketing organization responsibile for trade links between ACP countries and the EC is able to assist with advice and market information. The Deputy Director, Mme C. Guichard, believes that challenges can be met and cites several successful examples, particularly {{the export of}} avocado and kiwifruit. Several African and Caribbean countries have risen to the challenges posed by aggressive competitors. Kenya has developed horticultural exports, including French beans, strawberries, avocado, pineapple and carnations, which are now worth US$ 16 million/year. With the decline in coffee prices these products have become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe has developed profitable export of mangoes, strawberries, bananas, grapes, citrus and kiwifruit. Cote d'Ivoire has long been a major exporter of pineapples and Ghana is trying now to emulate its neighbour. Burkina Faso exports French beans and mango. Madagascar exports 4200 tonnes of litchis per year 1000 tonnes by air and 3200 tonnes by sea; with an annual production of 35 - 40, 000 tonnes, there is ample scope for increasing the proportion exported. The Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit of the Eastern Caribbean States, based in Dominica, is actively pursuing a diversification programme to reduce dependence on bananas, coconut and limes and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) is undertaking research to broaden the base of varieties of passion fruit and citrus grown in member countries, and to develop pro auction of new product lines including carambola, soursop and sapodilla. Unfortunately fruit and vegetable research has not been given a high priority in ACP countries over the last 30 years and also there has been a lack of training in horticulture. Dr Linda Wickham, Assistant Dean of Research at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad, believes that research, particularly in the field of post-harvest technology, is essential. She also recognizes the need to educate producers in the Caribbean to recognize that their own criteria for selection of produce - knowledge of keeping and cooking quality and taste rather than appearance - are not those of consumers in Europe, whose priorities are attractive visual appearance, consistent size and absence of blemishes. However, researching new varieties is only a beginning. The European consumer not only has considerable buying power but is also becoming increasingly selective. It is therefore essential that any country wishing to enter that market must ensure that there is a regular supply of consistently high quality produce in pre-determined quantities and at an agreed price. Planning for expansion While there is an urgent need to find new varieties, and even new crops, it is essential that due care is taken not to introduce diseases or pests during transfer of seed or vegetative planting materials. Quarantine regulations must be applied and both exporting and importing countries, as well as farmers, must take responsibility for ensuring exchange of clean planting materials. Pineapple nematodes were accidentally introduced into Ghana when growers embarked on an accelerated programme of planting improved varieties developed elsewhere in the region. Tissue culture, or aerial root propagating material, would have avoided this problem but there are no facilities for tissue culture in Ghana as yet. Sites for new plantations must be chosen with care. Mango plantations, for example, should not be established in humid zones where disease will always remain a problem. And for export crops, the distance between farm and port of exit should not be more than 100 km in order to avoid long haulage and the inevitable bruising that results. Increasingly, crops will have to be grown with very strict control over pesticide usage, especially just before or after harvest. With consumer pressure to reduce pesticide residues in food commodities and the tightening of EC laws concerning residues, alternatives to existing spraying regimes and post-harvest treatments must be developed: for example integrated pest management systems incorporating cultural and biological control measures. In the whole chain of production from grower to consumer {{one of the most critical}} links to protect quality is post-harvest storage. For tropical and sub-tropical produce the use of chilling facilities to remove field-heat and to maintain low temperatures during storage and transport is essential. However, the temperatures involved are critical and without reliable equipment and power supplies and well trained staff, all the investment in production may be lost between field or orchard and the supermarket shelf. Nearly every exporter in Zimbabwe has on-farm coldstore facilities to remove field-heat by pre-cooling and storing at the optimum temperature to prevent physiological deterioration. And there has been heavy investment in insulated trucks and cold stores at the airport for holding produce in transit. Multiple retailers (supermarkets) are expanding their share of the retail market throughout the EC and in the UK they now represent 50 % of retail distribution. The demands set by the multiples on their suppliers are high, not only in terms of quality of the product, but also on reliability of supply, volume and delivery schedule. They also expect standards of hygiene adopted by food processing industries and, where fruit or vegetables are being pre-packed, it is essential that the packhouse environment, workers' clothing and hands and any water used for washing all meet the highest standards of public health. Wherever air cargo capacity is available and prices are competitive, airfreight will be preferred for exporting perishable produce. However exporters should target only those countries served by direct flights; when consignments are trans-shipped onto a second flight they are inevitably subjected to a 3 - 5 hour period on the tarmac awaiting loading. In addition, the 'last-on' port of any cargo is vulnerable to last-minute offloads and trans-shipped consignments are the least likely to be put into coldstore facilities at an intermediate airport. Seafreight is a lower cost alternative for less perishable products but again temperature, and even the gases in the atmosphere, have to be controlled. Packaging must also be stronger in order to survive longer journey times, dockside <b>trans-shipments</b> and road or rail distribution on arrival in Europe. Finally, exporters should be aware of changes in packaging regulations in EC member countries. For instance, suppliers to Germany must use only standard pallets and these must be recyclable wherever possible. Where non-returnable pallets are used, they may be made only of untreated wood. Packaging must not include a mix of paper and plastic nor should toxic inks be used. Similar regulations are likely to be implemented throughout the EC. Worth the trouble? Competition is fierce and the standards demanded are high. It will not be easy for ACP countries to maintain, let alone increase, their share of fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. It may also appear easier for large-scale producers to manage production, storage, transport and marketing rather than farmers on smaller acreages. However, the rewards for successful exporters will be a share of a still-expanding market and foreign exchange to make up for reduced income from more traditional exported commodities, many of which are now in over-supply. Countries such as Kenya, Mauritius (see box) and Zimbabwe have also proved that a wide range of horticultural products can be grown to a high standard by small-scale growers: over 80 % of Kenyan producers are small-scale farmers who, with effective technical services provided by government and the private sector, are prepared to accept the challenge of producing for export. Government intervention and investment does not have to be on a large scale but it must be targeted to critical areas. It can be most effective where it plays a regulatory role and facilitates growth through horticultural research, infrastructural development, incentives and support services. In addition, the EC Commission encourages joint research projects and fosters links between ACP States and between ACP States and other countries. In the past new export crops such as fruit and vegetables have often been considered by policy makers to be less important than food crops and traditional export commodities. Now it seems that the rewards for successful trading in fresh produce may be more attractive. But exporting is a team effort and government policy-makers, research scientists, commercial exporters and farmers must be prepared to work together. If serious attention can be given to market research, varietal development, coldstorage facilities, transport, flexibility and marketing promotion, ACP countries have much to gain. African and Caribbean countries pioneered the export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial share of the market to new exporters from Latin America and Asia.
