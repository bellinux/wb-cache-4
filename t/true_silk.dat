25|$|People {{who choose}} to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, grosgrain, percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, broadcloth, Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types {{including}} artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, <b>true</b> <b>silk,</b> shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|E
5000|$|Tama - bobbins. The thread is {{kept from}} {{unwinding}} by passing the thread under itself, forming a loop around the tama. <b>True</b> <b>silk</b> is a hollow fiber with a rough surface that resists slipping past the loop unless gently pulled. For synthetic fibers, a flexible plastic [...] "clamshell" [...] bobbin may be preferable.|$|E

50|$|The two families, Deinopoidea and Araneoidea, {{have similar}} {{behavioral}} sequences and spinning apparatuses to produce architecturally similar webs. The Araneidae weave <b>true</b> viscid <b>silk</b> with an aqueous glue property, and the Deinopoidea use dry fibrils and sticky silk. The Deinopoidea (including the Uloboridae), have a cribellum - a flat, complex spinning plate {{from which the}} cribellate silk is released.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to silks and satins, I am {{not going}} to pretend that they are to be found here. It is <b>true,</b> there are <b>silk</b> manufactories, like that of the Cheneys in Connecticut, where very pretty foulard dress-silks are made, {{together}} with sewing-silk enough to supply a large demand. Enough has been done to show that silks might be made in America; but at present, as compared with Europe, we claim neither silks nor thread laces among our manufactures.|$|R
40|$|The author {{declares}} {{there is}} no conflict of interest. Author’s preprint. Not for redistribution. Barratt et al. ’s article presents the first large survey to characterize buyers on the online anonymous marketplace Silk Road. At the time the survey was conducted, Silk Road was the most successful online drug marketplace. While people had been exchanging drugs online through forums, bulletin boards, and even dedicated websites for years, thanks to an ingenious combination of cryptographic tools, Silk Road offered stronger anonymity to its sellers and buyers, and facilitated the online trade of drugs on an unprecedented scale. A {{few months after the}} study was completed, Silk Road was taken down following a lengthy FBI operation. The billion-dollar amounts alleged in the criminal complaint (1) (and unfortunately echoed in Barratt et al. ’s paper) are highly inflated due to erroneous conversion rates between “bitcoins ” and US dollars, but it remains <b>true</b> that <b>Silk</b> Road was a thriving marketplace (2). More interestingly, the criminal complaint suggests that most of the operation revolved around traditional police techniques, such as infiltratio...|$|R
50|$|In 1922 Hermann Staudinger (of Worms, Germany 1881-1965) was {{the first}} to propose that {{polymers}} consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. He also proposed to name these compounds macromolecules. Before that, scientists believed that polymers were clusters of small molecules (called colloids), without definite molecular weights, held together by an unknown force. Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953. Wallace Carothers invented the first synthetic rubber called neoprene in 1931, the first polyester, and went on to invent nylon, a <b>true</b> <b>silk</b> replacement, in 1935. Paul Flory was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his work on polymer random coil configurations in solution in the 1950s. Stephanie Kwolek developed an aramid, or aromatic nylon named Kevlar, patented in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Silk {{decides to}} use Effingham, agreeing to the latter's {{beautification}} scheme for the square, but also deciding {{to tear down}} the old courthouse (and giving his brother-in-law Bill the contract to erect the new one). When Effingham learns about the plan, he fights for the courthouse’s restoration. He brings in expert Major Hickock to evaluate the condition of the building. The mayor responds by calling a town meeting, hoping that no one will show up. But Effingham alerts residents about the meeting in his column, and lots of townsfolk attend. The mayor claims the town will get 1/3 of the cost paid for by the Works Progress Administration if a new courthouse is built, but nothing for repairs. When uncomfortable questions are still asked, the mayor hastily adjourns the meeting. Effingham checks out the claims, and finds out that none of what the mayor said is <b>true.</b> <b>Silk,</b> however, refuses to call a second meeting.|$|E
40|$|TWO VENERABLE {{groups of}} spiders spin orb webs: the cnbellate Ulobon-dae, weavers of calamistrated sticky silk, and the ecribellate Araneidae, weavers of <b>true</b> viscid <b>silk</b> (Figs. 12. 2, 12. 1). "Cnbellate " spiders possess a cnbellum and a calamistrum. The cnbellum is a flat, complex {{spinning}} plate {{from which the}} cnbellate silk issues; the calamistrum is a comb of bristles on the fourth metatarsi used to comb the cnbellate silk from the cnbellum. "Ecnbellate " spiders lack these structures. Other aspects of the morphology of the two families of spiders also differ considerably, yet both groups spin very similar orb webs. When juxtaposed to the morphological disparity be-tween the spiders themselves, the similanty {{in the form of}} cheir webs and {{in the manner in which}} they are constructed has inspired a classic evolutionary controversy•the single versus the dual origin of the orb web. Behavioral evidence has defined one group, "orb weavers, " including some but not all cnbellate spiders, but morphological evidence has defined another, "Cn-bellatae, " including some but not all orb weavers. The problem can be viewed as two contingent dilemmas. First, are all orb webs homologous as orb webs, and/or all cnbella homologous as cnbella? Second, if the answer to both of these questions is yes, then which homo-loguc is primitive and which derived, or do they both define the same group? There are several possible answers to these two dilemmas, and all have been suggested at one time or another in the history of the controversy. An addi-tional problem contributing to the controversy over the orb web is second-ary loss or complete modification of features in only some species of a monophyletic group. Occasionally, the species retaining the features are split off as a separate taxon defined by the retained primitive features. That taxon is not then synonymous with any real evolutionary lineage, and i...|$|R
