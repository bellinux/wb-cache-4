40|$|We present early {{results from}} <b>the</b> Far <b>Ultraviolet</b> Space Telescope (FAUST), which flew in March 1992 with the ATLAS space shuttle mission.

Studies underway using the data obtained on this mission include establishing the brightness {{and distribution of}} far <b>ultraviolet</b> stars in <b>the</b> halo of our Galaxy, establishing <b>the</b> far <b>ultraviolet</b> properties of nearby galaxies and nearby clusters of galaxies, analyzing the diffuse galactic light, and searching for the origin of <b>the</b> extragalactic <b>ultraviolet</b> light.

The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after the burst was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
2500|$|Although optical telescopes can image <b>the</b> near <b>ultraviolet,</b> <b>the</b> {{ozone layer}} in <b>the</b> {{stratosphere}} absorbs <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation shorter than 300nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional aluminium-coated mirrors {{cannot be used}} and alternative coatings such as magnesium fluoride or lithium fluoride are used instead. The Orbiting Solar Observatory satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. <b>The</b> International <b>Ultraviolet</b> Explorer (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a [...] aperture telescope with two spectroscopes. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100nm) is a discipline {{in its own right}} and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; <b>the</b> Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> Explorer (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.|$|R

5|$|The anions in {{compounds}} with {{bonds with}} the most ionic character tend to be colourless (with an absorption band in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> part of the spectrum). In compounds with less ionic character, their colour deepens through yellow, orange, red and black (as the absorption band shifts to longer wavelengths into the visible spectrum).|$|E
5|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{of molecular}} oxygen {{is associated with}} the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere.

Precision spectroscopy in <b>the</b> extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> on helium atoms and helium+ ions is very interesting as it could provide more stringent tests of quantum electrodynamics than currently possible with hydrogen. One problem is that spectroscopy in <b>the</b> extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> typically requires amplification and harmonic upconversion of visible light sources, which can introduce difficult to control systematic errors {{as a result of}} so called frequency-chirping effects [1, 2]...|$|R
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> {{region of the}} light spectrum.

5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E

Among the objects observed were quasars, galaxy clusters, active and normal galaxies, cataclysmic variables, globular clusters, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs...|$|R

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> catastrophe, proved troublesome. Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.|$|E

40|$|The imaging {{instrumentation}} on the Dynamics Explorer 1 satellite {{has been}} used to measure the intensity of <b>the</b> diffuse <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation on two great circles about the sky.

5|$|The GHRS was a {{spectrograph}} {{designed to}} operate in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet.</b> It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000. Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, San Diego, and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through <b>the</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
