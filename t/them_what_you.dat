500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the members}} of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade at the time was Hans Friedrich. He claims not to recall exactly which actions he took part in that summer, but he does admit to {{participating}} in killings like the one in Ostrog. [...] "They were so utterly shocked and timid, you could do with <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was also}} a mentor to other women. She advised Rebecca Campbell, {{executive}} director of the Austin Film Society, [...] "Whenever you speak in public you’ve got to tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need from them." [...] She put the spotlight on film as a genuine industry, brought more focus to Texas, and had a tremendous network of people in the entertainment industry. She gave more focus to film as a business than had been done before.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now then, boys, show <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do!" [...] yelled the Colby Hall cadets, {{and then}} the school slogan rang out on the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've got {{to tighten}} up, boys!" [...] called out Fred {{to the members}} of his school team. [...] "Tighten up and show <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Rodney Stark {{argues that}} [...] "the {{fundamental}} problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis {{the morality of}} slavery is that Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: [...] "Feed <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> eat yourself and clothe them with what you wear...They are God's people like unto you and be kind unto them". In addition, Stark contrasts Islam with Christianity, implying that Christian theologians wouldn't {{have been able to}} [...] "work their way around the biblical acceptance of slavery" [...] if Jesus had owned slaves like Muhammad did.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the front}} line {{continued}} to withdraw, they appeared from the woods {{directly in front of}} Morton and then slowly took refuge behind his lines. The Confederates, still in pursuit, began to appear from the woods, allowing Stokes' battery to open fire with canister. Morton rode to the front of his troops and said, [...] "Men, you haven't much ammunition, but give <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have and then wade in on `em with the bayonets!" [...] With that, the lines were ordered to stand and open fire, putting gaps into the oncoming Confederate lines. The lines wavered and then began to withdraw. Upon seeing the success, Rosecrans order the brigade to charge forward and occupy the fields just outside the woods. The Confederates rallied three times and pressed forward again, but each time, were forced back.|$|E
2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could do, in my opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{was only}} the bath--no, she ain't really hurt,--only wet, you know. Yes, ma, I'll tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say. No, it was a pure accident. Yes; good-night, papa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir! Bust up {{the quiet}} with a {{chugging}} motor? Not on your life! You just throw {{a pair of}} socks in the old pack, and tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want for eats. I'll be ready soon 's you are." ...|$|R
5000|$|In essence, {{the above}} method {{can be seen}} as {{following}} the colloquialism [...] "Tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you're gonna tell 'em, tell <b>'em,</b> tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> told 'em" [...] with the first part referring to the introduction, the second part referring to the body, and the third part referring to the conclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say, {{about the}} one hundred and forty {{thousand}} men in Scotland, did I!' he asked with evident delight. 'That was bold.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will, dear," [...] he said, [...] "but {{let them}} lie. They {{belong to a}} dead past. It is the future which {{concerns}} us." ...|$|E

"Call <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> please, commodore; though I should prefar to call 'em the 'Debby and Dolly of Stunin'tun,' to {{anything}} else, {{for that was}} the name of the craft I lost. Well, the best of us are but frail, and the longest-winded man is no dolphin to swim with his head under water!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are ill-treating him!" [...] Phipps cried passionately. [...] "I shall go to Scotland Yard myself! I shall tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have said. I shall {{denounce}} you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be {{the best}} plan," [...] Reuben agreed; [...] "and I am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you, when I tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have undertaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] Jacob remarked thoughtfully. [...] "When they've {{bought their}} land, {{and the houses}} are {{beginning}} to materialise, you can charge <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> like for the water and lighting." ...|$|E
5000|$|The (second) {{conclusion}} {{section of}} a CRuPAC restates the introductory conclusion. It {{is important that the}} (second) conclusion not merely copy the introduction verbatim; but rather, that the second conclusion restate the introduction in a compelling manner. It is never proper to introduce new argument or rules in the conclusion. By using two conclusion sections, the CRUPAC applies the maxim: [...] "Tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you're gonna tell 'em, then tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> told 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Canuck felt {{perhaps the}} simpler joy {{that the average}} man has in any strange notion that {{he is able to}} grasp. He stopped in his walk and said: [...] "Yes, and if you was dead and went to heaven, and stayed so long you smelt, like Lazarus, and you come back and tol' <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> saw, nobody goin' believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{explain to}} these nobles and captains <b>what</b> <b>you</b> call <b>them,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are called among your own people? Shall I tell them {{something}} of your story, Mr. Ishmael?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Stewart, tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will, {{and they}} will tell you yet more in return, to show you how signally the light of grace hath been shed over me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Usanga laughed. [...] "They do {{not know}} an Englishman from a German," [...] he replied. [...] "It is nothing to <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are, except {{that you are a}} white man and an enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do. The {{boys have}} made me their captain, and as such I am bound to look after their interests. I have told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{proposed}} to do, and they don't intend to stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{stay where}} you are," [...] she said imperiously, [...] "we'll throw them overboard--when we've done with <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> did <b>you</b> say, Captain?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Answer the questions, madam, don't ask <b>them.</b> <b>What</b> are <b>you</b> doing here? Quite truthfully, if you please." [...] My {{eyes were}} fixed upon her.|$|R
6000|$|I {{heard that}} you ask'd for {{something}} to prove this puzzle the New World, [...] And to define America, her athletic Democracy, [...] Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like those monsters you chatter, [...] Friends and foes you bespatter, [...] And dirty, like <b>them,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> eat: [...] The Hollands, your muse [...] Does most grossly abuse, [...] Tho' {{you feed}} on their wine and their meat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not send}} a long letter to your friends, telling <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have told me? You can add that I {{agree that the}} {{photograph}} resembles you closely, and that you wish to talk the matter over once again with this William Dill." ...|$|E
6000|$|While {{the people}} stamped and clapped hands, Ida {{went over to}} Bradley and said: [...] "You must talk to them. Tell <b>them</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Thomas More.--Rest {{there in}} full faith. I leave {{you to your}} dreams; draw from <b>them</b> <b>what</b> comfort <b>you</b> can. And now, my friend, farewell! ...|$|R
