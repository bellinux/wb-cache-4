40|$|Despite much {{research}} in recent years, large amplitude vibrations of inclined cables {{continue to be}} of concern for cable-stayed bridges. Various excitation mechanisms have been suggested, including rain-wind excitation, dry inclined cable galloping, high reduced velocity vortex shedding and excitation from the deck and/or towers. Although {{there have been many}} observations of large cable vibrations on bridges, there are relatively few cases of direct full-scale cable vibration and wind measurements, and most research has been based on wind tunnel tests and theoretical modelling. This paper presents results from full-scale measurements on the special arrangement of <b>twin</b> <b>cables</b> adopted for the Øresund Bridge. The monitoring system records wind and weather conditions, as well as accelerations of certain cables and a few locations on the deck and tower. Using the Eigenvalue Realization Algorithm (ERA), the damping and stiffness matrices are identified for different vibration modes of the cables, with sufficient accuracy to identify changes in the total effective damping and stiffness matrices due to the aeroelastic forces acting on the cables. The damping matrices identified from the full-scale measurements are compared with the theoretical damping matrices based on the quasi-steady theory, using three different sets of wind tunnel measurements of static force coefficients on similar shaped <b>twin</b> or single <b>cables,</b> with good agreement. The damping terms are found to be dependent on Reynolds number rather than reduced velocity, indicating that Reynolds number governs the aeroelastic effects in these conditions. There is a significant drop in the aerodynamic damping in the critical Reynolds number range, which is believed {{to be related to the}} large amplitude cable vibrations observed on some bridges in dry conditions. Finally, static drag coefficients are back-calculated from the full-scale vibration measurements, for first time, with reasonable agreement with direct wind tunnel measurements. The remaining discrepancies are believed to be due to the higher turbulence intensity on site than in the wind tunnel...|$|R

However, they do not appear ever to have been widely used, although the idea has resurfaced and been refined from time to time. In the early 2000 ’s, self-equalizing conductors consisting of solid magnetic steel cores coated with silver were developed by W. L. Gore, and used in their 2. 5 Gb/s “Eye-Opener” cables, although higher speed versions never appeared. We have revived the original 1929 idea, proposing to use glass as a solid insulating core. This technology can potentially work at frequencies of many 10 ’s of GHz. Possible uses include short range GHz links such as USB and Thunderbolt, and intra-rack interconnections in data centers.

The performance of these experimental <b>twin</b> lead <b>cables</b> corresponds to calculations, confirming the general principle. By calculation, we have compared the performance of cables made from copper-on-insulator conductors to that of similar cables made with solid copper conductors, and verified that copper-on-insulator cables have significantly less frequency dependent loss.

The cable transmission of data from a scintilla tion camera to a digital computer over long distances presents problems.

40|$|Rockbolting {{telltales}} are now {{an internationally}} established means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The dual height telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the rockbolted height, is the most widespread version. The dual height telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as rockbolting was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height telltales are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading dual height telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic telltales to be connected with a <b>twin</b> core <b>cable</b> and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{maintenance}} works (e. g. inspection, repair) of aero-engines while still attached on the airframes requires a desirable approach since this can significantly shorten both {{the time and}} cost of such interventions as the aerospace industry commonly operates based on the generic concept “power by the hour”. However, navigating and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as gas turbine engines is a challenging task. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a highly flexible slender (i. e. low diameter-to-length ratios) continuum robot of 25 degrees of freedom capable to uncoil from a drum to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into crammed environments and then perform, with its last 6 DoF, complex trajectories with a camera equipped machining end-effector for allowing in-situ interventions at a low-pressure compressor of a gas turbine engine. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronics solutions such as: (i) <b>twin</b> commanding <b>cables</b> to minimise the number of actuators; (ii) twin compliant joints to enable large bending angles (± 90 °) arranged on a tapered structure (start from 40 mm to 13 mm at its end); (iii) feeding motion provided by a rotating drum for coiling/uncoiling the continuum robot; (iv) machining end-effector equipped with vision system. To be able to achieve the in-situ maintenance tasks, a set of innovative control algorithms to enable the navigation and end-effector path generation have been developed and implemented. Finally, the continuum robot has been tested both for navigation and movement of the end-effector against a specified target within a gas turbine engine mock-up proving that: (i) max. deviations in navigation from the desired path (1000 mm length with bends between 45 ° and 90 °) are ± 10 mm; (ii) max. errors in positioning the end-effector against a target situated at the end of navigation path is 1 mm. Thus, this paper presents a compact continuum robot that could be considered as a step forward in providing aero-engine manufacturers with a solution to perform complex tasks in an invasive manner...|$|R
