5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. Moulting {{does not occur}} in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the eggs on their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The {{age of a}} few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E

25|$|After further feeding, the J2s undergo {{morphological}} {{changes and}} become saccate. Without further feeding, they moult {{three times and}} eventually become adults. In females, which are close to spherical, feeding resumes and the reproductive system develops. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> an adult female may extend to three months, and many hundreds of eggs can be produced.

25|$|Neutrophils are {{the most}} {{abundant}} white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes. They defend against bacterial or fungal infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form pus. They are {{commonly referred to as}} polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands. This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their lysosomes (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens. Neutrophils {{are the most}} common cell type seen {{in the early stages of}} acute inflammation. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> a circulating human neutrophil is about 5.4 days.|$|E
25|$|Evidence-based studies {{indicate}} that <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices. For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men—as of 2013 the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated at 70.2 years compared to 66.1 for a boy. There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development—for example life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 84.8years for girls and 78.9 for boys, while in Swaziland, primarily because of AIDS, it is 31.3years for both sexes. The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40years. In the developing world the median age is between 15 and 20years. While one in five Europeans is 60years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60years of age or older. The number of centenarians (humans of age 100years or older) {{in the world was}} estimated by the United Nations at 210,000 in 2002. At least one person, Jeanne Calment, is known to have reached the age of 122years; higher ages have been claimed but they are not well substantiated.|$|E

500|$|Female Pacific blue-eyes {{are sexually}} mature at {{six months of}} age or when they have reached [...] in {{standard}} length. Males are mature at [...] standard length. A study published in 2003 showed that males will preferentially choose larger females—who are more fecund as a rule—unless more energy is required to do so, such as swimming further against a current. Fish can breed in fresh and salt water. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> the species is around 1–2 years in the wild, and around 2–3 years in aquariums, though some males may reach 4 years of age. In an aquarium, Pacific blue-eyes spawn in gravel or moss {{at the base of}} aquatic plants. An experiment housing Pacific blue-eyes and mosquitofish together showed that growth and breeding of the former fish were severely affected by the presence of the latter. The mechanism was unclear—there were some signs of direct aggression (bite marks on fins of Pacific blue-eyes) but stress from contact was thought to be a major factor.|$|E
500|$|There is {{difference}} of opinion among biographers regarding the year of birth of Tulsidas. Many sources rely on Veni Madhav Das' account in the Mula Gosain Charita, which gives the year of Tulsidas' birth as Vikrami Samvat 1554 (1497 CE). These sources include Shivlal Pathak, popular editions of Ramcharitmanas (Gita Press, Naval Kishore Press and Venkateshvar Press), Edwin Greaves, Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Ramanand Sarasvati, Ayodhyanath Sharma, Ramchandra Shukla, Narayandas, and Rambhadracharya. A second group of biographers led by Sant Tulsi Sahib of Hathras and Sir George Grierson give the year as Vikram 1589 (1532 CE). These biographers include Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Ramghulam Dwivedi, James Lochtefeld, Swami Sivananda and others. A third small group of authors which includes H. H. Wilson, Garse De Tasse and Krishnadatta Mishra gives the year as Vikram 1600 (1543 CE). [...] The year 1497 appears in many current-day biographies in India and in popular culture. Biographers who disagree with this year argue that it makes <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> Tulsidas equal 126 years, which in their opinion is unlikely if not impossible. In contrast, Ramchandra Shukla says that an age of 126 is not impossible for a Mahatma (great soul) like Tulsidas. The Government of India and provincial governments celebrated the 500th birth anniversary of Tulsidas in the year 2011 CE, according to the year of Tulsidas' birth in popular culture.|$|E
500|$|The pygmy slow loris can {{conceive}} by 18 {{months and}} {{give birth to}} its first offspring by two years of age. Studbook records show that the youngest male to sire offspring was around 18 months of age, and the youngest female conceived at 16 months. Gestation length is 184–200 days, and the lactation period lasts 123–146 days. Offspring are weaned at about 24 weeks of age. The pygmy slow loris is monoestrous, experiencing a single four- to five-day period of reproductive activity between late July and early October in captivity, with births occurring from early February to mid-March. As a result, opportunities for mating are rare, and females rely heavily on scent to assess mate quality. Females show a strong preference for familiar-smelling males over novel-smelling males. Research {{on the process of}} sexual selection in primates suggests that the exclusive presence of one male's scent in the area is a reliable cue that he is capable of defending the area and/or preventing rival males from marking. Pygmy slow lorises usually have a litter size of one or two; separate studies have reported frequencies of twinning as either 50% or 100% of births. Data collected from a seven-year captive breeding program indicates that they have a skewed birth sex ratio of 1 female to 1.68 males. Because they must divide time equally between offspring, mothers of twins spend less time engaging in social grooming and play with their young, which may lead to a lower infant survival rate. Mothers will [...] "park" [...] their young at one week of age while foraging, and the young begin following their mothers at about two weeks. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> the pygmy slow loris is about 20 years.|$|E
