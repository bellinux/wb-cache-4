He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E

He’s ridiculous, he lies, but he is brave and does know the waters. And for once we hear Stephen and Jack discuss him, because he’s not a shipmate so Stephen doesn’t feel like an informer <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He’s a psychological curiosity without any doubt, and O’Brian does him very well. There’s also the flogging Captain Corbett—so among his little fleet there’s one dandy and one tartar, and Jack has to try to manage them diplomatically." ...|$|E

[...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit I was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E
