40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services has {{identified}} breast cancer {{as the most}} common malignant neoplasm among women in Wisconsin. To determine the potential effectiveness of a program of low-cost screening mammography in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality in individuals of low socioeconomic status, the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of data from <b>tumor</b> <b>registries.</b> Using the <b>tumor</b> <b>registries</b> of two hospitals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the records of 323 patients with breast cancer were identified and analyzed for size of tumor at first presentation. These data were correlated with per capita income taken from census block information for the residence of each patient. The data indicate that mean income was lower for patients with more advanced disease. Other variables such as race did not influence tumor classification at initial presentation. Economically disadvantaged women present with more advanced breast cancers than affluent patients. This adverse circumstance {{may be the result}} of lack of financial resources and poor dissemination of information.

40|$|German {{hospital}} <b>tumor</b> <b>registries</b> play {{an active}} role in the treatment of cancer patients. Besides the documentation of the course of a disease, they directly support medical treatment and follow-up care over a long period. As the treatment of oncologic patients is a shared multidisciplinary task, the availability of information is one of the most valuable outputs. Therefore, the documentation has to be integrated into the medical treatment, which only can be achieved when useful services are based on it. Since 1983 the basis of the documentation has been a uniform basic data set which was revised in 1990 and, according to be requirements mentioned above, allows detailed documentation, especially of therapy. During the last four years a new documentation system for tumor diseases has been developed and was implemented in 30 hospital <b>tumor</b> <b>registries</b> by the "Arbeitsgruppe zur Koordination Klinischer Krebsregister". The so-called "Giessener Tumordokumentationssystem" (GTDS) is the basis of the work in those registries. In this paper the functions and services which were implemented in order to support the individual treatment of oncologic patients and the methods of collecting and delivering that information to the physician are presented...|$|R
40|$|Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) most {{commonly}} represents local or regional evolution of an abdominal carcinoma. Sometimes {{it can be}} synchronous with the primary tumor (primary carcinomatosis) but more often is present as recurrent disease (metachronous or secondary) after first-line treatment of the originating tumor. Patients with tumors from colon, ovary, and stomach cancer {{are more likely to}} present with PC during their clinical course. Less frequently, other abdominal malignancies, such as uterus, pancreas, small bowel, biliary, or urinary tract, can involve the peritoneum. Tumors originating from the peritoneum itself are definitely rarer: mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), primitive peritoneal carcinoma, and desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor. PC from extra-abdominal tumors, such as lung, breast, melanoma, or peritoneal sarcomatosis, is exceptional, and few epidemiological data are available on them. Statistical analysis of worldwide cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality rate is available on GLOBOCAN 2012 [1]. In Italy, most epidemiological data are available in the reports from the Italian Association of <b>Tumor</b> <b>Registries</b> (AIRTUM) [2], which collects data regarding incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates from all local and regional <b>tumor</b> <b>registries,</b> covering at least 34 % of total population.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Treatment and {{mortality}} risk were compared between prostate cancer patients receiving care in fee-for-service settings and those receiving {{care in a}} health maintenance organization (HMO). METHODS. Two samples were obtained from a population-based <b>tumor</b> <b>registry.</b> Patients in the first sample (n = 201) were interviewed shortly after diagnosis to obtain data on income, education, overall health status, and expenditures for health status, and expenditures for health care. These data were combined with information from the <b>tumor</b> <b>registry</b> on cancer stage, age, treatment, place of residence, and source of care. Only <b>tumor</b> <b>registry</b> data were obtained for most patients in the second sample (n = 962). For both samples, survival time was monitored for up to 80 months. RESULTS. Multivariate analysis of data from the interviewed sample indicated that HMO patients {{were less likely to}} receive surgery but more likely to receive radiation therapy than were those in fee-for-service settings. Mortality risk was lower for the HMO patients than for those in fee-for-service plans. Findings based on the second sample were nearly identical. CONCLUSIONS.
