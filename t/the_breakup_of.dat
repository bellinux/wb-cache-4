40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{investigating}} <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferrofluid droplet under {{magnetic fields}} in a microfluidic T-junction. <b>The</b> whole <b>breakup</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferrofluid droplets under {{uniform magnetic field}} and non-uniform magnetic field were exhaustively considered. The influence of both the flow rates and magnetic flux density on <b>the</b> formation and <b>breakup</b> were extensively studied. It was found that <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>breakup</b> process can be changed and <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> frequency <b>of</b> ferrofluid droplets can be actively modulated by applying a uniform magnetic field. While under non-uniform magnetic field, <b>the</b> asymmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> ferrofluid droplets can be realized. Both the magnetic field intensity and hydrodynamic force affect <b>the</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> process. <b>The</b> non-uniform magnetic field can exert attraction on ferrofluid droplets in a dissymmetrical way to avoid breakup...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> the Carolingian Empire was {{accompanied}} by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there {{as well as in}} Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. <b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} experimentally <b>the</b> bubble <b>breakup</b> in a microfluidic T-junction divergence using a high-speed digital camera and a micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system. <b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> and non-breakup <b>of</b> N- 2 bubbles in glycerol-water mixtures with several concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactant were studied with capillary number ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 1. The cross section of PMMA square microchannel is 400 mu m wide and 400 mu m deep. Four various flow patterns were observed at the T-junction by changing gas and liquid flow rates. The dynamics of three various types <b>of</b> symmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> bubbles were investigated. <b>The</b> symmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> bubbles type I is mainly controlled by the augmented pressure in liquid phase. <b>The</b> symmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> bubbles type II is controlled by both the increased pressure and viscous forces. In <b>the</b> symmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> bubbles type III, a scaling law for the minimum bubble neck and the remaining time during bubble breaking process were found. <b>The</b> transitions between <b>breakup</b> and non-breakup <b>of</b> bubbles were investigated, and a power-law relationship between bubble extension and capillary number was proposed to predict the transitions between adjacent regimes. Our experimental results reveal that <b>the</b> bubble <b>breakup</b> in a microfluidic T-junction divergence {{is similar to the}} droplet behaviours in such a device (Jullien et al., 2009; Leshansky and Pismen, 2009; Link et al., 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} experimental results on <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> behavior <b>of</b> liquid jets emanating from elliptical orifices with different orifice aspect ratios. The experiments {{were carried out}} in the range of mean jet velocity 0 − 5 m/s, using water as the working fluid; the liquid jets were injected vertically downward in still, ambient air. Photographic methods were employed to analyze <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid jets. <b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical orifice jets are compared with those of circular orifices with the same exit area as the elliptical orifices. The comparison shows that the liquid jets emanating from the elliptical orifice are less stable than jets from the circular orifice in a particular range of flow conditions corresponding to a √We range of 2 − 20. We attribute this enhanced instability of the elliptical jet to the axis-switching process occurring in this √We regime, a phenomenon by which the elliptical jet interchanges major and minor axes periodically as the jet flows downstream. <b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical jet resembles that of the circular jet below this range of flow conditions, and their breakup curves coincide. Above this range, the elliptical liquid jets exhibit different flow behavior from the circular jet, although their breakup curves coincide again...|$|R
