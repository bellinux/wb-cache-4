5|$|Six {{of these}} {{original}} handwritten copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six {{people who were}} most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E

25|$|Permanent {{nerve damage}} after a {{peripheral}} nerve block is rare. Symptoms {{are likely to}} resolve within a few weeks. The vast majority of those affected (92%–97%) recover within four to six weeks; 99% of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> recovered within a year. An estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October, the CDC {{confirmed}} that {{a nurse in}} Texas, Nina Pham, who had treated Duncan {{was found to be}} positive for the Ebola virus, the first known case of the disease to be contracted in the United States. On 15 October, a second Texas health-care worker who had treated Duncan was confirmed to have the virus. Both of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> since recovered.|$|E
25|$|Its use in {{children}} is generally advised against, {{although it may}} be done under the supervision of a specialist. On September 21, 2015 the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17. The investigation was initiated because some of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> experienced slowed or difficult breathing. The FDA lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication.|$|E
25|$|Between 10 and 30% {{of people}} who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The great {{majority}} of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> an underlying brain condition causing their status seizure such as brain tumor, brain infection, brain trauma, or stroke. However, people with diagnosed epilepsy who have a status seizure also have an increased risk of death if their condition is not stabilized quickly, their medication and sleep regimen adapted and adhered to, and stress and other stimulant (seizure trigger) levels controlled.|$|E

25|$|Statins {{may be less}} {{effective}} in reducing LDL cholesterol in people with familial hypercholesterolemia, especially those with homozygous deficiencies. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> defects usually in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B genes, {{both of which are}} responsible for LDL clearance from the blood. Statins are still first line treatments in familial hypercholesterolemia, although other cholesterol-reducing measures may be required. In people with homozygous deficiencies, statins may still prove helpful, albeit at high doses and in combination with other cholesterol-reducing medications.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human habitation on Lewis {{is found in}} peat samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago much of the native woodland was torched {{to make way for}} grassland to allow deer to graze. The earliest archaeological remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds. The small houses of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been found throughout the Western Isles; in particular, at Dail Mhor, Carloway. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like Calanais.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{advances}} {{are opening}} up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion {{people around the world}} who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.|$|E

25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to read everything about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who are a little weaker than him; <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve is}} home {{for more than}} 2,000 {{indigenous}} people {{and a growing number}} of migrant inhabitants. The population includes four very different and unique cultural groups: Miskito, Pech, Garifunas, and the ladino. The smaller groups, the Pech, Garifunas, and Miskito inhabitants live mostly in the north, alongside the river. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a variety of rights to the land and mostly use the land for agriculture. The smaller-scale agriculture of the Pech is easily made sustainable. Many of the largest group, the ladino, entered the reserve from the south. Conflict over land rights is a prominent source of conflict between ethnic groups. Current conflict over land rights involves non native peoples invading and threatening indigenous land owners—forcing them from their historical lands.|$|E

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.|$|E

25|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, Slavic people invaded {{northern}} Greece and {{competed with}} the Greek ethnic population of Macedonia, although over time adopting the Christian Orthodox religion and Cyrillic script from Greek Macedonians. and Slavic languages have been spoken {{in the area}} alongside Greek in the region ever since. In parts of northern Greece, in the regions of Macedonia (Μακεδονία) and Thrace (Θράκη), Slavic languages continue to be spoken by people {{with a wide range}} of self-identifications. The actual linguistic classification of these dialects is unclear, although most linguists will classify them as either Bulgarian or Macedonian Slavic taking into account numerous factors, including the resemblance and mutual intelligibility of each dialect to the standard languages (abstand), and the self-identification of the speakers themselves. As however the vast majority of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a Greek national identity, linguists will make their decisions based on abstand alone. The Slavic-speaking minority of northern Greece can be divided in two main groups: Orthodox Christians and Muslims, primarily the Pomaks of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. The latter has no reported connection to ethnic Macedonians.|$|E
500|$|According to the Augusto César Sandino Foundation, {{the most}} {{affected}} were [...] "inhabitants of small poor communities who live from diverse subsistence activities. Their houses, located beside the sea, were almost entirely destroyed. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> lost their livelihoods, poor peasants who grow basic grains {{for their own}} consumption in marginal areas, and fisherpeople {{who have lost their}} fishing equipment, boats, storage sheds and warehouses. Their already extreme poverty has been exacerbated." ...|$|E

She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.'

500|$|There {{are also}} minor {{characters}} {{spread around the}} asylum. Most of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> instructions to kill Tapp and obtain a key placed inside his chest by Jigsaw to free themselves. Some of these attackers have a Reverse Bear Trap and some have a Venus flytrap. Others are equipped with new, unique traps, and some have no traps at all. While not an attacker, a masked figure called [...] "Pighead" [...] is the antagonist. Pighead pursues Tapp around the asylum and watches over Tapp's game as per Jigsaw's instructions. At {{the end of the}} game, Pighead becomes the only boss battle.|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Babylon", Johansen {{wrote the}} lyrics {{as a tribute}} to the New York Dolls' {{following}} from outside New York City: [...] " [...] is about people who live in Babylon, Long Island, New York, who go into the city every night dressed to kill. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> to get home before sun-up, you know, like vampires that can't get caught by the sun." [...] By contrast, Spin magazine's Eric Weisbard and Craig Marks interpreted [...] "Babylon" [...] as a reference to the Biblical city of the same name because of how the song portrayed [...] "the symbol of decadence as a sanctuary". The song's subject leaves Babylon for Manhattan, where she is then hired to work in a massage parlor.|$|E
