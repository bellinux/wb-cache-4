Terry Rawlings argues that the mod scene developed when British teenagers began to reject the [...] "dull, timid, old-fashioned, and uninspired" [...] British culture around them, with its repressed and class-obsessed mentality and its [...] Mods rejected the [...] "faulty pap" [...] of 1950s pop music and sappy love songs. They aimed at being [...] "cool, neat, sharp, hip, and smart" [...] by embracing [...] "all things sexy and streamlined", especially when they were new, exciting, controversial or modern. Hebdige claims that the mod subculture came about {{as part of the}} participants' desire to understand the [...] "mysterious complexity of the metropolis" [...] and to get close to black culture of the Jamaican rude boy, because mods felt that black culture [...] "ruled the night hours" [...] and that it had more streetwise [...] "savoir faire". Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss argue that at the [...] "core of the British Mod rebellion was a blatant fetishising of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>consumer</b> culture" [...] that had [...] "eroded the moral fiber of England." [...] In doing so, the mods [...] "mocked the class system that had gotten their fathers nowhere" [...] and created a [...] "rebellion based on consuming pleasures".|$|E

For, as the tax is levied at our own custom-house, the English exporter only receives the same price as formerly, though <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>consumer</b> pays a higher one. If, therefore, there be any diminution of the quantity bought, although a larger sum of money may be actually {{laid out in the}} article, a smaller one will be due from the United States to England: this sum will no longer be an equivalent for the sum due from England to the United States for corn, the balance therefore must be paid in money. Prices will fall in England and rise in the United States; iron will fall in the English market; corn will rise in the American. The English will pay a higher price for corn, and will have smaller money incomes to buy it with; while the Americans will obtain iron cheaper, that is, its price will exceed what it previously was by less than the amount of the duty, while their means of purchasing it will be increased by the increase of their money incomes.|$|E
60|$|The {{first effect}} {{is that the}} article falls in price, and a demand arises for it abroad. This new {{exportation}} disturbs the balance, turns the exchanges, money flows into the country (which we shall suppose to be the United States), and continues to flow until prices rise. This higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export; and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the United States was {{in the habit of}} exporting. The exports will thus be diminished; {{while at the same time}} the American public, having more money, will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities. If they make use of this increased power of purchase, there will be an increase of imports; and by this, and the check to exportation, the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored. The result to foreign countries will be, that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports, and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before, but not so much cheaper as the United States herself does. I say this, being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price (cost of carriage excepted) in the United States and in other countries. The cheapness, however, of the article is not measured solely by the money-price, but by that price compared with the money-incomes of the consumers. The price is the same to the American and to the foreign consumers; but the former pay that price from money-incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals; while the latter have had their money-incomes probably diminished by the same cause. The trade, therefore, has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole, but only a portion, of the benefit which <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>consumer</b> has derived from the improvement; while the United States has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities. Thus, then, any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place, but by a general cheapening of all imported products.|$|E
