5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E

Seibal Stela 10, dating to roughly 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek' as ruler of Motul de San José, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century (ca. 849), along with Calakmul, Tikal and Seibal itself.|$|E

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels where <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> significant sections in Decay {{are dedicated to}} working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders {{can be caused}} by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
