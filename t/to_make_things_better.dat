25|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{that there is a}} third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>better</b> (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.|$|E

Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal.

500|$|After {{losing his}} first five games in charge, {{including}} a 7–0 thumping from Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, Gannon {{admitted that the}} club's finances limited his ability to change personnel. He also stated that [...] "if I didn't take the job, this club would've had a real chance of dying... I'm not proud to be {{the manager of a}} club that loses 7–0... but this is my team now... It has always been my club, so it's my responsibility <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>better,</b> and over time we will." [...] He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3–2 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The [...] "Hatters" [...] secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1–1 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return. Stockport finished the campaign in 16th place, 10 points above the drop and 20 points below the play-off zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} situation when his reign began was agitated. He {{made it even}} worse by repeating the same mistake as his predecessors: he supported only one political party.

6000|$|He {{paused and}} resumed. [...] "A {{number of things}} have helped to change the {{opinions}} in which I grew up and in which you have grown up. There were worries at Princhester; I didn't let you know much about them, but there were. There was something harsh and cruel in that atmosphere. I saw for the first time--it's a lesson I'm still only learning--how harsh and greedy rich people and employing people are to poor people and working people, and how ineffective our church was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>better.</b> That struck me. There were religious disputes in the diocese too, and they shook me. I thought my faith was built on a rock, and I found it was built on sand. It was slipping and sliding long before the war. But the war brought it down. Before the war such {{a lot of things}} in England and Europe seemed like a comedy or a farce, a bad joke that one tolerated. One tried half consciously, half avoiding the knowledge of what one was doing, to keep one's own little circle and life civilized. The war shook all those ideas of isolation, all that sort of evasion, down. The world is the rightful kingdom of God; we had left its affairs to kings and emperors and suchlike impostors, to priests and profit-seekers and greedy men. We were genteel condoners. The war has ended that. It thrusts into all our lives. It brings death so close--A fortnight ago twenty-seven people were killed and injured within a mile of this by Zeppelin bombs.... Every one loses some one.... Because through all that time men like myself were going through our priestly mummeries, abasing ourselves to kings and politicians, when we ought to have been crying out: 'No! No! There is no righteousness in the world, there is no right government, except it be the kingdom of God.'" ...|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000.

60|$|So I am {{content to}} tell my simple story, without trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> seem <b>better</b> than they were; {{dreading}} nothing, indeed, but falsity, which, in spite of one's best efforts, {{there is reason to}} dread.

60|$|Now it has {{appeared}} to me unfair that humanity should be engaged perpetually in calling all those things bad which have been good enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> other <b>things</b> <b>better,</b> in everlastingly kicking down the ladder by which it has climbed.

I have found that every man is disposed to call the green leaf of the tree a little less green than it is, and the snow of Christmas a little less white than it is; therefore I have imagined that the main business of a man, however humble, is defence.
