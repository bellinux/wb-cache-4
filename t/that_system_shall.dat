40|$|We {{study the}} quantum {{properties}} and gravitational field of a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has oscillations in time. Treating {{time as a}} dynamical variable, we first construct a wave with 4 -vector amplitude that has matters vibrating in space and time. By analyzing its Hamiltonian density equation, we find <b>that</b> such <b>system</b> <b>shall</b> {{be treated as a}} quantized field. This quantized real scalar field obeys the Klein-Gordon equation and has properties resemble a zero spin bosonic field. In addition, the particle observed has oscillation in proper time. By neglecting all quantum effects and assuming the particle as a classical object that can remain stationary in space, we show that the spacetime geometry around the proper time oscillation has properties similar to the Schwarzschild gravitational field of a point mass in relativity.

The overload, {{in contrast to the}} faults, can be predicted; it is due to an improper use of equipment, showing a lack of planning. An analysis of surgery operation types by monitoring their electrical load diagrams is important to identify eventual overloads risks, which involve the automatic disconnection. The implementation, by simulation programs, of different set of ME equipment is possible after a recording campaign of every ME equipment load diagrams, present in the operating rooms ORs. The authors suggest defining an electrical classification of surgery operation types in relation to the overload risk, independent and complementary to the medical classification...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} in the {{creation}} of such a system we may profit by the example of Germany; we may do more, we may improve upon the example of Germany. The German Exchanges, though co-ordinated and encouraged to some extent by State and Imperial Governments, are mainly municipal in their scope. Starting here with practically a clear field and with the advantage of the experiment and the experience of other lands to guide us, we may begin upon a higher level and upon a larger scale. There is {{reason to believe that the}} utility of a system like Labour Exchanges, like utility of any other market, increases in proportion to its range and scope.

40|$|Abstract. The {{vision of}} Semantic Web {{services}} is <b>that</b> computer <b>systems</b> <b>shall</b> find eligible services autonomously. This can be realised with providing semantic description about advertised and requested services. In this scenario a so-called matchmaker finds matches between service requirements and advertisements {{according to their}} description. Based on the ontology language DAML+OIL a proposal for an upper ontology for the semantic description of services called DAML-S exists already. Also, approaches were introduced, which act as matchmakers for DAML-S descriptions. The contribution of this work is a new algorithm, which ranks the level of matching for DAML-S descriptions. To determine the different degrees of matching, elements of the DAML-S description are considered and matched individually. With ranking a criterion is available to select a service among a large set of results. Consider the result of flat matchmaking that consists {{of a set of}} matching and another set of non-matching services. If an autonomous system must still choose one of the set of matching services. An ordered list of services provides a decision support to autonomously choose the best service possible. ...|$|R

The evaluation is based upon "time optimization" which provides the innovative progress of management activities. The components forming this catchword are integrated as "Agility of Management Performances" {{and this is the}} central target concept of business process innovation. The progress of IT provides some new system architecture ("Web 2. 0 ", "SNS", "UBIQUITOUS", etc). Going along these currents, it is assumed <b>that</b> modern management <b>system</b> <b>shall</b> be re-built as "High degree distributed business system".

40|$|How {{to build}} robust-and-evolvable {{resilient}} software systems? On the one hand, evolvability implies a system’s ability to reach autonomously new, possibly unprecedented conditions and states; {{on the other}} hand, resilience and robustness refer to feature persistence {{in the face of}} perturbations and changes such as the ones brought about by system evolution. How to address such problem? How to make sure <b>that</b> a software <b>system</b> <b>shall</b> exhibit emerging properties such as reliability or safety irrespective of its environmental conditions and whatever its new configuration may be? In this paper we discuss these problems leveraging from three cases of adaptive software and systems designs. Our conclusions are that the complexity and characteristics of the system components in control of evolution as well as the forms of interaction of the systems with their environments {{play a key role in}} the ultimate emergence of sought properties and behaviours. Moreover we highlight how social eco-systems in heterarchical organisation appear to have a stronger resilience and robustness throughout their evolutions...|$|R
