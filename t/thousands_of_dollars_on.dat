500|$|Union Station Associates spend {{hundreds}} of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>on</b> a full {{renovation of the}} building for combined use by Amtrak and commercial tenants. The exterior was restored to the original 1885 specifications. However, some of the interior work modified the station far from its original configuration. A mezzanine was built over half the waiting area to provide restaurant seating, and {{the floor of the}} rest was cut out to create an atrium. The basement became the passenger waiting area, with a newsstand and a plant shop occupying additional space. New, wider platforms were built to improve the boarding experience. The renovated station was celebrated and rededicated in July 1976. The New London Day, which five years before called the station an [...] "eyesore", ran their coverage under the headline [...] "We were wrong!" [...] New London Union Station was the first station in the country to be restored for Amtrak use. It represented a [...] "watershed" [...] in historic preservation {{as one of the first}} industrial age structures in New England to be reused – a shift away from the previous attitude that valued only Colonial buildings – as well as the recognition of the historic value of the old downtowns of New England's port cities.|$|E

2500|$|Welsh {{retired from}} boxing after a defeat by Archie Walker in 1922, but {{retired as a}} wealthy man. Before he lost to Leonard in 1917, Welsh bought a farm on Long Hill in Chatham Township, New Jersey. The farm was set in [...] and Welsh spent <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>on</b> improvements, {{installing}} a gymnasium, {{a state of the}} art kitchen, golf course, tennis courts and a swimming pool. His idea was {{to turn it into a}} health spa, and on 11 August 1917 a host of celebrities and dignitaries were invited to its opening. One of the guests, Bat Masterson, described Long Hill as a 'palatial home sitting high upon a hill, like an acropolis'.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{followed}} the fight when Jones demanded that his loss be [...] "overturned to a disqualification victory, citing illegal use of hand wraps." [...] Jones labelled Green a cheater and filed a formal complaint to the NSW Combat Sports Authority (NSWCSA). In the {{months following the}} fight, Jones also claimed that the referee stopped the fight too early. In March 2010 Green responded to the allegations with {{an open letter to}} Jones, stating [...] "THE hand wraps were the same wraps I used in five previous world title fights, in Germany, Montreal, Australia ..." [...] and [...] "MY hand wraps were personally inspected by three independent inspectors of the NSW Combat Sports Authority and they each certified that my wraps were legal and gave me no advantage whatsoever." [...] The NSWCSA dismissed the matter, however Green claimed that he had [...] "spent tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>on</b> legal representation and fees in an attempt to protect myself from unsubstantiated claims that should've been ignored from the outset." [...] Green also claimed that the [...] "unnecessary investigation ... ruined his chance to promote a lucrative 'super bout' against the legendary Bernard Hopkins in Sydney" [...] and urged the state premier Kristina Keneally to [...] "launch an investigation into the Combat Sports Authority." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} just about when those fellers had their houses built," [...] quoth California. [...] "That one yonder {{wanted to be}} Italian, and his {{architect}} built him what he wanted. The new houses with the low straddle roofs and windows pitched in sideways and red brick walls are Dutch. That's the latest idea. I can read {{the history of the}} town." [...] I had no occasion so to read. The natives were only too glad and too proud to tell me. The hotel walls bore a flaming panorama of Tacoma in which by the eye of faith I saw a faint resemblance to the real town. The hotel stationary advertised that Tacoma bore on its face all the advantages of the highest civilisation, and the newspapers sang the same tune in a louder key. The real-estate agents were selling house-lots on unmade streets miles away for <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b> <b>On</b> the streets--the rude, crude streets, where the unshaded electric light was fighting with the gentle northern twilight--men were babbling of money, town lots, and again money--how Alf or Ed had done such and such a thing that had brought him so much money; and round the corner in a creaking boarded hall the red-jerseyed Salvationists were calling upon mankind to renounce all and follow their noisy God. The men dropped in by twos and threes, listened silently for a while, and as silently went their way, the cymbals clashing after them in vain. I think it was the raw, new smell of fresh sawdust everywhere pervading the air that threw upon me a desolating homesickness. It brought back in a moment all remembrances of that terrible first night at school when the establishment has been newly whitewashed, and a soft smell of escaping gas mingles with the odour of trunks and wet overcoats. I was a little boy, and the school was very new. A vagabond among collarless vagabonds, I loafed up the street, looking into the fronts of little shops where they sold slop shirts at fancy prices, which shops I saw later described in the papers as [...] "great." [...] California had gone off to investigate on his own account, and presently returned, laughing noiselessly. [...] "They are all mad here," [...] he said, [...] "all mad. A man nearly pulled a gun on me because I didn't agree with him that Tacoma was going to whip San Francisco on the strength of carrots and potatoes. I asked him to tell me what the town produced, and I couldn't get anything out of him except those two darned vegetables. Say, what do you think." ...|$|E

5000|$|Twarda’s {{hiring of}} one Reform Rabbi who {{is under the}} {{supervision}} of the Orthodox rabbi was met with skepticism in the entire Jewish world. The hiring of one Reform Rabbi after twenty years of fifteen or so Orthodox rabbis suggested not change, but a calculated attempt to pursue policies that served the Orthodox establishment and not the needs of Polish Jews. This has resulted in <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> expended <b>on</b> lawyers.|$|R

40|$|In today’s parallel, heterogeneous, and {{interconnected}} IT landscape, predicting {{and controlling}} the cost factors surrounding systems performance and capacity planning may seem overwhelming to many organizations. For larger IT projects, {{it is not}} uncommon to experience scenarios where the cost factors for performance tuning and capacity planning reflect the largest and the least controlled expenses. To illustrate, a sudden slowdown of an enterprise wide application may trigger user complaints, delayed projects, an IT support backlog, and ultimately a financial loss to the organization. By the time the performance problem is located, analyzed, worked around, tested, and verified, an organization may have spent tens <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in time, IT resources, and hardware, only to fall back into the same vicious cycle in the near future. The rather complex IT environment in most organizations today is normally considered the culprit to effectively tackle performance issues. The argument made here is that performance has to be designed into the final solution (hardware and software wise). This approach requires shifting the emphasis away from the installation and setup phase to the planning and design stages. It is paramount that organizations not only understand the expected workload behavior, but act upon accordingly by conducting feasibility and design studies prior to spending <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>on</b> a solution that in a best case scenario, may not be optimal, and in a worst case scenario, just dose not work...|$|R
