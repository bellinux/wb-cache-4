5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take {{up to two years}} to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty <b>thousand</b> <b>words.</b> After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E

40|$|Vocabulary is {{the basic}} {{component}} in learning English. Vocabulary carries the meaning by which a message is passed to a listener in communication. Therefore, learning vocabulary of a target language placed an important role for the learners in order to communicate well in the target language. “Bahasa Inggris” is an English e-textbook provided by The Ministry of Education and Culture {{in line with the}} implementation of Curriculum 2013. As this is a new book it is important for teachers to get information about the content of the book. The vocabulary in the book that the students use is important also. In this case, teachers should also know the vocabulary presented in the book and their level of difficulty. Therefore, the writer is interested to analyze the vocabulary level of this e-textbook. For her thesis, the writer chose to analyze the vocabulary level of “Bahasa Inggris” e-textbook for Grade XII. The writer analyzed four kinds of content words, i. e. : nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The analysis covers what words are used, the frequency of each word, and the level of difficulty of each words based on the General Service List. General Service List covering the first one <b>thousand</b> <b>word</b> list, the second one <b>thousand</b> <b>word</b> list, and the above second one <b>thousand</b> <b>word</b> list. As such, this is a descriptive qualitative research. 	The findings of the study show that there are more nouns than the other three content words analyzed. This book presents more nouns of the above second one <b>thousand</b> <b>word</b> list. This means that there are more nouns of the lower frequency. The other three content words: verbs, adjectives, and adverbs found in the book are more of the first and the second one <b>thousand</b> <b>word</b> lists. It can be concluded that the book is somewhat difficult for the students to reach the basic competence requiring more high frequency word...|$|R

500|$|Before {{starting}} a book Wodehouse would write {{up to four}} hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that [...] "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes {{such a long time}} to work one out." [...] He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty <b>thousand</b> <b>words,</b> which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that [...] "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." [...] He preferred working between 4 and 7pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three <b>thousand</b> <b>words</b> a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while Bachelors Anonymous, published in 1973, took around six months.|$|E

500|$|Advertisements {{stated that}} Nebula was [...] "Scotland's first S.F. magazine!!" [...] Several British science fiction fans helped Hamilton with the {{production}} of the magazine, including Ken Slater, Vin¢ Clarke, and John Brunner. [...] William F. Temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts. [...] Hamilton provided all the financing, but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next. [...] In addition, Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print Nebula, so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule. [...] After a dozen issues, the conflicts led to Hamilton moving Nebula to a printing firm based in Dublin, and breaking the connection with Crownpoint. [...] He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule, although the planned bi-monthly issues were still sometimes delayed. Hamilton paid 21 shillings (£1.05) per <b>thousand</b> <b>words,</b> the equivalent of three tenths of a cent per word; this was a low rate compared to the American market, but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine Authentic Science Fiction, which paid £1 per <b>thousand</b> <b>words.</b> [...] Hamilton offered a bonus of £2 or £5 to the story {{that turned out to be}} the readers' favourite in each issue, which helped attract writers; and he later increased the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 cents) per word for well-known authors. [...] This was higher than the best UK markets, such as New Worlds, and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time. [...] Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to Nebula before trying the other magazines.|$|E

500|$|This {{correlation}} {{found in}} the [...] "Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar" [...] between Abraham 1:11–2:9 and the Small Sensen papyrus has thus led many critics to assert {{that all of the}} Book of Abraham text most likely came entirely from Smith's interpretation of the Small Sensen papyrus, rather than a hypothetical lost section (as is often asserted by apologists). This means, however, that Smith likely used a single Egyptian character to derive dozens of words. Jerald Tanner, for instance, wrote “Joseph Smith apparently translated many English words from each Egyptian character. The characters from fewer than four lines of the papyrus make up forty-nine verses of the Book of Abraham, containing more than two <b>thousand</b> <b>words.</b> If Joseph Smith continued to translate the same number of English words from each Egyptian character, this one small fragment would complete the entire text of the Book of Abraham.

500|$|In early 1954, Scion were fined heavily for {{publishing}} a pornographic gangster novel. [...] Key Scion staff decided {{to restart the}} company under the name Scion Distributors, with Paterson continuing as editor. [...] The magazine format was changed from pulp to digest with the May 1954 issue—the first from the new company. [...] Scion Distributors had also acquired Scion's debts when they restarted the company, and this included a large debt to the printers, Dragon Press. [...] Scion gave Dragon Press control of the magazine with the December 1954 issue as payment for the debt, along with the novels they had rights to and their contract with Fearn. [...] Paterson resigned and Fearn took his place, insisting when he did so that his pseudonym {{be removed from the}} magazine's title. [...] It was renamed The British Science Fiction Magazine from the September 1954 issue. [...] In the opinion of sf historians Philip Harbottle and Stephen Holland, the quality of the magazine began to improve significantly, with stories by E.C. Tubb, Kenneth Bulmer, Fearn himself, and Barrington Bayley, whose first story, [...] "Combat's End", had appeared in the May 1954 issue. [...] However, sf historian Mike Ashley suggests that despite Fearn's efforts, only the E.C. Tubb stories, published under the pseudonym [...] "George Holt", were a noticeable improvement in quality. [...] When the circulation began to fall, Dragon Press quickly cut Fearn's budget in half, from 25 shillings to only 12/6 per <b>thousand</b> <b>words.</b> [...] This was half the word rate on offer at other British science fiction magazines of the era, and left Fearn unable to compete for the best stories. [...] Fearn printed material of his own that he had been unable to sell elsewhere, and was also able to save some money by reprinting stories of his that had originally appeared in the U.S. magazines. [...] More money was saved by changing the format to paperback size, and simplifying and standardizing the cover design. [...] The magazine struggled on until early 1956, when a printers strike caused Dragon Press to fold. [...] The last issue appeared in January 1956.|$|E
