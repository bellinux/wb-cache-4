5|$|In 1965, {{one of the}} {{principal}} documents of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, the dogmatic constitution Dei verbum (Latin for Word of God), emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of Dei verbum in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, the cathedral underwent a series of renovations. The roof—which was previously made of timber—was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral's crossing. In 1988, air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation.|$|E
50|$|Paenitentiam agere ("Penance for sins") was {{the seventh}} {{encyclical}} made by Pope John XXIII, and was issued on 1 July 1962. It calls on Christians to practice penance and considers <b>the</b> upcoming <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|R

40|$|In an {{interesting}} way the author introduces us to the historical background of primate and filioque related to the Synode in Constantinople in 879 / 880 {{and the name of}} the Patriarch of Constantinople, Fotius. The whole issue shows how useless were the traumata and tensions since unity of the Church manifests itself in differences.

5|$|Agagianian was {{elevated}} to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) from 1958 to 1970. A theological liberal, linguist, and {{an authority on}} the Soviet Union, he served {{as one of the}} four moderators at <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and was twice considered a serious papal candidate, during the conclaves of 1958 and 1963.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} both a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1956) and Doctorate of Canon Law (1961) {{from the}} Gregorian, and after doing pastoral and curial {{work in the}} Diocese of Harrisburg, {{he served as a}} peritus, or expert, and secretary to Bishop George Leech at <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–1965). He attended all four sessions. Keeler worked for the Council Digest, a communications service used to bring people in the United States day-to day news of the Council.|$|E
50|$|He was {{appointed}} Archbishop of Kingston in Ontario on February 26, 1944. He attended all four sessions of <b>the</b> 1962-1965 <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. He both retired as archbishop of Kingston {{and was named}} Titular Archbishop of Maraguia by Pope Paul VI on December 14, 1966; he resigned this title on November 23, 1970.|$|R
2500|$|His uncompromising traditionalism {{led to a}} {{rejection}} of the new Conciliar Church" [...] and he became the first to propound the doctrine of sedevacantism, which maintains that, since the death of Pope Pius XII, there has been a sede vacante in Rome because the following so-called popes espoused the heretical teachings of <b>the</b> sham <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|R

5|$|In 1939, {{after two}} centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue. Pope Pius XII issued a decree on December 8, 1939, authorizing Chinese Catholics {{to observe the}} ancestral rites and {{participate}} in Confucius-honoring ceremonies. The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic spirit of the liturgy, was proclaimed by <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65).|$|E
5|$|When this happened, Soegijapranata was in Europe {{to attend}} <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council {{as part of}} the Central Preparatory Commission; he was one of eleven diocesan bishops and archbishops from Asia. He was able to attend the first session, where he voiced {{concerns}} about declining quality of pastoral work and called for the modernisation of the Church. He then returned to Indonesia, but his health, poor since the late 1950s, quickly declined.|$|E
5|$|Agagianian {{sat on the}} Board of Presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (Vatican II), {{which took}} place from 1962 to 1965. He was {{appointed}} by Pope Paul VI {{as one of the}} four moderators who directed the course of the debates, along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
50|$|Nothing Sacred starred Kevin Anderson as a priest. It {{was criticized}} by some who saw its {{portrayal}} of church issues in <b>the</b> post <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council era as favoring {{those with a}} more liberal view of the Council {{at the expense of}} those with a more conservative one. The show and its sponsors were targeted for boycotts by the Catholic League.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 McKeefry {{had been}} {{appointed}} to the Central Preparatory Commission, which supervised the drafting of documents for <b>the</b> forthcoming <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962-65). During the council's first session, in 1962, these very traditional statements were severely criticized. McKeefry had no sympathy for proposals to introduce vernacular languages into the liturgy. He did not attend <b>the</b> council's <b>second</b> session <b>the</b> following year, although he returned to Rome for the 1964 and 1965 sessions, which he found rather tedious.|$|R
50|$|John Paul II is {{considered}} by some authorities to have helped to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe. John Paul II worked to improve the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. He was criticised by progressives for upholding the Church's teachings against artificial contraception and the ordination of women, and by traditionalists for his support of <b>the</b> Church's <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and its reforms.|$|R
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E
50|$|Until <b>the</b> {{introduction}} of <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, <b>the</b> Procession of the Passion of Christ {{was held on}} Maundy Thursday. This was later transferred to Holy Wednesday while the Phippine Independent Church (Aglipay) retain the Maundy Thursday Procession. Among the most famous processions of the Philippine Independent Church areConcepcion, Malabon, Santa Cruz and Paete Laguna.|$|R
50|$|According to Christoph F. Potworowski, for Chenu the {{incarnation}} is {{the means by}} which God acts within and on behalf of creation. Chenu was invited to be a peritus, or expert, at <b>the</b> Roman Catholic <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962-65) where he was influential in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes).|$|R
50|$|These artworks were {{collected}} by monsignor Vincenzo Regina, archpriest from 1944 to 1991; in accordance with <b>the</b> suggestions of <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council about <b>the</b> care and attention for the ecclesiastical artistic patrimony, after the 1968 Belice earthquake the archpriest started collecting various paintings, sculptures and works of different kind, coming from churches that were unfit for use.|$|R
5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of native Catholics expanded greatly {{in the years following}} his consecration, Soegijapranata was soon faced with numerous trials. The Empire of Japan invaded the Indies beginning in early 1942, and during the ensuing occupation numerous churches were seized and clergymen were arrested or killed. Soegijapranata was able to resist several of these seizures, and {{spent the rest of the}} occupation serving the Catholics in his vicariate. After President Sukarno proclaimed the country's independence in August 1945, Semarang was overcome with unrest. Soegijapranata helped broker a ceasefire after a five-day battle between Japanese and Indonesian troops and called for the central government to send someone to deal with the unrest and food shortages in the city. However, these problems continued to grow, and in 1947 Soegijapranata moved his seat to Yogyakarta. For the remainder of the national revolution Soegijapranata worked to promote international recognition of Indonesia's independence. Soon after the Dutch, who had returned in late 1945, recognised the country's independence, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. During the post-revolution years he wrote extensively against communism and expanded the church; he also served as a mediator between several political factions. He was made an archbishop on 3January 1961, when Semarang was elevated to an ecclesiastical province. At the time he was in Europe, participating in the first session of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. Soegijapranata died in 1963, in Steyl, the Netherlands. His body was flown back to Indonesia, where he was made a national hero and interred at Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery in Semarang.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal Wojtyła {{was elected}} {{on the third}} day of the {{conclave}} and adopted his predecessor's name in tribute to him. John PaulII is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe. John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. He upheld the Church's teachings on such matters as artificial contraception and the ordination of women, but also supported <b>the</b> Church's <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and its reforms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{audience}} {{was a major}} impetus for Pope John’s directing Cardinal Augustin Bea, {{the president of the}} Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, to draft “a declaration on the Catholic Church's relationship to the Jewish people for <b>the</b> upcoming <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.” This action by the Pope led to the promulgation of Nostra aetate (In Our Time) on October 28, 1965. “With Nostra Aetate the Catholic Church took leave from an almost 2,000 year old anti-Jewish tradition, a profound break with the age-old teaching of contempt.” ...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and {{assigned}} {{to participate in the}} drafting and preparation of documents for <b>the</b> upcoming <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65) announced by Pope John XXIII, and was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings. He would later take the lead in opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Council. Refusing to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by its members, he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council {{the dress}} was more elaborate, and had dozens of {{varieties}} and colours. After <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, it was reduced, however exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.|$|E

25|$|Although Pope Benedict XVI {{wore his}} Fisherman's Ring daily, {{it is no}} longer the custom for popes to wear it at all. Generally, a new pope will either inherit the daily-wear ring of his predecessor, keep an old ring of his own preference, or will choose a new daily-wear style. Pope John Paul I usually wore a wide gold band similar in design to <b>the</b> mitre-shaped <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council ring; in {{imitation}} of this, Pope John Paul II wore a wide gold crucifix shaped into a ring that had belonged to Pope Paul VI.|$|R

5000|$|However, in {{contrast}} to the picture presented by the Russian religious poet Aleksey Khomyakov more than a century earlier, <b>the</b> Catholic Church's <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council reasserted <b>the</b> importance of collegiality, clarifying that [...] "primatial authority is inseparable from collegiality and synodality" [...] and that [...] "the Bishop of Rome is a brother among brothers who are sacramentally all equal in the episcopate.|$|R
