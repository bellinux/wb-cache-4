25|$|A {{hand axe}} (or handaxe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces {{that is the}} longest-used tool in human history. It is usually made from flint or chert. It is {{characteristic}} of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods. Its <b>technical</b> <b>name</b> (biface) {{comes from the fact}} that the archetypical model is generally bifacial Lithic flake and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.|$|E

25|$|The maguey plant, {{also called}} a “century plant” in English, {{is native to}} Mexico. It grows best in the cold, dry climates of the rocky central {{highlands}} {{to the north and}} east of Mexico City, especially in the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala. Maguey has been cultivated at least since 200 CE in Tula, Tulancingo and Teotihuacan, and wild plants have been exploited for far longer. The plant historically has had a number of uses. Fibers can be extracted from the thick leaves to make rope or fabric, its thorns can be used as needles or punches and the membrane covering the leaves can be used as paper or for cooking. The name maguey was given by the Spanish, who picked it up from the Taíno. This is still its common name in Spanish, with Agave being its scientific generic or <b>technical</b> <b>name.</b> The Nahuatl name of the plant is metl.|$|E
25|$|Spirit-Eater (Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday) — a {{creature}} made by sorceries and a seed item {{belonging to the}} person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them. It requires a year of House Time to grow from Nothing. It can grow mentally conducive mold on people and can only be destroyed if its seed item is plunged into Nothing. The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops on a sunny day. At all other times, it resembles its model.

500|$|The {{mushroom}} {{takes its}} common {{name from the}} Phrygian cap, {{also known as the}} [...] "liberty cap", which it resembles; P.semilanceata shares its common name with P.pelliculosa, a species from which it is more or less indistinguishable in appearance. The Latin word for Phrygian cap is pileus, nowadays the <b>technical</b> <b>name</b> for what is commonly known as the [...] "cap" [...] of a fungal fruit body. In the 18th century Phrygian caps were placed on Liberty poles, which resemble the stipe of the mushroom. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek psilos (ψιλός) ("smooth" [...] or [...] "bare") and the Byzantine Greek kubê (κύβη) ("head"). The specific epithet comes from the Latin semi ("half" [...] or [...] "somewhat") and lanceata, from lanceolatus, meaning [...] "spear-shaped".|$|E

At last, on the fourteenth day, in a deep alluvial hollow near a squalid group of small Barolong huts, he saw a tiny round stone, much rubbed and water-worn, which he picked up and examined with no little curiosity. The two days he had spent at Dutoitspan had not been wasted. He had learnt to recognise the look of the native gem. Once glance told him at once what his pebble was.

60|$|She was {{probably}} not {{the daughter of a}} hundred earls, but there must have been some such far-descended fair among the ladies who showed themselves {{from time to time in}} the royal paddock across a little space from our Grand Stand. The enclosure has no doubt a more <b>technical</b> <b>name,</b> which I would call it by if I knew it, for I do not wish to be irreverent; but paddock is very sporty, and it must serve my occasion. The King never showed himself there at all, though much craned round for and eagerly expected. But ladies and gentlemen moved about in the close, and stood and talked together; very tall people, very easily straight and well set up, very handsome, and very amiable-looking; they may have been really kind and good, or they may have looked so to please the King and keep his spirits up. I did not then, but I do now, realize that these were courtiers, such as one has always read of, and were of very historical quality in their attendance on the monarch. I trust it will not take from the dignity of the fact if I note that several of the courtiers wore derby hats, and one was in a sack coat and a topper. I am not sure what the fairer reader will think if I tell that one of the ladies had on a dress with a white body and crimson skirt and sleeves, and a vast black picture-hat, and wore it with a charming air of authority.|$|E
