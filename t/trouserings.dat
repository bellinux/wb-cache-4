60|$|I don't know if {{you were}} at Cannes this summer. If you were, you will recall that anybody with any pretensions to being the life {{and soul of the}} party was {{accustomed}} to attend binges at the Casino in the ordinary evening-wear <b>trouserings</b> topped to the north by a white mess-jacket with brass buttons. And ever since I had stepped aboard the Blue Train at Cannes station, I had been wondering on and off how mine would go with Jeeves.|$|E
6000|$|He {{adopted an}} urban style of {{dressing}} {{with the onset}} of Tono-Bungay and rarely abandoned it. He preferred silk hats with ample rich brims, often a trifle large for him by modern ideas, and he wore them at various angles to his axis; his taste in <b>trouserings</b> was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat; he liked his frock-coat long and full, although that seemed to shorten him. He displayed a number of valuable rings, and I remember one upon his left little finger with a large red stone bearing Gnostic symbols. [...] "Clever chaps, those Gnostics, George," [...] he told me. [...] "Means a lot. Lucky!" [...] He never had any but a black mohair watch-chair. In the country he affected grey and a large grey cloth top-hat, except when motoring; then he would have a brown deer-stalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of boot-end to the trousers. Of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold studs. He hated diamonds. [...] "Flashy," [...] he said they were. [...] "Might as well wear--an income tax-receipt. All very well for Park Lane. Unsold stock. Not my style. Sober financier, George." ...|$|E
6000|$|A large, oak-panelled room, {{its three}} high windows, {{each with a}} low, {{cushioned}} seat beneath it, giving on to Gough Square. Thirty-five years before, Peter Hope, then a young dandy with side whiskers close-cropped and terminating just below the ear; with wavy, brown hair, giving to his fresh-complexioned face an appearance almost girlish; in cut-away blue coat, flowered waistcoat, black silk cravat secured by two gold pins chained together, and tightly strapped grey <b>trouserings,</b> had, aided and abetted by a fragile little lady in crinoline and much-flounced skirt, and bodice somewhat low, with corkscrew curls each movement of her head set ringing, planned and furnished it {{in accordance with the}} sober canons then in vogue, spending thereupon more than they should, as is to be expected from the young to whom the future promises all things. The fine Brussels carpet! A little too bright, had thought the shaking curls. [...] "The colours will tone down, miss--ma'am." [...] The shopman knew. Only by the help of the round island underneath the massive Empire table, by excursions into untrodden corners, could Peter recollect the rainbow floor his feet had pressed when he was twenty-one. The noble bookcase, surmounted by Minerva's bust. Really it was too expensive. But the nodding curls had been so obstinate. Peter's silly books and papers must be put away in order; the curls did not intend to permit any excuse for untidiness. So, too, the handsome, brass-bound desk; it must be worthy of the beautiful thoughts Peter would pen upon it. The great sideboard, supported by two such angry-looking mahogany lions; it must be strong to support the weight of silver clever Peter would one day purchase to place upon it. The few oil paintings in their heavy frames. A solidly furnished, sober apartment; about it that subtle atmosphere of dignity one finds but in old rooms long undisturbed, where one seems to read upon the walls: [...] "I, Joy and Sorrow, twain in one, have dwelt here." [...] One item only there was that seemed out of place among its grave surroundings--a guitar, hanging from the wall, ornamented with a ridiculous blue bow, somewhat faded.|$|E
5000|$|Persian {{embroidery}} {{is one of}} the Persian arts. It uses mostly floral motifs, especially Persian figures, animals, {{and patterns}} related to hunting. Persian embroidered women's <b>trouserings,</b> also known as [...] "Gilets Persans", have rich patterns; these were in fashion until the late 18th century. The designs are always of diagonal, parallel bands filled with floral ornamentation.|$|E
