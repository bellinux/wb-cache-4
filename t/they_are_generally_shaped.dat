25|$|For theft prevention, lock {{shackles}} {{and chains}} are often case-hardened to resist cutting, whilst remaining less brittle inside to resist impact. As case-hardened components {{are difficult to}} machine, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> before hardening.|$|E
5000|$|The Scottish tattie scone, {{also known}} as a [...] "potato scone", is similar to the Irish potato farl, but rather than being square, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> either as small rounds, or one large round divided into four quadrants, in a similar fashion to {{traditional}} Scottish oatcakes.|$|E
50|$|It {{generally}} has 3-4 leaves, when fully grown these reach {{a height of}} between 4-18 cm long and between 1-2.8 cm wide {{at the base of}} the plant, but averagely, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> 1-1.5 cm wide. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> lanceolate <b>shaped,</b> channelled, glossy green above with a greyish-green below, with a white cartilaginous margin.The large leaves normally obscure the flower stem.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> small fish that have skin with a velvet texture. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> {{flattened}} in <b>shape,</b> with small pelvic fins, and a fleshy pad under the head, which, {{in at least}} one species, forms a sucker for attaching the fish to the sea floor. Some also have venomous spines. They live on the sea bottom close to the shore, at depths of up to 100 m.|$|R
50|$|Sculptural gongs (also {{known as}} Gong Sculptures) are gongs which serve the dual purpose {{of being a}} musical {{instrument}} and a work of visual art. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> not disc <b>shaped,</b> but instead take more complex, even abstract forms. Sculptural gongs were pioneered in the early 1990s by Welsh percussionist and metal crafter, Steve Hubback, who was partially inspired {{by the work of}} the French Sound Sculptors, Francois and Bernard Baschet.|$|R

The inflorescence is a panicle-like cluster of white flowers up to about 7 centimeters long. The fruit is a rough, lobed capsule about half a centimeter long containing three seeds.|$|R
50|$|Shared ranches are the {{top tier}} of {{investment}} grade property categories accounting for 3% of the market. An example could be bordered by state and/or national forest and parks. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> rectangular in <b>shape</b> and has a good-sized stream that flows through it, then through the neighboring ranch, emptying into a river with a very good trout fishing reputation. They have great mountain views, and there are numerous meadows and irrigated creek bottom areas. The {{more of the following}} attributes a shared ranch has generally adds to the price.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} an {{aromatic}} annual plant growing up to 80 centimeters tall. It is coated in stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are 2 to 12 centimeters long, the largest occurring {{around the base}} of the stem and those higher on the stem much smaller. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> oblong in <b>shape</b> with wavy or lobed edges. The inflorescence is a coiled cyme of several flowers. The flower has a bell-shaped purple or blue corolla up to a centimeter long. The corolla has a white tube and sometimes a white throat. The stamens and style are well exserted from mouth of the flower. The fruit is a somewhat rounded capsule a few millimeters wide.|$|R
2500|$|Gulls {{range in}} size from the little gull, at [...] and , to the great black-backed gull, at [...] and [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> uniform in <b>shape,</b> with heavy bodies, long wings, and {{moderately}} long necks. The tails of all but three species are rounded; the exceptions being Sabine's gull and swallow-tailed gulls, which have forked tails, and Ross's gull, which has a wedge-shaped tail. Gulls have moderately long legs, especially when compared to the similar terns, with fully webbed feet. The bill <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> heavy and slightly hooked, with the larger species having stouter bills than the smaller species. The bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger white-headed species and red, dark red or black in the smaller species.|$|R

50|$|In {{cases where}} the blades are removable, the {{container}} should have an o-ring or gasket between {{the body of the}} container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around.|$|R
50|$|The virions <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> enveloped {{though the}} {{intracellular}} mature virion {{form of the}} virus, which contains a different envelope, <b>is</b> also infectious. <b>They</b> vary in their shape depending upon the species but <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> like a brick or as an oval form similar to a rounded brick because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wrapped by the endoplasmic reticulum. The virion is exceptionally large, around 250-380kb in length and the diameter is around 350 nm. It carries its genome in a single, linear, double-stranded segment of DNA.|$|R
2500|$|The imagines {{of these}} beetles <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> oval in <b>shape,</b> {{with a very}} convex upperside, and <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> [...] long. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> {{yellowish}} to light brown in color, frequently with light and dark patterns dotted with 10 or more rows of punctures on the elytra. The family's most distinctive characteristic is the large coxal plates of the hindlegs, which are immobile (though not fused in the centerline) and extend back along the underside to cover most of the abdomen base and the hindleg trochanters and femora. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> used as air storage supplementing the air carried under the elytra.|$|R
50|$|A {{fire screen}} sheet {{began as a}} form of {{furniture}} that acted as a shield between the occupants of a room and the fireplace, and its primary function was to reduce the discomfort of excessive heat from a log fire. Early firescreens <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> as flat panels standing on attached feet, or as adjustable shield-shaped panels mounted on tripod table legs.|$|R
50|$|The virions <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> enveloped {{though the}} {{intracellular}} mature virion {{form of the}} virus, which contains a different envelope, <b>is</b> also infectious. <b>They</b> vary in their shape depending upon the species but <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> like a brick or as an oval form similar to a rounded brick because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wrapped by the endoplasmic reticulum. The virion is exceptionally large, its size is around 200 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length and carries its genome in a single, linear, double-stranded segment of DNA. Genomes are linear, around 130-375kb in length.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> not toxic but {{considered}} non-edible due {{to their}} fibrous texture in the mature stage that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> found at.|$|R
5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> by the miasma theory, and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|R
50|$|While lyrical {{segments}} and leisurely gaiety can be {{commonly found}} in Radić’s compositions, other works, as early as his diploma work feature pungent harmonies and polytonality. His remarkable themes <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> by scherzo-like and burlesque rhythms, as his works often communicate grotesque and parody. Despite {{the fact that he}} challenged tonal clichés by unusual treatment of parallel chords and obstinate figures, Radić did not abandon the tonal line of thought.|$|R
5000|$|Poxviridae viral {{particles}} (virions) <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> enveloped (external enveloped virion- EEV), {{though the}} intracellular mature virion (IMV) {{form of the}} virus, which contains different envelope, <b>is</b> also infectious. <b>They</b> vary in their shape depending upon the species but <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>shaped</b> like a brick or as an oval form similar to a rounded brick because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> wrapped by the endoplasmic reticulum. The virion is exceptionally large, its size is around 200 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length and carries its genome in a single, linear, double-stranded segment of DNA.
