2500|$|While Smith {{still held}} to typical white South African {{views of the}} time, the seeds for his later change of {{position}} were planted in the 1960s and '70s. [...] Smith credited Swiss theologian Karl Barth for helping him eventually decide to fight apartheid. [...] In 1963, Barth {{asked him if he}} was really free to preach the Gospel in South Africa. [...] Barth asked him the question three times, concluding with [...] "Will you be free to preach the Gospel even if the government in your country <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you are preaching against the whole system?" [...] Smith found that [...] "I could not really answer the question truthfully. I thought I was free, and yet I was not sure."

[...] Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites. [...] "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." [...] A comment in the Boston Herald, typified the reaction among much of the US press: [...] "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail." [...] The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President F.

2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.

2500|$|Around 1905, {{before he}} joined the Poporanists, Mihail Sadoveanu was the prime target of Sanielevici's anti-Sămănătorism. The Marxist critic was {{especially}} reductive {{when it came to}} Sadoveanu's [...] "baroque" [...] brand of literary naturalism: [...] "not naturalism, but pure bestiality. Mr. Sadoveanu has the soul of a Wachtmeister. When a Wachtmeister <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he 'has lived', it means that he has been to many drunken parties and has had many women". The first (amiable) split between Ibrăileanu and Sanielevici was about their different interpretations of Sadoveanu's stories. Outside commentators were perplexed by the obscure rationale of their debate. According to a 1906 column by writer Marin Simionescu-Râmniceanu: [...] "That which Mr. Sanielevici finds to be poisonous for our society in Sadoveanu's work, Mr. Ibrăileanu will judge to be the absolute opposite. [...] Whatever Curentul Nou has said over one page, regarding Sadoveanu's work, is denied on the other. Wouldn't it then have been better not to have said it at all?" [...] Writing in 2003, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu suggested that the reason was entirely subjective: [...] "It is practically impossible to comprehend for instance why H. Sanielevici found Sadoveanu's prose to be so violent in subject and primitive in style, while [...] Ibrăileanu and others readily viewed it as profoundly balanced and artistic in manner." [...] Jicu is inclined to believe that Sadoveanu was more the [...] "collateral victim" [...] of Sanielevici's attack on Iorga, and that Sanielevici was at his worst in assessing the quality of Sadovenian writings.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} {{enlightenment}} {{period in the}} 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the [...] "moral sense" [...] or [...] "moral sentiment" [...] referred to by Hume and Adam Smith, the latter writing in plural of the [...] "moral sentiments" [...] with the key one being sympathy, which {{was not so much}} a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. Jeremy Bentham gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in common, in the room of it. He then <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other’s moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense {{is not the same as}} the author’s, being struck out of the account as not worth taking. This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term [...] "common sense" [...] is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself. In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French sens commun and German Gemeinsinn are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while bon sens (good sense) and gesunder Verstand (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday [...] "common sense".|$|E
