"I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>now,</b> first off, I'm Christian, and {{my career}} is {{evidence}} of God in my life, and I think {{that most people are}} already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and I think they'll be very shocked to find out how huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons. And it's really going to shock the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The Grand Prince Ferdinando was grievously {{ill with}} syphilis; {{he had become}} prematurely senile, not {{recognising}} anybody who came to see him. Cosimo despaired. He successfully requisitioned the assistance of Pope Clement XI with Anna Maria Franziska. He sent the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her. She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>now,</b> in case you are not informed, {{that we have no}} money in Florence..." [...] He added that [...] "two or three quarters of my pension are fallen into arrears." ...|$|E
2500|$|An often {{overlooked}} literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes {{to more than}} any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used [...] Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding On the Road, he {{wrote in a letter to}} Ginsberg, [...] "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> as I look back on the flood of language. It is like Ulysses and should be treated with the same gravity." [...] Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel Visions of Cody, which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.|$|E

2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>now</b> you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is another}} reason for my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> of this {{decision}} of mine to remain a clergyman," [...] he continued. [...] "It is because I value your respect and friendship, and I hope you will believe that I would not take this course unless I saw my way clear {{to do it with}} sincerity." ...|$|R
5000|$|I think I {{was reading}} the Bible around that time. That's where I think phrases such as [...] "workman's wages" [...] came from, and [...] "seeking out the poorer quarters".
