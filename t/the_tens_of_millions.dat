25|$|A large {{majority}} of the funding for elite sport in the United Kingdom is commercially generated, but this is concentrated heavily on a few sports.

Other major sports have a turnover in low nine figures or <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions.</b> For example, cricket is highly dependent on its TV contract, which was worth £55 million a year for the 2006-09 seasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{worst of}} the {{flooding}} stayed in the Susquehanna River area. Both the West Branch and North Branch, {{as well as most}} of their tributaries, flooded. Flood damage was sustained in a swath from southern New York to the mouth, located at Havre de Grace in northern Maryland. Record flooding occurred in the Binghamton, New York region, and in northeastern and central Pennsylvania. In Wilkes-Barre, the water was measured at 42.66 feet, an astounding number compared to the record of 40.90 feet Hurricane Agnes set in 1972. Municipalities along the river sustained major damage, many households and businesses among them declared condemned.

25|$|Some {{meteorological}} conditions, especially {{rapid changes}} in barometric pressure, as {{seen with the}} passing of a front, can displace bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths comparable to seismic tsunami, but usually with lower energies. These are essentially dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunami, the only differences being that meteotsunami lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunami, and that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunami can't be modelled as having been caused instantaneously. In spite of their lower energies, on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life. They have been documented in many places, including the Great Lakes, the Aegean Sea, the English Channel, and the Balearic Islands, where they are common enough to have a local name, rissaga. In Sicily they are called marubbio and in Nagasaki Bay they are called abiki. Some examples of destructive meteotsunami include 31 March 1979 at Nagasaki and 15 June 2006 at Menorca, the latter causing damage in <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> of euros.|$|E

50|$|The Pennsylvania House of Representatives ordered school {{district}} consolidation study, which {{was performed by}} The Education Management Group, LLC. It was provoked by a 14.30% decline of the 2000-01 pupil population in the County's six public {{school district}}s by 2011. Multiple state projections found a continual decline over <b>the</b> next <b>ten</b> years due to a declining birth rate. Fayette County has two Career and Technology Centers that appear to overlap. If the Connellsville Career and Technical Center were eliminated, the savings in salaries and benefits alone would be significantly greater than $2 million, not counting the savings in utilities from closure of the facility. Savings was projected to be in <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>million</b> each year, largely due to shedding duplicate administration positions.

[...] The second lowest mintage for the series came with the 1931 nickel struck at the San Francisco Mint. The 1931-S was minted in a quantity of 194,000 early in the year. There was no need for more to be struck, but Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly asked the San Francisco Mint to strike more so that the pieces would not be hoarded. [...] Using materials on hand, including the melting down of worn-out nickels, San Francisco found enough metal to strike 1,000,000more pieces. Large quantities were saved in the hope they would become valuable, and the coin is not particularly rare today despite the low mintage.|$|E
