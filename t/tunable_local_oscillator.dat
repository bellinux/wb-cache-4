Many new communications systems would greatly benefit from these components. For example, planned low Earth orbiting satellite networks have a need for electronically scanned antennas. Thin ferroelectric films {{are one of the}} major technologies competing to fill these applications. When a direct-current (dc) voltage is applied to ferroelectric film, the dielectric constant of the film can be decreased by nearly an order of magnitude, changing the high-frequency wavelength in the microwave device. Recent advances in film growth have demonstrated high-quality ferroelectric thin films. This technology may allow microwave devices that have very low power and are compact, lightweight, simple, robust, planar, voltage tunable, and affordable. The NASA Lewis Research Center has been designing, fabricating, and testing proof-of-concept tunable microwave devices.

40|$|In {{wide-band}} microwave receivers {{of a type}} now undergoing development, {{the incoming}} microwave signals are electronically preamplified, then frequency-up-converted to optical signals that are processed photonically before being detected. This approach differs from the traditional approach, in which incoming microwave signals are processed by purely electronic means. As used here, wide-band microwave receivers refers especially to receivers capable of reception at any frequency throughout the range from about 90 to about 300 GHz. The advantage expected {{to be gained by}} following the up-conversion-and-photonic-processing approach is the ability to overcome the limitations of currently available detectors and <b>tunable</b> <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the frequency range of interest. In a receiver following this approach (see figure), a preamplified incoming microwave signal is up-converted by the method described in the preceeding article. The frequency up-converter exploits the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic response of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator made of LiNbO 3. Up-conversion takes place by three-wave mixing in the resonator. The WGM resonator is designed and fabricated to function simultaneously as an electro-optical modulator and to exhibit resonance at the microwave and optical operating frequencies plus phase matching among the microwave and optical signals circulating in the resonator. The up-conversion is an efficient process, and the efficiency is enhanced by the combination of microwave and optical resonances. The up-converted signal is processed photonically by use of a tunable optical filter or <b>local</b> <b>oscillator,</b> and is then detected. Tunable optical filters can be made to be frequency agile and to exhibit high resonance quality factors (high Q values), thereby making it possible to utilize a variety of signal-processing modalities. Therefore, it is anticipated that when fully developed, receivers of this type will be compact and will be capable of both wide-band and narrowband signal processing. Thus, one compact receiver of this type would afford the functionality that, heretofore, could have been obtained only by use of multiple heterodyne microwave receivers...|$|R

The NbTiN HEB mixer is made from a 12 nm thick NbTiN thin film deposited on a quartz substrate at room temperature. A gold electrode is formed in situ on the NbTiN thin film without breaking vacuum to ensure good contact. The uncorrected DSB receiver noise temperature is measured to be 1700 K at 1. 5 THz, whereas the mixer noise temperature is derived to be 1000 K after corrections for losses of the input optics and the intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier chain. The required LO power absorbed in the HEB mixer is evaluated to be 340 nW by using an isothermal technique. The IF gain bandwidth {{is supposed to be}} about 1. 3 GHz or higher.

In order to investigate the cooling mechanism of our HEB mixers, we have conducted performance measurements for a few HEB mixers with different microbridge sizes both at 1. 5 and 0. 8 THz.

40|$|Though {{heterodyne}} detection provides a valuable technique for detecting small signals, the conventional system has several inherent disadvantages. In {{applications such as}} communications and radar, obtaining a reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requires (1) a good knowledge of the velocity of the transmitter or target, (2) a stable yet <b>tunable</b> <b>local</b> <b>oscillator,</b> and (3) a target or source that presents a minimum of frequency broadening. These conditions are frequently not adhered to by real systems, particularly in the ir and optical, giving rise to detection capabilities far below optimum. Calculations are presented for the use and operation of a three-frequency nonlinear heterodyne system that eliminates many of the stringent conditions required for conventional {{heterodyne detection}}, while maintaining its near-ideal SNR. The technique, which is similar in principle to heterodyne radiometry, makes use of a two-frequency transmitter and a nonlinear second detector and is particularly useful for signal acquisition; for signals of unknown Doppler shift, in fact, performance is generally superior {{to that of the}} conventional system. Although primary emphasis is on the ir and optical because of the large Doppler shifts encountered there, application of the principle in the microwave and radiowave is also discussed. For cw radar and analog communications, the SNR, power spectral density (PSD), and minimum detectable power (MDP) are obtained and compared with the standard configuration. Both sinewave and Gaussian input signals are treated. A variety of specific cases are discussed including the optimum performance case, the typical radar case, and the AM and FM communications case.

The chip is 100 % functional, either running in triggered or trigger-less mode. All building-blocks (DAC, ADC, Band Gap, SER, sLVS-TX/RX) and very front ends are working as expected. Analog performance shows a remarkably low ENC of 90 e-, a fast-rise time below 25 ns and low-power consumption (about 4 μA/pixel) in both synchronous and asynchronous front-ends; a very linear behavior of CSA and discriminator. No significant cross talk from digital electronics has been measured, achieving a low threshold of 250 e-.

(For example, the surface resistance for a YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) thin film at 10 GHz and 77 K is more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of copper at the same frequency and temperature.) SrTiO 3 and Ba(x) Sr(1 -x) TiO 3 films are used because their crystal structure and lattice parameters are similar to those of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta), thus enabling the growth of highly textured YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) films with high critical current densities on the underlying ferroelectric film, or alternatively, of highly textured ferroelectric film on the underlying YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) film. Our efforts have been concentrated so far in determining the deposition parameters required for optimal ferroelectric thin-film growth (i. e., maximum tunability and lowest loss) and in investigating different varactor configurations to determine which geometry is the most advantageous in terms of tunability, losses, and required bias for a given communication application. For example, we have observed that for optimized SrTiO 3 films in a parallel plate capacitor, tunabilities of up to 47 percent and dissipation losses (tan d) of 0. 05 are attainable at 1 MHz, 80 K, and within the 0 - to 5 -V bias range. In contrast, for an interdigital configuration, tunabilities of up to 70 percent and tan d ranging from 0. 015 to 0. 001 (depending on bias) have been observed at 1 MHz and 77 K within the 0 - to 100 -V bias range.

40|$|Photonic <b>local</b> <b>oscillators</b> and {{modulators}} {{that include}} whispering-gallery mode (WGM) optical resonators {{have been proposed}} as power-efficient devices for generating and detecting radiation at frequencies {{of the order of}} a terahertz. These devices are intended especially to satisfy anticipated needs for receivers capable of detecting lowpower, narrow-band terahertz signals to be used for sensing substances of interest in scientific and military applications. At present, available terahertz-signal detectors are power-inefficient and do not afford the spectral and amplitude resolution needed for detecting such signals. The proposed devices would not be designed according to the conventional approach of direct detection of terahertz radiation. Instead, terahertz radiation would first be up-converted into the optical domain, wherein signals could be processed efficiently by photonic means and detected by optical photodetectors, which are more efficient than are photodetectors used in conventional direct detection of terahertz radiation. The photonic devices used to effect the up-conversion would include a <b>tunable</b> optical <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> and a novel electro-optical modulator.

40|$|The {{transition}} towards sub-mmWave frequencies offer tremendous potential {{due to the}} abundantly available RF bandwidth, reduced form-factor of the passives like on-chip antennas, {{and better}} lateral and range resolution (as a consequence of high bandwidth). At frequencies below 100 GHz, the limited bandwidth puts an upper limit on the maximum data-rate for communication systems, and it also limits the range resolution for FMCW RADAR systems. Hence, operation towards sub-mmWave frequencies provides an alternative in mitigating {{the limitations of the}} existing wireless systems at low frequencies. It also opens the possibility for new applications like high-resolution imaging for security and non-destructive testing, and material identification and characterization. The traditional optical techniques for signal generation and detection at sub-mmWave frequencies are bulky and expensive. The low integration density of III-V based electronic systems limits its scalability, especially for mass volume applications. The recent advancements in silicon process technologies have made it a viable low-cost alternative as compared to III-V based compound semiconductors. A significant advantage of silicon technologies is the high integration density. This allows the implementation of the digital and baseband electronics in the same chip resulting in a compact, and single-chip solution. This gives silicon-based systems a significant edge over the III-V semiconductors in terms of economies of scale. This thesis addresses the various circuit design challenges and system level considerations for the realization of a fully-integrated Tx and Rx chipset towards sub-mmWave frequencies in SiGe BiCMOS technologies. The first part of the thesis is focused on the challenges at the individual circuit building blocks of the RF front-end. The challenges associated with the implementation of wideband amplifiers with high gain and output power at frequencies close to fmax/ 2 are addressed here. The limited output power of power amplifiers (PAs) limits the maximum range of wireless links, {{and is one of the}} significant impediments. In this thesis, the special considerations for loadline matching of PAs towards sub-mmWave frequencies are presented, and power combination techniques for PAs are explored for high power generation. Another key challenge addressed here is the implementation of a high-power wideband <b>tunable</b> <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LO) source operating at the fundamental frequency with low dc-power consumption. This is one of the key aspects in giving the chipset a generic attribute, which makes it suited for applications requiring a fixed (communication) or a wideband tunable LO (FMCW RADAR, imaging, material characterization). In terms of output power, bandwidth and figure-of-merit (FoM) at the individual building-block level, the results presented in this thesis are beyond the current state-of-the-art in silicon technologies and are comparable to implementations in III-V technologies. Based on the circuit building-blocks presented in the first part, a generic wideband fully integrated direct-conversion 240 GHz quadrature Tx and Rx chipset is implemented and presented in the second part of the thesis. The focus here is on the integration of wideband on-chip antennas designed to be used with an external replaceable silicon lens for high directivity. The chip-lens assembly is mounted on a low-cost PCB material (Rogers 4350 B) for an overall compact form-factor. The on-chip antenna and chip-lens assembly is done in a collaborative teamwork and leverages the expertise of our research group in low-cost packaging. For wideband IF matching, stepped impedance microstrip-line based low-pass filters are implemented on the PCB. The packaged chipset was used to demonstrate a high data-rate communication system at 240 GHz over a wireless link of 70 cm. For QPSK and BPSK modulation schemes, the maximum measured data-rates using this chipset are 24 Gbps and 25 Gbps respectively. At the time of writing this thesis, this is the highest data-rate reported in the literature for fully integrated wireless systems above 200 GHz in silicon technologies. A different version of this chipset is used for the demonstration of a monostatic FMCW RADAR system operating in the 210 - 270 GHz frequency range, and it uses identical circuit building blocks. This proves the generic attribute of this implementation. Hence, the results from this work provide a holistic foundation towards mitigating the challenges at the circuit and system level for the realization of compact, low-cost and fully integrated silicon-based systems for emerging applications towards sub-mmWave frequencies. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{includes a}} method for transmitting and detecting high speed Ultra Wideband pulses across a wireless interface. The transmitter includes a serializer and pulse generator. The receiver comprises a fixed delay line, multiplier, local serializer (with a sequence matching the transmitter), digital delay lines, low noise amplifier and logic fan-out buffer along {{with an array of}} D flip-flop pairs. Each flip-flop pair is enabled, at fixed time increments, to detect signals at a precise time; the timing is controlled by the pseudo-random sequence generated by the local serializer. A <b>local</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>oscillator</b> is controlled by detecting the phase change of the incoming signal and applying compensation to maintain the phase alignment and clock synchronization of the receiver to the clock reference of the transmitter. The invention uses a pair of pulses with a fixed delay and then relies on mixing the two to provide better noise immunity...|$|R
25|$|The {{frequency}} of the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF±fLO. If the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> frequency {{is less than the}} desired reception frequency, it is called low-side injection (fIF = fRF − fLO); if the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is higher, then it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO − fRF).|$|R

50|$|Now let us {{consider}} the homodyne tomography detector as depicted in figure 4. The signal photon (this is the quantum state we want to reconstruct) interferes with the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator,</b> when they are directed onto a 50-50% beamsplitter. Since the two beams originate from the same so called master laser, {{they have the same}} fixed phase relation. The <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> must be intense, compared to the signal so it provides a precise phase reference. The <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is so intense, that we can treat it classically (a = α) and neglect the quantum fluctuations. The signal field is spatially and temporally controlled by the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator,</b> which has a controlled shape. Where the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> is zero, the signal is rejected. Therefore, we have temporal-spatial mode selectivity of the signal. The beamsplitter redirects the two beams to two photodetectors. The photodetectors generate an electric current proportional to the photon number. The two detector currents are subtracted and the resulting current is proportional to the electric field operator in the signal mode, depended on relative optical phase of signal and <b>local</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|R
40|$|Anti-parallel diode pair mixers {{offer the}} benefit of {{intermodulation}} nulling without conversion nulls. However, the practicality of intermodulation nulling in improving mixer distortion performance is dictated by the trade-off between conversion loss and <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> drive power requirements. In systems where noise figure is not critical and availability of <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> drive power is at a premium, intermodulation nulling can be most useful. A correlation between third-degree non-linearity and intermodulation null with respect to <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> drive is found. This correlation allows the designer to optimize the intermodulation distortion for a given <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> power by changing the mixer source and load impedances. 4 page(s...|$|R

Under the ETS 300 744 standard, the chosen modulation method, COFDM, {{is assumed to be}} multipath resilient. Previous work has shown that this is not necessarily the case. It has been shown that the <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> required for demodulation from intermediate-frequency to baseband must be very accurate. This paper shows that under multipath conditions, standard methods for obtaining <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> phase lock may not be adequate.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} {{the effects of}} radio-frequency <b>Local</b> <b>Oscillator</b> non-idealities on OFDM inter-carrier interference. The synthesizer has the main role on modulation and demodulation process of base band IQ signals to radio frequency channels which need to fulfill several requirements imposed by standards specifications. Phase and frequency stability are crucial, since the synchronization of the entire system depends on the accuracy of this circuit. The discussed OFDM system {{is based on a}} simulation scenario including radio-frequency channel conversion considering <b>Local</b> <b>Oscillator</b> with configurable phase noise power and bandwidth. This feature allows the study of global system based on <b>Local</b> <b>Oscillator</b> output spectrum. Sub-channel spacing, cyclic redundancy and pulse shaping are configurable. The obtained results indicate that free run oscillator phase noise characterization is not appropriate when the <b>Local</b> <b>Oscillator</b> in the radio-frequency front end is based on synthesizer architecture. System evaluation is based on error vector magnitude. The relation of this metric with the <b>Local</b> <b>Oscillator</b> phase noise allows the performance estimation of the global system...|$|R
5000|$|In 1901, Reginald Fessenden {{demonstrated}} a direct-conversion heterodyne receiver or beat receiver {{as a method}} of making continuous wave radiotelegraphy signals audible. Fessenden's receiver did not see much application because of its <b>local</b> <b>oscillator's</b> stability problem. While complex isochronous electromechanical oscillators existed, a stable yet inexpensive <b>local</b> <b>oscillator</b> was not available until Lee de Forest invented the triode vacuum tube oscillator.
