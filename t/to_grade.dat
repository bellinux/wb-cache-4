5|$|Several scales exist <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity}} of the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E

English Heritage conducted a major restoration of the memorial during 2011, completed in time for Remembrance Day.

Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers.

5|$|Hwa Chong International School is a co-educational {{international}} school, {{offering a}} six-year programme from Grade 7 (11–13 years old) <b>to</b> <b>Grade</b> 12, finishing with the International Baccalaureate.

5|$|NY47 {{began at}} an {{interchange}} with NY104 (now the interchange between NY390 and NY104) in Greece one mile (1.6km) {{west of the}} Rochester city limits.

NY47 followed the modern NY390 alignment south to I-490, where NY47 continued onto what is now I-390. The routings of NY47 and current I-390 were identical to NY383 (Scottsville Road) in Chili, where NY47 was forced <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> level via a partially constructed interchange, as modern I-390 had yet to be constructed in the area southeast of NY383.|$|E

50|$|For the 2001-2002 school year, {{when most}} of the renovations were complete, the grades housed in each school {{building}} changed. The elementary schools went from housing <b>grades</b> K-5 <b>to</b> housing <b>grades</b> K-4; the middle school from <b>grades</b> 6-7 <b>to</b> <b>grades</b> 5-6; the junior high school from <b>grades</b> 8-9 <b>to</b> <b>grades</b> 7-8; and the high school from <b>grades</b> 10-12 <b>to</b> <b>grades</b> 9-12. Because of this change, from 2000 until 2005, the first day of classes was different for every grade. Grades K-2, 5, 7, 9, and 10 began classes on one day, while grades 3-4, 6, 8, and 11-12 began classes the following day. Both sets of grades then attended classes on the third day and would continue to follow normal schedules from that point on.|$|R
5|$|Originally, NY5 entered Buffalo {{from the}} south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and {{followed}} South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008, there was momentum to tear it down, but the momentum has passed.|$|E
5|$|The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, {{also known}} as Dinosaur Court, {{are a series of}} sculptures of dinosaurs and other extinct animals in Crystal Palace Park, in the London borough of Bromley. Commissioned in 1852 to {{accompany}} the Crystal Palace after its move from the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and unveiled in 1854, they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world, pre-dating the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by six years. While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards, the models were designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the scientific direction of Sir Richard Owen, representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time. The models were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded <b>to</b> <b>Grade</b> I listed in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Debates {{continued}} {{on the exact}} location of the parkway, in particular whether it would bypass downtown Pasadena. In the late 1920s, Los Angeles acquired properties between San Fernando Road and Pasadena Avenue, and City Engineer Lloyd Aldrich began grading between Avenues 60 and 66 in the early 1930s. By June 1932, residents of Highland Park and Garvanza, who had paid special assessments to finance improvement of the park, became suspicious of {{what appeared to be a}} road, then graded along the Arroyo Seco's west side between Via Marisol (then Hermon Avenue) and Princess Drive. Merchants on North Figueroa Street (then Pasadena Avenue) also objected, due to the loss of business they would suffer from a bypass. Work stopped while the interested parties could work out the details, although, in late 1932 and early 1933, Aldrich was authorized <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> a cheaper route along the east side between Avenue 35 and Hermon Avenue. To the north, Pasadena and South Pasadena endorsed in 1934 what was essentially Hincks's 1916 plan, but lacked the money to build it. A bill was introduced in 1935 to add the route to the state highway system, and after some debate a new Route 205 was created as a swap for the Palmdale-Wrightwood Route 186, as the legislature had just greatly expanded the system in 1933, and the California Highway Commission opposed a further increase.|$|E
5|$|The four-lane iconic skyway {{carries the}} US1/9 {{concurrency}} for most its length. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, US1 and US9 are generally north–south routes. The {{west end of}} the skyway begins as US1/9 roadway ascends and passes over Raymond Boulevard in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood. At Tonnele Circle, US1/9 exits <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge and the skyway becomes the four-lane Route139 as it passes over it. While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a cut in Bergen Hill, just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also passes over the New Jersey Turnpike, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on landfilled wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands.|$|E
