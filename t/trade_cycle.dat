40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of three school choice mechanisms. The Boston mechanism is influential in practice, while the two alternative mechanisms, the Gale-Shapley and Top <b>Trading</b> <b>Cycles</b> mechanisms, have superior theoretical properties in terms of incentives and efficiency. Consistent with theory, this study indicates a high preference manipulation rate under the Boston mechanism. As a result, efficiency under Boston is significantly {{lower than that of}} the two competing mechanisms in the designed environment. However, contrary to theory, Gale-Shapley outperforms the Top <b>Trading</b> <b>Cycles</b> mechanism and generates the highest efficiency. Our results suggest that replacing the Boston mechanism with either Gale-Shapley or Top <b>Trading</b> <b>Cycles</b> mechanism might significantly improve efficiency, however, the efficiency gains {{are likely to be more}} profound when parents are educated about the incentive compatibility of these mechanisms. school choice, Boston mechanism, mechanism design, Gale-Shapley mechanism, Top <b>Trading</b> <b>Cycles</b> mechanism...|$|R

2500|$|Inquiries in the West Riding of Yorkshire by an {{assistant}} to the Royal Commission had led him to note that out-door relief was an important (and relatively cheap) way of coping with the <b>trade</b> <b>cycle.</b> When trade was slack manufacturers could lay off 500 hands at once - this was a scale for which it would be impracticable to provide workhouse accommodation; where unemployment {{was likely to be}} temporary (e.g. caused by the <b>trade</b> <b>cycle</b> or sickness) the eventual cost (and inconvenience) of re-establishing a household on leaving the workhouse had to be borne in mind and could well suggest the wisdom of out-door relief. Furthermore, where the head of a household containing child wage-earners became unemployed, it would be more sensible (and cheaper) to supplement the household income by a judicious amount of out-door relief than to move the family to the poorhouse. [...] Hand-loom weavers, a group of workers now habitually in great distress, had very low earnings; not because their wages were supplemented by out-door relief, but because they were competing with power-looms; nothing would be gained by forcing them into the workhouse or to turn to some occupation for which they would not have the required physical strength. [...] The Assistant Commissioner also noted that diet of West-Riding poorhouse inmates was not a deterrent; {{there seemed to be a}} deliberate policy of 'the best of everything, and plenty of it'.|$|E
2500|$|Hayek's {{principal}} {{investigations in}} economics concerned capital, money, {{and the business}} cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility {{to the value of}} money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for [...] "industrial fluctuations" [...] based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work {{as a starting point for}} his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [...] "Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Cycle.</b> There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that [...] "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process".|$|E
40|$|We study {{markets with}} {{indivisible}} goods where monetary compensations are not possible. Each individual is endowed with an object and a preference relation over all objects. When preferences are strict, Gale's top <b>trading</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm finds the unique core allocation. When preferences {{are not necessarily}} strict, we use an exogenous profile of tie-breakers to resolve any ties in individuals' preferences and apply Gale's top <b>trading</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm for the resulting profile of strict preferences. We provide a foundation of these simple extensions of Gale's top <b>trading</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm from strict preferences to weak preferences. We show that Gale's top <b>trading</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm with fixed tie-breaking is characterized by individual rationality, strategy-proofness, weak efficiency, non-bossiness, and consistency. Our result supports the common practice in applications to break ties in weak preferences using some fixed exogenous criteria and then to use a 'good and simple' rule for the resulting strict preferences.

For each school a strict priority ordering of students {{is determined by the}} school district. Each student has strict preference over the schools. We first define weaker forms of fairness, consistency and resource monotonicity. We show that the top <b>trading</b> <b>cycles</b> mechanism is the unique Pareto efficient and strategy-proof mechanism that satisfies the weaker forms of fairness, consistency and resource monotonicity.

Our first experimental result is that the introduction of minority reserves enhances truth-telling of some minority students under the Gale-Shapley but not under the Top <b>Trading</b> <b>Cycles</b> mechanism. Secondly, for the Gale-Shapley mechanism we also find that the stable matchings that are more beneficial to students are obtained more often relative to the other stable matchings when minority {{reserves are}} introduced.
