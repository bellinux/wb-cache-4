50|$|A <b>tender</b> box is a mailbox {{that is used}} {{to receive}} the {{physical}} <b>tender</b> or bid documents. When a <b>tender</b> or bid is being called, a <b>tender</b> or bid number is usually issued as a reference number for the <b>tender</b> box. The <b>tender</b> box would be open for interested parties to submit their proposals {{for the duration of the}} bid or <b>tender.</b>|$|R

50|$|Invitation to <b>tender</b> is also {{a similar}} process to a <b>tender</b> notification. The major {{difference}} is the institution or organisation who created the <b>tender</b> chooses who to invite, often {{in the form of}} a closed <b>tender.</b> <b>Tender</b> notification services provide a vast array of people and companies about an open <b>tender</b> that anyone can apply for.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tender</b> {{notifications}} (sometimes called <b>tender</b> alerts), {{provide the}} client with given <b>tender</b> {{information that they}} desire. This is often delivered {{in the form of}} an email notification, saving the client visiting multiple websites to check for updates on potential clients. Most repacks provide both private and public sector <b>tender</b> opportunities. The idea is that <b>tender</b> notification systems deliver <b>tender</b> opportunities to the company, dramatically reducing the amount of time spent looking for these <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Type MP1 <b>tenders</b> {{originally}} entered South African Railways (SAR) {{service in}} 1912, as <b>tenders</b> to Class 12 Mountain type locomotives. The locomotive and <b>tender</b> {{were designed by}} D.A.

5|$|At the {{completion}} of his contract following the 2016–17 season, Schroeder as a restricted free agent {{was not to be}} <b>tendered</b> a new contract with the Wild.

50|$|It was a {{tank wagon}} type <b>tender,</b> similar in {{appearance}} to the North American Vanderbilt type <b>tender,</b> with a cylindrical water tank which had an inside diameter of 6 ft. The <b>tender</b> {{was similar to}} the Type MX <b>tender,</b> but its wheelbase was 10 ft shorter. Like the Type MX <b>tender,</b> it rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies, supplied by General Steel Castings of Eddystone, Pennsylvania, and became commonly known as a Torpedo <b>tender.</b> Like its engine, the <b>tender</b> was equipped with vacuum brakes.|$|R
5|$|In early 1989, {{operations}} in Horsham were reduced, following {{the loss of}} the <b>tendered</b> route to Barns Green. A new service to Billingshurst was briefly introduced in February 1989, but withdrawn after two months. In July, a new service between Guildford and the British Aerospace site at Dunsfold Aerodrome was introduced. Further expansion eastwards came in November 1989, when the operation of eleven <b>tendered</b> routes, requiring six buses, was won from the county council. These were operated under the Hobbit name. A new service linking Normandy and Christmaspie to Guildford two days a week was introduced in October 1989. A second route to the two villages was added in 1995. In January 1999 a new route from Farnham to Tongham via Normandy was launched, as was a direct service from the village to Guildford. In 1998 an outstation was opened in Aldershot following the award of contracted work in Reading to Tillingbourne.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tenders</b> {{from various}} {{scrapped}} locomotive types were used. The <b>tender</b> {{depicted in the}} main picture is a three-axle <b>tender</b> while the official SAR locomotive diagram depicts a <b>tender</b> with four axles on two bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} AB <b>tender</b> {{design was}} adapted for the three-cylinder G class locomotive 4-6-2 <b>tender</b> locomotive rebuilds of 1937. These <b>tenders</b> {{had a more}} substantial <b>tender</b> underframe, and was also unique in that the body was of welded construction rather than the traditional riveted style. As such, they {{became known as the}} 'G' style <b>tender.</b> When the six locomotives were withdrawn in 1956, their <b>tenders</b> were fitted to AB class locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group agreed {{on a set of}} {{standards}} for all water <b>tenders</b> that are used for wildland firefighting. The <b>tenders</b> are divided into support <b>tenders</b> and tactical <b>tenders.</b>|$|R

50|$|Five {{locomotive}} {{classes and}} models, built by six manufacturers, were delivered new with Type KT <b>tenders,</b> which were numbered for their engines {{in the number}} ranges as shown. An oval number plate, bearing the engine number and often also the <b>tender</b> type, {{was attached to the}} rear end of the <b>tender.</b> On some <b>tenders,</b> presumably after number plates went astray, the number was weld-written on the <b>tender</b> instead, as on the illustrated <b>tender</b> no. 2041.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tender</b> {{was mounted}} on bogie trucks for smooth riding: a {{refinement}} that the <b>tenders</b> of LMS and LNER streamliners lacked. The PC class <b>tender</b> {{was equipped with}} a <b>tender</b> cab in case the locomotive needed to run tender-first.|$|R

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally <b>tendered</b> in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce <b>tendered</b> his {{resignation}} {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine was}} tended {{by a new}} Type JT1 <b>tender,</b> built with an {{underframe}} and bogies identical {{to those of the}} Type JT <b>tender.</b> As on the Type GT <b>tender</b> of the Class S, the top sides of the Type JT1 <b>tender’s</b> coal bunker were set inwards to afford the crew the maximum rearward field of vision. The front of the engine and the back of the <b>tender</b> were fitted with modified and strengthened draft gear. The intermediate drawgear between engine and <b>tender</b> was similar in design to that of the Class 15F. The engine and <b>tender</b> were both fitted with vacuum brakes.|$|R
