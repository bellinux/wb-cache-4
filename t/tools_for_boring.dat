40|$|Abstract: The {{control method}} for {{machining}} non-cylinder pin hole of piston was studied systematically. A new method was presented by embedding giant magnetostrictive material (GMM) into the tool bar proper position. The model is established {{to characterize the}} relation between control current of coil and deformation of tool rod. A series of tests on deformation of giant magnetostrictive tool bar were done and the results validated the feasibility of the principle. The methods of measuring magne-tostrictive coefficient of rare earth GMM were analyzed. The measuring device with the bias field and prestress was designed. A series of experiments were done to test magnetostrictive coefficient. Experimental results supplied accurate characteristic pa-rameter for designing application device of GMM. The constitution of the developed control system made up of displacement detection and temperature detection for thermal deformation compensation was also introduced. The developed machine <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>boring</b> the non-cylinder pin hole of piston has the micron order accuracy. This control method {{can be applied to}} other areas for machining precision or complex parts...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Games with {{a purpose}} (center) should fit between skilled professions (left) and simplistic micro-work that uses people as human-processing units (right). Games {{with a purpose}} should not seek to ‘gamify’ uninteresting tasks that are already easily crowdsourced, but to {{facilitate}} complex, collaborative, and creative and skilled work. Games with a purpose (gwaps) are expensive and challeng-ing to create, yet are touted as a cure-all for getting people to do uninteresting and repetitive tasks in exchange for fun and entertainment. Not only are poorly-executed gwaps in-effective for their purposes, but they can potentially under-mine future gwaps by burning out players and discouraging potential gwap supporters and investors. The goal {{of this paper is}} to challenge the role of gwaps as <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> disguising <b>boring</b> work as entertainment. We discuss recommendations for future gwap designs that are informed both by commer-cial game design and by parallel developments in paid crowd work...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. In {{order to}} assure {{precision}} {{and quality of}} boring operations, on-line tool condition monitoring is essential. In this research, Counterpropagation Neural Networks (CPN???s) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) are {{used in conjunction with}} features extracted from 3 -axis cutting force data for the on-line measurement and detection of <b>tool</b> wear <b>for</b> precision <b>boring.</b> Force data was collected for carbide inserts during the boring of titanium parts. At the end of each boring operation, the average flank wear width was measured to determine the cutting tool conditions. Measurements were accomplished {{with the aid of a}} toolmaker???s microscope. Fourteen features were extracted from the cutting force data. In order to determine which features showed the best indication of cutting tool conditions, a Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm was utilized to reduce the number of features for on-line measurements and detection of precision boring of titanium parts. The selected two most prominent features were kurtosis of longitudinal force and average of the ratio between tangential force and radial force. On-line classification showed excellent results, using both a 2 x 30 x 1 CPN and a 2 x 2 ANFIS, of being able to predict tool conditions on-line with 100...|$|R
