5|$|Despite <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> competition, natural ice {{remained}} {{vital to}} North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to continue to expand. Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along the Hudson River and Maine alone, the Hudson having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River in Maine to meet the demand, and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 saw another ice famine hit the east: the Hudson harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations in Maine, where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> threat, Brock {{moved quickly to}} bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E

25|$|Using the {{viewpoints}} of <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> {{science and}} reading {{extensively in the}} ethology literature, Bowlby developed new explanatory hypotheses for what {{is now known as}} human attachment behaviour. In particular, on the basis of ethological evidence he was able to reject the dominant Cupboard Love theory of attachment prevailing in psychoanalysis and learning theory of the 1940s and 1950s. He also introduced the concepts of environmentally stable or labile human behaviour allowing for the revolutionary combination of the idea of a species-specific genetic bias to become attached and the concept of individual differences in attachment security as environmentally labile strategies for adaptation to a specific childrearing niche. Alternatively, Bowlby's thinking about the nature and function of the caregiver-child relationship influenced ethological research, and inspired students of animal behaviour such as Tinbergen, Hinde, and Harry Harlow.|$|E

25|$|Yet the {{formation}} of a new field, genetic engineering, would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference, where Joshua Lederberg was the most outspoken supporter for <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human insulin, Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the outward}} {{appearance}} of success, {{the party was}} suffering from internal divisions. Other countries under French colonial rule, including Morocco, Indochina and several in West Africa, had either become independent or had begun to negotiate the process to independence; this inspired the hope that Madagascar could follow suit, allowing the tantalizing opportunity for PADESM to wield unfettered power in Malagasy politics. [...] <b>This</b> <b>emerging</b> possibility fragmented the party, which became paralyzed by in-fighting. [...] The progressive faction split off to form the Parti sociale démocrate (PSD, Social Democratic Party) in Mahajanga in December 1956, {{under the leadership of}} Philibert Tsiranana, a French-educated school teacher of Tsimihety coastal origin, and Andre Raseta.|$|E
500|$|Between the 16th and 17th centuries, three {{families}} controlled the sanjaks that constituted {{the region of}} Palestine: the Ridwans presided over Gaza, while the Farrukhs and Turabays presided over Nablus and Lajjun, respectively. Because of common interests and prior military slave relationships, the {{three families}} forged close ties {{throughout the course of}} their rule. The Ridwans were the dominant faction in <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> unified dynasty. Evidence of intermarriage between the families is indicated by Ottoman registers. For example, the granddaughter of Ahmad ibn Turabay, the founder of the Turabay dynasty, was the mother of Governor Assaf Farrukh Pasha. Assaf's wife was Shaqra Khatun, a daughter of Governor Husayn Pasha. After the deaths of Assaf Pasha and Shaqra, two of their sons, Muhammad Bey and Ali Bey, entered the custody of Husayn's brother, Governor Musa Pasha. A daughter of Hasan [...] "Arap" [...] Pasha, sister to Musa and Husayn, was married to Assaf's brother Ali Farrukh. Sharing common property also helped sustain the families' unity.|$|E

500|$|As {{educational}} opportunities were made {{available in the}} 19th-century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, and some founded their own art associations. Artwork made by women {{was considered to be}} inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became, according to art historian Laura Prieto, [...] "increasingly vocal and confident" [...] in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern, and freer [...] "New Woman", a movement which O'Neill was heavily involved in. According to Prieto, artists [...] "played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> type through their own lives". [...] In the late 19th century and early 20th century, about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world from a woman's perspective. Other successful illustrators were Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Violet Oakley.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, General Motors was {{concerned}} about how the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would test the Volt to determine its official fuel economy rating. The controversy centered on whether, by including a gasoline engine, the Volt should be classified as a hybrid rather than an electric car as claimed by General Motors. If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around [...] due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> class of hybrid-electrics. General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method {{to take into account}} the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel [...] on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight.|$|E

500|$|Great Britain {{controlled}} the whole island by 1815, and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as {{advisor to the}} Governor. The council was composed of three Europeans and one representative each of the Sinhalese, the Sri Lankan Tamils, and the Burghers. But this situation changed in 1919 {{with the arrival of}} British Governor William Manning, who actively encouraged the idea of [...] "communal representation". He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils, a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor. Because of this, the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and {{to think of themselves as}} a minority community. They focused on communal representation in the council rather than national representation, and decided that their delegates should be leaders from their own community. [...] This new sense of community identity changed the direction of Tamil nationalism. Starting in the mid-1920s, [...] their developing national awareness transformed into a more active national consciousness, with a heightened determination to protect the interests of the Ceylon Tamil community. Influenced heavily by political history and, perhaps more importantly, Colombo-centered developments of the British administration, <b>this</b> <b>emerging</b> Tamil national consciousness led to the establishment of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress headed by Tamil politician, G.
