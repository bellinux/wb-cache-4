5000|$|In a pusher configuration, {{the force}} {{provided}} by the propeller is pushing towards the engine, rather than away. To convert a tractor engine and propeller combination to pusher operation it {{is not sufficient to}} simply turn the engine and propeller round, since the propeller would continue to [...] "pull" [...] driving the aircraft to the rear. Assuming the engine cannot be run in the reverse direction, the [...] "handedness" [...] of the propeller must be reversed. The loads on the <b>thrust</b> <b>race</b> (bearings that prevent fore and aft movement of the crankshaft) are also reversed, because the pusher propeller is pushing into the engine rather than pulling away from it as in a tractor. Some modern engines designed for light aircraft are fitted with a <b>thrust</b> <b>race</b> suitable for both [...] "pushing" [...] and [...] "pulling", but others require a different part depending in which sense they are operating. Power-plant cooling design is more complex than for the tractor configuration, where the propeller forces air through the system.|$|E
50|$|On {{either side}} of the gear are the thrust washers. The thrust washers are pushed against the ball {{bearings}} inside the gear by Belleville washers. On one side of the gear is an adjusting collar, which allows for adjustments in the amount of slip allowed by the differential. A thrust bearing (or <b>thrust</b> <b>race),</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the gear, is used to stop the differential from loosening the retaining screw holding the output cups, used to attach the differential to the axle, onto the differential.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of filming, Richter had a 300-page book called The Essential Buckaroo that {{consisted}} of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years. Principal photography began during {{the second week of}} September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A. Buckaroo's neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the San Bernardino Mountains. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane and <b>Thrust</b> <b>Racing</b> owners Jerry Segal and George Haddebeck. Segal started with a Ford F-350 truck, reinforced the frame assembly, added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a DC-3, and a one-man cockpit modeled after a Messerschmitt fighter plane. Under the hood, Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. The Oscillation Overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added. The design was the basis for the Flux Capacitor in the 1985 film Back to the Future. The prop itself would ultimately be reused a number of times on various Star Trek episodes.|$|R

50|$|Self-built {{hovercraft}} {{are ideal}} for hobbyists and for people for whom price is the main criterion. They can be self-designed craft, built from a plan or they can be kit-built craft. A kit can cost as little as $600 for a one-person craft, up to $5000 or more for a larger craft. Depending on the manufacturer a kit may be complete or almost complete. Most kits include engines. Alternatively a hovercraft can be built from scratch. Many plans can be found online so all you need do is buy your materials.Generally, racing hovercraft are provided with a high-RPM motor fan at the backside of the hovercraft for the required <b>thrust.</b> The <b>racing</b> hovercraft's height is limited to provide it stability even at high speeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{bearings}} in the {{air motors}} of modern jet aircraft engines must operate dry in hostile conditions at temperatures up to 500 ° C, where the <b>thrust</b> <b>races</b> in the actuators operate at temperatures up to 300 ° C. One of the few metallurgical combinations which can function efficiently under these conditions is martensitic stainless steel on tungsten carbide. The work described was initiated to isolate the wear mechanisms of two such steels in contact with tungsten carbide at temperatures up to 500 ° C. Experiments were carried out on angular contact bearings similar to these used in service, where both rolling and sliding is present and also for pure sliding conditions using a pin-on-disc apparatus. Wear measurements of the bearings were obtained with wear rates, friction and surface temperatures from the pin-on-disc machine {{for a series of}} loads and speeds. Extensive X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out on the wear debris, with also S. E. M. analysis and hardness tests on the worn surfaces along with profilometry measurements of the disc. The oxidational parameters of the steel were obtained from measurements of oxide growth rates by ellipsometry. Three distinct mechanisms of wear were established and the latter two were found to be present in both configurations. These involve an oxidational-abrasive mechanism at loads below 40 N with pin surface temperatures up to about 300 °C, with the mechanism changing to severe wear for higher loads. As the temperature increases a third wear mechanism appears due to transfer of relatively soft oxide films to the steel surface reducing the wear rate. Theoretical K factors were derived and compared with experimental values which were found to be in good agreement for the severe wear mechanism. The pin-on-disc experiments may be useful as a screening test for material selection, without the considerable cost of producing the angular contact bearings...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{research}} questions employed in this study, the Nigerian immigrant community first began with student sojourners and is currently more effective within the African-American context. This community would perhaps have been much slower in evolving but for the crisis of institutional instability back in the Nigerian homeland {{as well as the}} policies of two American presidents. The major features of the Nigerian immigrant community with varying degrees of influences in America are: the Nigerian offspring, the Nigerian church, the Nigerian community media, the Nigeria women association, the Nigerian attorneys and physicians. ^ The Nigerian offspring represent a conciliatory generation to Black America, the Nigerian homeland, Euro-America, and the most favorable orbit of incorporating Nigerian indices into the American mosaic. Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta exhibit one of the strongest evidences of the Southern typology of Nigerian immigrants in the U. S. Within this same setting, the generational and socio-cultural experiences of Nigerians and African-Americans are closely related. Both in their American agenda as well as aspirations toward the homelands, Nigerians are replaying the generational schemes of Black America. Analyses of the relationships between the generations of forced migration and voluntary migration in the Nigerian-U. S. based community media conform to a greater degree of understanding than misunderstanding. ^ The benefits derived from the two historic migrations of black Africans to the U. S. are lopsided. Predisposed to neither assimilation nor integration, the Nigerian diaspora in particular exhibit a carefully selective pattern of socioeconomic identification which corresponds with segregated incorporation into society. Generally, the incorporation of the African diaspora in America favors a north to-east to-south <b>thrust</b> of the <b>races</b> of Africa. Africans from West and Central Africa, where a majority of the forced migrants were taken, are more likely to occupy an unfavorable orbit of American incorporation. ^ Due mostly to American slavery, the Nigerian-African variable represents the most distinctive phase of reactive-global migration into the U. S. after decolonization. The predicted problem of 2 ̆ 2 color line in the twentieth century 2 ̆ 2 also corresponded with the reactive patterns of cross-cultural migrations particularly of the races of color and mostly at the intersection of the fifth wave of global migration. Sustained exchanges between Nigeria and the U. S. after colonialism therefore began with the fifth wave of reactive global migration. This marks an important new phase in the development and integration of Nigerian-African indices into the modern world. ...|$|R
