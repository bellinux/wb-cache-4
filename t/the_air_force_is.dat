The Osprey would act as a complement to Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk and planned HH-60W rescue helicopters, being employed in scenarios where its ability to cover more ground quickly would be better suited to search and rescue than more nimble but slower helicopters.|$|E

25|$|Combat Controller training, {{which is}} {{nearly two years}} long, {{is among the most}} {{rigorous}} in the US military. The CCT pipeline has a wash out rate upwards of 90–95%, mostly due to self-eliminations, injuries sustained during training, and academic failures. <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> working to lower the washout rate through proper education, testing and rigorous pre-pipeline training.|$|E

25|$|The Air Element is the {{air force}} branch of the PNGDF, {{operating}} {{a small number of}} light aircraft and rotary wing assets in support of army operations. Like the PNGDF in general {{the air force}} suffers from chronic equipment shortages and underfunding, but probably even more so than the other two branches. The role of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> <b>is</b> to support army operations with transport, air re-supply and medical evacuation capabilities.

500|$|Another {{program that}} <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> {{considering}} is the [...] "Avionics Modernization Program" [...] (AMP). AMP would equip the E-3s with glass cockpits. The Air Force also wants modified E-3s with jet engines {{that are more}} reliable than the original ones, and also with at least 19% higher fuel efficiencies. New turbofan engines would give these E-3s longer ranges, longer time-on-station, and a shorter critical runway length. If the modification is carried out, the E-3s could take off with full fuel loads using runways only [...] long, and also at higher ambient temperatures and lower barometric pressures, such as from bases in mountainous areas. Now that the E-8 Joint STARS are being fitted with the new Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 turbofans, which are stated as having one-half {{the cost of the}} competing engine, the CFM56, <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> again studying the possibility of replacing the E-3's original turbofan engines with more-efficient ones.|$|E
