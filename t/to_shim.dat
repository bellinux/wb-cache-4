40|$|ABSTRACT: Linewidths {{and line}} shapes are key {{criteria}} determining {{the utility of}} a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, and considerable effort is usually devoted <b>to</b> <b>shimming</b> the magnetic field (B) 0 to ensure optimum resolution. However, even if the external field is almost perfectly homogeneous, the sample itself can induce gradients owing to susceptibility effects from its overall shape or internal heterogeneity. Thus, magnetic field gradients nearly always contribute significantly to the linewidths and shapes in an NMR spectrum. Reference deconvolution is a technique which uses {{the shape of a}} single resonance line to measure the actual frequency distribution produced by the local B 0 inhomogeneity and then deconvolves that distribution from the whole spectrum. It is a simple linear process which requires no prior knowledge of the number of lines, their intensities, or their relaxation characteristics. No fitting procedures are used. This article reviews the reference deconvolution method, demonstrates its application to one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and discusses the tradeoffs between resolution and signal / noise...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic field {{inhomogeneity}} {{results in}} image artifacts including signal loss, image blurring and distortions, leading to decreased diagnostic accuracy. Conventional multi-coil (MC) shimming method employs both RF coils and shimming coils, whose mutual interference induces a tradeoff between RF signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and shimming performance. To address this issue, RF coils were integrated with direct-current (DC) shim coils <b>to</b> <b>shim</b> field inhomogeneity while concurrently emitting and receiving RF signal without being {{blocked by the}} shim coils. The currents applied to the new coils, termed iPRES (integrated parallel reception, excitation and shimming), were optimized in the numerical simulation to improve the shimming performance. The objectives of this work is to offer a guideline for designing the optimal iPRES coil arrays <b>to</b> <b>shim</b> the abdomen. In this thesis work, the main field () inhomogeneity was evaluated by {{root mean square error}} (RMSE). To investigate the shimming abilities of iPRES coil arrays, a set of the human abdomen MRI data was collected for the numerical simulations. Thereafter, different simplified iPRES(N) coil arrays were numerically modeled, including a 1 -channel iPRES coil and 8 -channel iPRES coil arrays. For 8 -channel iPRES coil arrays, each RF coil was split into smaller DC loops in the x, y and z direction to provide extra shimming freedom. Additionally, the number of DC loops in a RF coil was increased from 1 to 5 to find the optimal divisions in z direction. Furthermore, switches were numerically implemented into iPRES coils {{to reduce the number of}} power supplies while still providing similar shimming performance with equivalent iPRES coil arrays. The optimizations demonstrate that the shimming ability of an iPRES coil array increases with number of DC loops per RF coil. Furthermore, the z direction divisions tend to be more effective in reducing field inhomogeneity than the x and y divisions. Moreover, the shimming performance of an iPRES coil array gradually reach to a saturation level when the number of DC loops per RF coil is large enough. Finally, when switches were numerically implemented in the iPRES(4) coil array, the number of power supplies can be reduced from 32 to 8 while keeping the shimming performance similar to iPRES(3) and better than iPRES(1). This thesis work offers a guidance for the designs of iPRES coil arrays. Thesi...|$|E
