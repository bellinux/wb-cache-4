5|$|Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an {{independent}} protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The {{objective of the}} group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.

5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> the Oxford University Law Society, {{although his}} principal objective was <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> the Oxford Union, an office frequently {{used as a}} stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E

He became the leader of the UCR after Balbín's death, and was the Radical candidate for the presidency in the 1983 elections, which he won.|$|E

5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office {{was not on}} the cursus honorum, and therefore did not mark the beginning of a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, while under <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E

The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E
