40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} global {{synchronization}} can be achieved using a triangular waveform with advantages at many levels.

As a first step, we develop a reliable mathematical model of a spectrum analyzer, which allows us to compute the power spectrum as measured by this instrument for any signal put at its input. This is particularly important when considering spread spectrum clocking methods for electromagnetic interference reduction, since international regulations impose constraints on the peak of the spectrum of interfering signals as measured by this instrument. Thanks to the developed mathematical tool, we are able to theoretically prove that the maximum peak reduction of the measured spectrum is achieved for a well-defined frequency of the triangular driving signal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a closed-loop self-tuning technique for digitally controlled dc–dc {{switched-mode power supplies}} (SMPS) based on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators, which derives from the more general model reference autotuning techniques. After briefly discussing an open loop, model-reference based tuning technique, a closed-loop solution is presented in which a perturbation frequency generated digitally is injected into the control loop and superimposed to the duty cycle command. The tuning is performed elaborating the signals right before and right after the injection point, and adjusting the PID parameters until predefined bandwidth and phase margin targets are obtained. Theproposed approach allowsfor a robustandrepeatable tuning, {{mainly because of the}} high resolution and dynamics available at the signal injection point. Moreover, the tuning is performed maintaining the closed-loop configuration, thus ensuring voltage regulation even during the PID adjustment, this being a fundamental constraint for most electronic equipments. The proposed technique is simple from the signal processing point of view, since it requires a few integrations, multiplications and phase-shift; further simplified implementations by employing nonsinusoidal perturbation waveforms like square-wave or <b>triangular</b> <b>signals</b> are also proposed.
