25|$|For {{semiconductor}} devices {{used in a}} variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> from the die to the ambient air. <b>Thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a Thermoelectric Module (TEM) {{is not only}} influenced by the material properties, {{but also by the}} heat losses due to the internal and contact <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances.</b> In the literature, the material properties are mostly discussed, mainly to increase the well-known thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. Nevertheless, when a TEM is considered, the separate characterization of the materials of the p and n elements is not enough to have a suitable TEM electrical model and evaluate more precisely its efficiency. Only a few recent papers deal with <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances</b> and their influence on the TEM efficiency; mostly, the minimization of these resistances is recommended, without giving a way to determine their values. The aim of the present paper is to identify the internal and contact <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances</b> of a TEM by electrical characterization. Depending on the applications, the TEM can be used either under constant temperature gradient or constant heat flow conditions. The proposed identification approach is based on the theoretical electrical modeling of the TEM, in both conditions.

This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030–0.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS.

An optimum model for the compositional design of the composite ceramic tool materials is built based on the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>resistance.</b> The <b>thermal</b> stress fracture <b>resistance</b> factor R is used to characterize the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>resistance</b> of the ceramic material.

50|$|When <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances</b> {{occur in}} series, they are additive. Thus, when heat flows {{consecutively}} through two components {{each with a}} resistance of 3 °C/W, the total resistance is 3+3=6 °C/W.|$|R
25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity {{of the heat}} sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat sink base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and {{the edges of the}} heat sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the heat sink. This nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
