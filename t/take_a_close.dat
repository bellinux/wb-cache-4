25|$|Leibniz {{was perhaps}} the first major European {{intellectual}} to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read Confucius Sinarum Philosophus on {{the first year of}} its publication, he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the Confucian ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the Chinese characters were an unwitting form of his universal characteristic. He noted with fascination how the I Ching hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.|$|E
500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> look at the world, keep on doing so {{and in the end}} it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E
