40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to suggest how <b>the</b> social studies <b>lesson</b> should be improved. In this paper, there are two {{suggestions}} as follows. The first one is to make a clear distinction between each stage of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> structure of whole <b>lessons,</b> <b>the</b> organization of <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> and <b>the</b> teaching skill to lessons, expected learning outcome and fact of <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> as well as knowledge, skill, and attitude of learners, and then combine each stage of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> structure with Plan-Do-Check-Action in order to integrate them as PDCA cycle. The second is to propose a new methodology for improvement of <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> namely, spiral PDCA cycle. This spiral PDCA cycle consists of decision of lesson type by learning outcome at the first stage, PDCA cycle for <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> according to each quality formation at the second stage, and PDCA cycle with which <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> is improved by examining and then looking down upon the difference between the relativized view on <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> upon which <b>the</b> practitioner depends, and other views on <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> at <b>the</b> third stage...|$|R

40|$|Basis of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> {{specified}} as “Ataturk’s Principles and History of Turkish Revolution” {{dates back}} to <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> named “History of Revolutions” taught in Ankara Law School in 1925. That lesson had undertaken an important duty in terms of understanding and explicating the Turkish Revolution. In 1933, “Ataturk’s Principles and History of Revolution” began to be taught methodically in universities by means of İnkılap Tarihi Enstitüsü (Institute of History of Revolution) founded as subsidiary of İstanbul University. In 1942, with the law no. 4204, responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> was assigned to Türk İnkılap Tarihi Enstitüsü (Institute of History of Turkish Revolution) associated with Faculty of Languages, History and Geography of Ankara University. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> of “History of Revolution” was legalised. In the term starting from 27 May 1960, content of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> was modified and its name was changed to “History of Turkish Revolution and The Regime of Turkish Republic”. Name of <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> was changed to “History of Turkish Upheaval (Türk Devrim Tarihi) ” in 1968, to “History of Turkish Revolution (Türk İnkılap Tarihi) ” in 1980 and finally to “Ataturk’s Principles and History of Turkish Revolution” in 1981...|$|R
5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E

The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
