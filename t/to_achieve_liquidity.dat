50|$|A {{surplus of}} {{liabilities}} over assets creates {{the need to}} find efficient uses for those funds, i.e. a positive mismatch {{that is not a}} wrong signal (generally a rare scenario in a bank as the bank always has a target return on capital <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> and so requires funds to be put to work by acquiring assets) but only means that the bank is sacrificing profits unnecessarily <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a <b>liquidity</b> position that is too liquid. This excess of liquidity can be deployed in money market instruments or risk-free assets such as government T-bills or bank certificate of deposit (CDs) if this liability excess belongs to bank's capital (the ALM desk will not take the risk of putting capital in a credit-risk investment).|$|R
50|$|From 1779 {{an annual}} fair {{would take place}} at the dairy to {{coincide}} with the religious celebration. This fair is most likely to have been brought into existence {{as a result of the}} financial difficulties in which the Holy Spirit Hospital had found itself. The Hospital had already sought permission from Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria to hold a festival on June 29 to celebrate the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. The dairy fell into difficulties during the Napoleonic Wars when the tenants became bankrupt. The City agreed to an auction in order <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> some <b>liquidity.</b> A café owner from Munich, Paul Schröfl, became the new owner. He built a dance pavilion amongst the trees which became popular with the young people of Munich. Around this were built a number of lodges for closed communities, particularly groups of artists from Munich.|$|R

40|$|Notional Defined Contribution {{pension schemes}} are defined {{contribution}} plans which are pay-as-you-go financed. From a design viewpoint, the countries where NDCs {{have been implemented}} cannot guarantee sustainability due to the choice of notional return paid to the contributions and the indexation rate paid to pensions. We study how the scheme should be designed <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>liquidity</b> and solvency with a limited set of assumptions in a continuous overlapping generations model that increases traceability of the results. The adequacy and actuarial fairness are also jointly studied in the numerical example for the population of Belgium. We find that the proposed indexation and notional rate ensure sustainability and actuarial fairness. However, the effect on pension adequacy depends on the generosity of the scheme at retirement...|$|E
40|$|Commodity {{derivatives}} {{trading in}} India notwithstanding its long and tumultuous history, with globalisation and recent measures of liberalisation, has witnessed a massive resurgence turning {{it one of}} the most rapidly growing areas in the financial sector today. This paper endeavours to test the efficacy and performance of commodity derivatives in steering the price risk management. The critical analytics of performance divulges that these markets although are yet <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> minimum critical <b>liquidity,</b> almost all the commodities throw an evidence of co-integration in both spot and future prices, presaging that these markets are marching in the right direction of achieving improved operational efficiency, albeit, at a slower pace. In the case of some commodities, however, the volatility in the future price has been substantially lower than the spot price indicating an inefficient utilisation of information. Several commodities also appear to attract wide speculative trading. Hedging proves to be an effective proposition in respect of some commodities, while others entail moderate or considerably higher risk. As the markets develop, it remains to be seen whether the information content of future prices could be factored in the course of future monetary policy setting...|$|R

The evidence shows that SEO firms experience significant post-issue improvements in liquidity and reductions in liquidity risk.

After adjusting for liquidity risk, SEO firms show normal long-term performance...|$|R
