2500|$|In both cases, the {{distinction}} mainly concerns simultaneous sounds; if successive sounds are considered, their consonance or dissonance {{depends on the}} memorial retention of the first sound while the second sound (or pitch) is heard. For this reason, consonance and dissonance have been considered {{particularly in the case}} of Western polyphonic music, and <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>article</b> is concerned mainly with this case. Most historical definitions of consonance and dissonance since about the 16th century have stressed their pleasant/unpleasant, or agreeable/disagreeable character. This may be justifiable in a psychophysiological context, but much less in a musical context properly speaking: dissonances often play a decisive role in making music pleasant, even in a generally consonant context—which {{is one of the reasons}} why the musical definition of consonance/dissonance cannot match the psychophysiologic definition.
