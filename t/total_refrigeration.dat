40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} analysis {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of replacing the standard ammonia refrigeration device with the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 refrigeration device in the food industry. The main reason for replacement {{is to reduce the}} total amount of ammonia in spaces like deep-freezing chambers, daily chambers, working rooms and technical passageways. An ammonia-contaminated area is hazardous to human health and the safety of food products. Therefore the preferred reduced amount of ammonia is accumulated in the Central Refrigeration Engine Room, where the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 device is installed as well. Furthermore, the analysis discusses and compares two left Carnot¢s refrigeration cycles, one for the standard ammonia device and the other for the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 device. Both cycles are processes with two-stage compression and two-stage throttling. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the selected refrigeration cycle is the most cost-effective process because it provides the best numerical values for the <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> factor with respect to the observed refrigeration cycle. The chief analyzed influential parameters of the cascade device are: <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> load, total reactive power, mean temperature of the heat exchanger, evaporating and condensing temperature of the low-temperature part...|$|E

The stage 2 VLHC synchrotron radiation dictates a high optimal beam screen temperature. LHC dipole cryostat thermal model results provide data to characterize {{the behavior of the}} stage 2 VLHC cooling system. In the cryogenic concept pursued here, the same helium gas cools the cryostat thermal shield and the beam screen in series. This report also focuses on different scenarios {{that could be used to}} extract the heat loads from the thermal shield and the beam screen. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the performance of}} superconductors and the design of high-field superconducting dipoles have opened the possibility to extend dipole field strength to ~ 25 Tesla in the arc dipoles of a future hadron collider. Design issues are presented for a concept of a Tripler upgrade of LHC, in which a second dual ring would be installed over the LHC ring in the same tunnel. Proton beams from LHC would be transferred to the Tripler midway through the LHC cycle and accelerated to ~ 20 TeV/beam for collisions. A number of obvious issues are explored. Synchrotron radiation power would be 80 times greater, but the critical energy would come as soft X-rays rather than hard UV, and so could be absorbed locally on ~ 150 K photon stops following each dipole so that <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> power could perhaps be no more than that for LHC. Synchrotron damping would be dramatically enhanced in the Tripler compared to LHC, with damping times of ~one hour. Alternatives for beam transfer and low-beta insertions will be discussed. Like LHC, the Tripler would access new mass scales primarily through gluon fusion. The Tripler should reach about twice the mass scale attainable with LHC...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{refrigeration}} system sometimes used where the journey {{time is short}} is <b>total</b> loss <b>refrigeration,</b> in which frozen carbon dioxide ice (or sometimes liquid nitrogen) is used for cooling. [...] The cryogenically frozen gas slowly evaporates, and thus cools the container and is vented from it. The container is cooled {{for as long as}} there is frozen gas available in the system. These have been used in railcars for many years, providing up to 17 days temperature regulation. Whilst refrigerated containers are not common for air transport, total loss dry ice systems are usually used. These containers have a chamber which is loaded with solid carbon dioxide and the temperature is regulated by a thermostatically controlled electric fan, and the air freight versions are intended to maintain temperature for up to around 100 hours.|$|R
40|$|Refrigeration is the {{artificial}} production of low temperatures {{ranging from the}} normal ambient-air temperature down to absolute zero. For cooling in the temperature range down to - 200 F, vapor - compression refrigerations may be use reciprocating, rotary, or centrifugal compressor. For some applications within this band, air-cycle refrigeration, steam-jet refrigeration, or absorption refrigeration may be applied. For the production of extremely low temperatures down to absolute zero, irreversible or reversible adiabatic expansion of a gas, vaporization of a liquefied gas, or magnetic cooling may be used. Refrigerated Sea Water uses vapor-compression refrigeration cycle with reciprocating compressor in this application. The thermodynamic properties of refrigerants must be known before the cycle analyses can be made. A study of evaporators and condensers, those portions of the system used for the absorption and rejection of heat, respectively, involves the fields of heat transmission and fluid mechanics, steady state and periodic and transient heat tranfer {{are involved in the}} determination of cooling-load requirements. The calculation of cooling loads are also requires a knowledge of psychrometry. The physical capacity of a compressor or expander will be determined from thermodynamic factors, but the physical design must also involve structural considerations. The result of refrigeration analysis are refrigeration capacity 6, 15 TR, average coefficient of performance 5, 87 and <b>total</b> capacities of <b>refrigeration</b> 20240, 5 Kcal/h.

40|$|Supermarkets {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} energy-intensive building groups in the commercial sector, consuming 2 to 3 million kWh/yr per store (ES- 1). Over half of this energy use is for the refrigeration of food display cases and storage coolers. Display cases are used throughout a supermarket for the merchandising of perishable food products. The cases are maintained at air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 35 F, depending upon the type of product stored. The operating characteristics and energy requirements of the refrigeration system are directly related to the refrigeration load. The sources of the display case refrigeration load consist of: (1) Moist and warm air infiltration through the open front of the case [...] air curtains are employed to inhibit this infiltration, but some ambient air is entrained, which adds a substantial portion to the refrigeration load. (2) Heat conduction through case panels and walls. (3) Thermal radiation from the ambient to the product and display case interior. (4) Internal thermal loads [...] the use of lights, evaporator fans, periodic defrosts, and antisweat heaters adds to the refrigeration load of the display case as well as directly consuming electric energy. The impact of each of these elements on the refrigeration load is very dependent upon case type (Figure ES- 1). For example, air infiltration is the most significant portion of the refrigeration load for open, multi-deck cases, while radiation is the largest part of the load for tub-type cases. The door anti-sweat heaters represent a major share of the refrigeration load for frozen food door reach-in cases. Figure ES- 2 shows the distribution of display cases in a typical supermarket (ES- 2). Open, multi-deck, medium temperature display cases typically comprise about half of the refrigerated fixtures in a store (ES- 3). In addition, medium temperature fixtures and storage coolers account for roughly 70 to 75 percent of the <b>total</b> store <b>refrigeration</b> load with open, multi-deck cases contributing about 3 / 4 of that fraction. Consequently, the focus of this investigation has tilted toward the open, vertical, multi-deck medium temperature case type. Various technologies and control methods are energy efficiency measures (EEMs) that could be applied to display cases and result in the reduction of the refrigeration load and of the energy consumption of the supermarket refrigeration system. An extensive evaluation of the EEMs was conducted in order to select those that met the following criteria: (1) Near-term implementation [...] All EEMs considered could be implemented with existing refrigeration hardware and technology. (2) Potential for energy-efficiency improvements [...] Energy savings and/or refrigeration load reduction must be obtained by the implementation of the EEM. (3) Enhancement of the ability to maintain target product temperature [...] Proper operation of the display case and maintenance of the stored product temperature could not be compromised by the use of the EEM. The energy impact of a number of viable display case EEMs was quantified by performing whole building hourly simulations. A special version of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE- 2. 3) program was used to develop a model of a supermarket. The model was then calibrated using available end-use monitored data to increase confidence in simulation results...|$|R
40|$|CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, {{is working}} towards the {{construction}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a high-energy, high-luminosity particle accelerator and collider [1] of 26. 7 km circumference, due to start producing frontier physics, by bringing into collision intense proton and ion beams with centre-of-mass energies in the TeV-per-constituent range, {{at the beginning of the}} next century. The key technology for achieving this ambitious scientific goal at economically acceptable cost is the use of high-field superconducting magnets using Nb-Ti conductor operating in superfluid helium [2]. To maintain the some 25 km of bending and focusing magnets at their operating temperature of 1. 9 K, the LHC cryogenic system will have to produce an unprecedented <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> capacity of about 20 kW at 1. 8 K, in eight cryogenic plants distributed around the machine circumference [3]. This has requested the undertaking of an industrial development programme, in the form of a collaboration between CERN and CEA, France, for investigating specific machinery, i. e. very-low pressure cryogenic heat exchangers, volumetric and hydrodynamic compressors, as well as practical and efficient thermodynamic cycles. We report on the aims lines of action and present progress of this ongoing programme...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFish {{products}} are frozen to preserve quality and extend shelf-life. However, freezing {{processes in the}} industry are typically very energy demanding and seldom optimized with regard to energy usage. During freezing, the operating conditions for the refrigeration cycle, {{as well as the}} driving temperature difference over the product changes significantly from start to finish. A complete transient model including a refrigeration plant, an air blast freezing tunnel and food products has been built, based on the Modelica programming language. The product model is discretized into uniform layers, described with equations for temperature dependent properties such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity. Normally, fan power represents about 25 – 30 % of the <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> requirement, {{but at the end of}} the freezing process, heat from the fans can represent up to 95 - 99 % of the refrigeration load. The results from this model indicates that a 33 % reduction in total power consumption, with a penalty of 14 % longer freezing time is possible with better operation of the fan. In general, this model can be a useful tool for visualization of energy saving measures. It combines a product model with a refrigeration system, demonstrating the effect of process modification on both single components and overall process performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{refrigerating}} engineering {{is the youngest}} and simultaneously the most dynamically developing branch of the food-processing industry in Poland. It groups 16 companies having at their disposal 58 cold stores, which are distributed throughout the whole country (Fig. 1), In the area under survey this industry is represented by The Refrigerating Engineering Company in Łódź and by The Central Laboratory of the Refrigerating Engineering in Łódź. The Central Laboratory of the Refrigerating Engineering is a research and development centre. Its production of frozen foodstuffs constitutes a secondary-type activity, and it is carried out {{at the level of}} about 250 ton in The Experimental Plant of Frozen Foodstuffs. In the future the plant is to supply 800 ton of food products with the entire output being left in Poland. The Refrigerating Engineering Company in Łódź is the main producer and distributor of frozen foodstuffs in the nearby administrative provinces of Łódź, Piotrków, Sieradz, Płock, and Skierniewice. It has 3 cold stores with a <b>total</b> <b>refrigeration</b> capacity of 212 ton per day. The storage capacity of the company meets the demand of the region for frozen foodstuffs in 70 per cent. The company performs services in the field of storage and refrigeration of foodstuffs and produces between 6 and 7 thousand ton of frozen fruit and vegetables, readymade foodstuffs and ice-creams per year (Table 1). Its output goes in GO per cent to the domestic market, while export includes frozen fruit only (60 to 80 per cent of production). The company can process 25 to 30 per cent of the total quantity of goods while the remaining part is sent to other cold stores in Poland within the framework of co-operation. In turn, the se cold stores send between 3 and 5 thousand ton of their own products to The Refrigerating Engineering Company in Łódź. In this way the company is able to supply between 6 and 7 thousand ton of frozen foodstuffs a year to the above mentioned 5 administrative provinces. About 65 per cent of all frozen foodstuffs are sold in the administrative province of Łódź (Tables 5 and 6).

40|$|MIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{national}} electricity {{utility in}} South Africa, Eskom, is currently {{under pressure to}} supply the increasing demand for electricity on a national level. To address this problem in the short term, Eskom partially funds load management and energy efficiency projects. In the meantime, Eskom is also increasing their generation capacity through the erection of new power stations. To finance these capital projects, sharp tariff increases, higher than inflation, are levied, resulting in higher operating expenditures for the consumers. These increased tariffs are especially affecting industrial institutions. Large industries are therefore willing participants in the partially Eskom funded electricity savings programme that hold benefits for both parties. One of these large industries is the Mining Sector. This sector is an energy intensive group and consumes up to 15 % of Eskom’s <b>total</b> output. The <b>refrigeration</b> and pumping systems used in the sectors {{are two of the}} major electricity consumers. As part of Eskom’s Demand Side Management (DSM) initiative, an electrical energy savings project was implemented in the deep mines’ chilled water systems. The cooling system is optimally controlled to ensure less underground water usage. This ensures that less water is pumped out by the dewatering system, reducing electrical energy usage. A variety of components, such as refrigeration and energy recovery depend on chilled water to function properly. Every relevant component was simulated and the verification of results was done through correlations with process data obtained from the mine. The simulation results showed acceptable error margins that would not influence accuracy. Two sites where a water supply optimisations project was implemented were selected as case studies. In both case studies, thermal results of the refrigeration and cooling system showed a reduction in cooling effectiveness. In case study A, the energy recovery components showed negative results. All of the results were converted to electrical energy costs to enable comparison. Constraints were evident during deep mine water supply optimisation. These were determined and the thermal effects were simulated. This study enabled basic quantifications of environmental impact and also determining project cost savings. The studies showed that positive and negative effects can be brought on in the mining systems with the reduction in chilled water use. In some cases the cooling system components showed a decrease in cooling effectiveness, but exhibited electrical energy savings. This impact was during periods where no personnel were underground in the working area. In conclusion the study also showed that cost savings resulting from the reduced chilled water are substantially higher than negative financial losses seen on the other components. Master...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{energy costs}} {{initiated}} {{an investigation into}} refrigeration heat recovery as one conservation alternative available for reducing water heating costs on farm dairies. A theoretical energy balance was conducted, from which the potential of recovering refrigeration condenser heat was estimated at up to 60 % of the water heating energy requirements. Preliminary tests with heat exchangers lead {{to the use of}} a tube-in-tube, counter flow, heat exchanger with fins on the refrigerant side, and cores on the water side, to improve the heat transfer characteristics. The exchanger, designed to provide 300 litres of 60 °C water from a 2. 25 kw refrigeration system cooling 2000 litres of milk per day, had an area of 0. 84 m 2, and an overall thermal conductance of 100 W. m- 2. °C- 1. This heat exchanger was inserted between the compressor and condenser of the refrigeration plant and tested with two condenser systems (air and water), four condenser pressures (6. 5 bar, 7. 5 bar, 10 bar and 12 bar), two milk inlet temperatures(23 °C and l 8 °C), and two milk final temperatures (4 °C and 7 °C). In addition, tests on receiver pressure and suction superheat were performed to determine overall system performance. Increasing condenser pressure increased cooling times from 2 hours 32 minutes to 3 hours 17 minutes, after the completion of the 1200 litre morning milking (thus failing to comply with the 3 hour cooling regulation at high condenser pressures.) Also, C. O. P. decreased from 3. 05 to 2. 35 for the water cooled condenser system (2. 70 to 2. 00 for the air cooled condenser system due to fan power consumption). Gross heat recovery rose from 4. 2 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 8. l kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for the water cooled system, giving water outlet temperatures of 45 °C to 64 °C as condenser pressure rose. The corresponding ranges for air cooled condensers were 3. 8 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, to 6. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, and 38 °C to 55 °C. Changing milk inlet and final temperatures gave a proportional change in cooling times and total heat recovery, but had no effect on C. O. P. or heat recovery rates. Suction superheating increased total heat recovery by 15 %, and water outlet temperatures by 9 %. Increases in gross heat recovery with increasing condenser pressure were partially offset by additional compressor power, and yielded nett heat recoveries of 4. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 6. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for water cooled, and 3. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 4. 3 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for air cooled, condenser systems. The maximum gross and nett heat recoveries (at 12 bar condenser pressure) were applied to the energy requirements of a monitored 220 cow town supply dairy. This analysis showed that the gross heat recovery was 51 % of the water heating requirements, but the nett heat recovery dropped to 17 % of the <b>total</b> heating and <b>refrigeration</b> demand. Based on current electricity and equipment prices, it is estimated that the payback period for this level of recovery would be 16 - 17 years. Changing the electricity pricing structure, to reflect up to a 1 : 3 differential in favour of water heating power costs, results in the 6. 5 bar condenser pressure giving optimum results, but the nett returns are significantly lower than those reported. The potential for improved savings is greater from larger capacity systems as the capital investment is not proportionally increased with an increase in scale...|$|R
