25|$|In {{addition}} to his mechanical work Murdoch also experimented {{in the field of}} chemistry and made a number of discoveries. One such was the discovery, first recorded in 1784, of iron cement made from sal ammoniac, or ammonium chloride and iron filings, apparently discovered when Murdoch observed that these two components had accidentally mixed in his <b>tool</b> <b>bag</b> and formed a solid mass. This iron cement was used to fix and harden the joints of steam engines, thus creating a hard durable seal.|$|E
2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, she noticed {{a significant amount of}} grease in her <b>tool</b> <b>bag,</b> [...] "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost <b>tool</b> <b>bag</b> was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the <b>tool</b> <b>bag</b> as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm. The United States Space Surveillance Network constantly monitors over 12,500 items in orbit around the Earth.|$|E

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the {{specific}} mission planning for lunar sample collection, the equipment used, and the analysis and findings concerning the samples at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Texas. Anthony Young documents the collection of Apollo samples {{for the first time}} for readers of all backgrounds, and includes interviews with many of those involved in planning and analyzing the samples. NASA contracted with the U. S. Geologic Survey to perform classroom and field training of the Apollo astronauts. NASA’s Geology Group within the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, helped to establish the goals of sample collection, as well as the design of sample collection <b>tools,</b> <b>bags,</b> and storage containers. In this book, detailed descriptions are given on the design of the lunar sampling tools, the Modular Experiment Transporter used on Apollo 14, and the specific areas of the Lunar Rover vehicle used for the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions, which carried the sampling <b>tools,</b> <b>bags,</b> and other related equipment used in sample collection. The Lunar Receiving Laboratory, which was designed and built at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Texas for analysis and storage of the lunar samples returned from the Apollo lunar landing missions is also described in detail. There are also descriptions of astronaut mission training for sample collecting, with the focus on the specific portions of the mission EVAs devoted to this activity...|$|R

30|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{campaign}} was announced and the first conservation <b>tools</b> <b>bag</b> handed out on February 10, 2004. A {{total of more than}} 34  million conservation tools were distributed to around 18  million residents, which is equivalent to 80  % of occupied residences (MOWE 2012). The water conservations <b>tools</b> <b>bag</b> includes water saving showerheads and faucets, 3 -l sized toilet-tank-bank replacement bags, and leak detection pills. This campaign is considered to be the largest water conservation campaign {{of its kind in the}} world in terms of quantity and quality. The average savings have been 30  % of house water consumption, which is estimated to be 524, 000  m 3 /day (MOWE 2012). The expected annual financial saving resulting from the installation of these tools is estimated at about SAR 900 million (MOWE 2012). The second stage that targeted public sector facilities such as government buildings, schools, mosques, parks, and airports was inaugurated on March 15, 2005. Almost 2.1 million conservation tools were distributed and installed (MOWE 2012). The third stage that targeted the private sector facilities such as hotels, furnished flats, and residential compounds was inaugurated on September 21, 2005. More than 2.5 million conservation tools were distributed and installed (MOWE 2012). In the fourth stage, private sector facilities such as hotels, furnished flats, and residential compounds were targeted. A number of sale points were opened for distributing the water saving showerheads at a nominal price to encourage their usage by the public. More than 592, 000 water saving showerheads have been distributed and installed (MOWE 2012).|$|R

50|$|Shoplifting {{tools are}} illegal in many jurisdictions, and can, in any case, serve as {{evidence}} against the perpetrators.

5000|$|The term [...] "grip" [...] is {{from the}} early era of the circus. From there it was used in {{vaudeville}} and then in today's film sound stages and sets.

Another theory {{is that in the}} days of hand-cranked cameras, it was necessary for a few burly men to hang onto the tripod legs to stop excessive movement of the camera. These men became known as the [...] "good grips"—as they were constantly being instructed to [...] "keep a good grip on the tripod".|$|E
50|$|However, {{to their}} dismay, the hotel's {{elevator}} leads the group {{back to the}} tunnels beneath the hospital. There, they meet the actor Sean Rogerson and discover {{that he has been}} trapped inside for over nine years, lobotomized and driven insane. Rogerson explains that the reason the hospital is like this is due to Dr. Arthur Friedkin's satanic experiments and rituals which merged the spirit world and the real. He then shows them a red door in one of the rooms and tells them {{it is the only way}} out, but it is wrapped in chains that require a chain cutter to remove that is lost (the instrument is in a <b>tool</b> <b>bag</b> left behind by Trevor in one of the rooms) and eventually retrieved.|$|E

More than 1000 MT of bird droppings were scraped off the ironwork lattice of the bridge using hand <b>tools,</b> and <b>bagged</b> into 25 kg sacks. Hundreds of thousands of rivets were removed and replaced, all work being done in very exposed conditions high over a firth with fast-running tides.|$|R

The assistant organiser, Victor Breyer, stood at {{the summit of the}} Aubisque with the colleague who had proposed including the Pyrenees, Alphonse Steinès. The tour organiser, Henri Desgrange was confident enough after the Pyrenees to include the Alps in 1911.|$|R
