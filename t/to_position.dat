40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} proximity, anonymity, and information exposure on group polarization in a GSS context. Proximity was studied at two levels: proximate and distributed. Anonymity was examined at two levels: identified and anonymous. Information exposure was also varied at two levels: exposure <b>to</b> <b>positions</b> without arguments and exposure <b>to</b> <b>positions</b> with arguments. The dependent variables were choice shift and preference change. Distributed groups had greater choice shift than proximate groups. When exposed <b>to</b> <b>positions</b> without arguments, distributed meetings resulted in higher preference change than proximate meetings. But when exposed <b>to</b> <b>positions</b> with arguments, proximity interacted with anonymity to alter preference change. These findings indicate that a distributed GSS setting encourages group polarization. However, group polarization can also be raised in a proximate GSS setting if the anonymity capability is used by group members <b>to</b> exchange mutual <b>positions</b> and arguments. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought <b>to</b> <b>position</b> the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E

5|$|According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army was a {{relatively}} small fighting force of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers. To aid this force, Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of army reserves in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 AD, while two other reserve units were created in 110 AD; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer). The main purpose of these reserve units was <b>to</b> <b>position</b> Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower Wei River against Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Tibetan tribes.|$|E

5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered Dresden and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. Dresden {{increased}} speed <b>to</b> <b>position</b> herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. Dresden then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, Dresden {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. Dresden had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.|$|E

The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan.

A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed.
