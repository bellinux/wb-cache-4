40|$|Abstract—How can we find {{data for}} quality prediction? Early {{in the life}} cycle, {{projects}} may lack the data needed to build such predictors. Prior work assumed that relevant training data was found nearest to the local project. But is this the best approach? This paper introduces <b>the</b> <b>Peters</b> filter {{which is based on}} the following conjecture: When local data is scarce, more information exists in other projects. Accordingly, this filter selects training data via the structure of other projects. To assess the performance of <b>the</b> <b>Peters</b> filter, we compare it with two other approaches for quality prediction. Withincompany learning and cross-company learning with the Burak filter (the state-of-the-art relevancy filter). This paper finds that: 1) within-company predictors are weak for small data-sets; 2) <b>the</b> <b>Peters</b> filter+cross-company builds better predictors than both within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company; and 3) <b>the</b> <b>Peters</b> filter builds 64 % more useful predictors than both withincompany and the Burak filter+cross-company approaches. Hence, we recommend <b>the</b> <b>Peters</b> filter for cross-company learning. Index Terms—Cross company; defect prediction; data mining I...|$|R

It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. <b>The</b> <b>Peter</b> Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in <b>the</b> <b>Peter</b> and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1549, Vermigli became {{involved}} in controversy regarding the Eucharist. He published his disputation with Catholics at Oxford University along with a tract on the subject. He later wrote treatises on the Eucharist against Catholics as well as Lutherans. After Vermigli's death, Robert Masson collected the doctrinal passages scattered throughout these commentaries into a systematic theology called the Loci Communes, which became Vermigli's most well-known work. Several of Vermigli's letters and shorter treatises were also published during and after his life. Beginning in 1994, scholars began translating his works into modern English in a series called <b>the</b> <b>Peter</b> Martyr Library.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>Peter</b> Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} <b>the</b> <b>Peter</b> Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck.

At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E
