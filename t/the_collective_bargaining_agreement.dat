5|$|As a {{free agent}} {{during the summer of}} 1997, Joe Sakic signed a three-year, $21million offer sheet with the New York Rangers. Under <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic.

50|$|On March 9, 2009, Bruno's filed {{a motion}} in {{bankruptcy}} court requesting approval to renegotiate its agreement with UFCW Local 1657. Bruno's announced its intent to sell {{some or all of}} its stores, and is seeking to remove the successor-ship clause from its contracts. The successor-ship clause requires any acquirer of the company or any of its stores to agree, as a term of the sale, to honor <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreements</b> which are currently in place. The removal of this clause was hoped to make the company more marketable to potential buyers who said they would not buy the company or any stores if they were required to honor <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreements.</b> <b>The</b> court ruled on April 27 that the successor-ship clause and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreements</b> would remain intact.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to conducting labor negotiations, the NFLPA represents and protects {{the rights of}} the players; the organization's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe. The union also ensures that the terms of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> are adhered to by the league and the teams. It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{also agreed}} to the honor <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> which The JBG Cos. had with UNITE HERE Local 25. About 125 to 135 people, most of them with 20 years of job tenure at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, were {{affected}} by the closure. The labor union said it was in discussion with Stanford Corp. to win the company's guarantee that the workers would be rehired and that the company would honor the workers' collective bargaining agreement when the hotel reopened.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{signed with}} Phoenix {{a year later}} to an {{entry-level}} contract worth an annual $1.2 million over three years, including bonuses. With his NHL contract, he decided to forgo his senior year of college hockey. The decision was spurred by his performance at the 2004 World Championships with Team USA, competing with NHL veterans. Ballard indicated that he would only leave the University of Minnesota if he was offered the maximum allowable contract for a rookie, as designated by <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> of the time, which he received.|$|E

5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Bargaining</b> <b>Agreement</b> (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Waiters {{signed a}} $16.7 million {{four-year}} contract (two years, plus two team options) {{that was based}} on the rookie wage scales determined by <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement.</b> Drummond also signed a multi-year contract. Kaman signed a one-year $8 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. Wallace re-signed with the Nets for 4 years and $40 million. The Memphis Grizzlies did not make Mayo a $7.2 million qualifying offer, thus allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. He subsequently signed with the Mavericks for two years (with a player option in the second year). The New Orleans Hornets matched the Phoenix Suns' 4-year $58 million contract for Gordon.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Sakic only {{played in}} 65 games {{due to a}} lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first Presidents' Trophy and third {{straight}} division title. He had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche {{all the way to}} the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.|$|E

25|$|The NLRB and {{the courts}} provide {{different}} solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions {{do not apply to}} workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{starting}} in 2012 as a cap of A$4.1 million, {{it was later}} was raised to $4.5 million for the 2013 and 2014 seasons to take pressure off the teams' ability to recruit and retain players.

50|$|Under {{the law of}} contracts, a {{side letter}} has the same force as the {{underlying}} contract. However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with <b>the</b> main <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement.</b> <b>The</b> terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters. In the U.S., several courts of appeals have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain conflict resolution procedures, the parties must use <b>the</b> underlying <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement's</b> dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, arbitration) to resolve the dispute.|$|R

25|$|If {{the issues}} raised by an unfair labor {{practice}} charge could also be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration.

The Mets would use this draft pick to get pitcher Michael Fulmer. Feliciano would immediately go {{on the disabled list}} for the Yankees due to his overuse by the Mets during his career. Setbacks in surgery would prevent him from ever throwing a pitch for the Yankees during the entirety of the two-year contract.|$|E

The players' association responded by disbanding and having its players sue the league for antitrust violations.

The 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs began on April 21, 2006, and concluded on June 19, with the Carolina Hurricanes defeating the Edmonton Oilers to win their first Stanley Cup, after which the Oilers would miss the postseason ten consecutive times.|$|E
25|$|However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, {{operator}} of the Metrodome, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002. Because MLB {{was unable to}} revoke the Twins franchise, it was compelled to keep both the Twins and Expos {{as part of the}} regular season schedule. In <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>agreement</b> signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in August 2002, contraction was prohibited {{until the end of the}} contract in 2006.

25|$|The Flames {{began their}} {{off-season}} by solidifying their management and coaching staff. Jay Feaster, {{who had served}} as interim general manager following the departure of Darryl Sutter in December 2010, {{was named to the}} position on a permanent basis on May 16, 2011, and Special Assistant Craig Conroy accepted a four-year contract extension. Feaster's first decision as general manager was to trade 2008 first round draft pick Tim Erixon to the New York Rangers in exchange for prospect Roman Horak and two second-round picks. The deal was made hours before the Flames would have lost the rights to Erixon, as he refused to sign with Calgary despite being offered the maximum salary and bonuses available under <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Bargaining</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
