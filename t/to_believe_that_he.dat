5|$|Amongst other {{witnesses}} to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour {{on the other}} side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Bizet had fathered a {{child with}} the family's housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Adolphe Bizet's child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son's true paternity.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E

On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing {{him to be the}} bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of feeding the evil of the asylum by bringing it more insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the razor.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known}} as the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E

Stephen Bartowski created the original Intersect prototype and first used it on Hartley, which was updated with the personality, knowledge and identity of Volkoff, a manufactured identity. However, the Intersect was so unstable that it plagued Hartley's mind and deleting his personality as Hartley Winterbottom, instead he started <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Alexei Volkoff, an international arms dealer, and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} investigation {{concluded that the}} crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E

5|$|Constantine's {{advisers}} and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius; even his soothsayers recommended against it, {{stating that the}} sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens. Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had some form of supernatural guidance, ignored all these cautions. Early {{in the spring of}} 312AD, Constantine crossed the Cottian Alps with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000. The first town his army encountered was Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to go in a more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E

50|$|It is {{the story}} about the change of fortune of hairdresser Joseph Miller who was born on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent and nicknamed Sheppey. The play is set in the 1930s. Sheppey, a hard worker at the same {{establishment}} for 15 years, wins a subsidiary prize in the Irish Lottery of £8,500 but does not take to his win with the same style that most others would - and to which most, including his boss, his wife or his daughter and her fiancé (a teacher given <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is more educated than most) — expect him to.|$|R
5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|Ian Meckiff (born 6 January 1935) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} Australia in 18 Tests between 1957 and 1963. A left-arm fast bowler, he {{is best known for}} two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960, causing the first Tied Test in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing.|$|E

Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E

The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
