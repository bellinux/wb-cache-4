5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> The court required <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} research for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> had problems understanding it. He addressed this through the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} season with <b>the</b> <b>Pilots</b> in 2002, Sinclair led Division I in goals with 26. She scored two goals during the {{national}} championship game against conference rival Santa Clara, the second {{of which was a}} golden goal that won <b>the</b> <b>Pilots</b> {{the national championship}}. Sinclair earned three different national Player of the Year honours, and was a finalist for the Hermann Trophy. Named West Coast Conference Player of the Year, she earned All-American honours for the second consecutive year. In the wake of her success for the Canadian national teams and American collegiate soccer, she was named by The Globe and Mail as one of the 25 most influential people in Canadian sports the same year.|$|E

500|$|As for the {{mainstream}} media, the reviews for <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> were mixed. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly commented that, {{given that the}} case was about a serial killer, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> did not show the math in an original way. John Leonard of the New York Magazine called the cast [...] "superb" [...] but criticized <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> for being too busy. Melanie McFarland, the Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic, asserts that <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> storyline was an [...] "unfortunate choice" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> storyline was unoriginal. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, stated that <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and <b>the</b> cast were excellent but that the math was uninteresting.|$|R

50|$|In {{commercial}} aviation and a two-person flight crew, <b>the</b> <b>Pilot</b> Flying (PF) is <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> {{in control of}} the flight trajectory of the aircraft. <b>The</b> other <b>pilot</b> is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Pilot</b> Monitoring (PM) or Pilot Not Flying (PNF). Before a flight departs, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> in command must decide who <b>the</b> <b>Pilot</b> Flying and Pilot Monitoring will be {{for the remainder of the}} flight, or for any specific phase of flight (e.g. take-off, approach or landing). Typically, the flight crew swap roles on the return leg.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCombustion {{instability}} of pilot flame {{has been investigated}} in a model pilot bluff body stabilized combustor by running <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame only. <b>The</b> primary objectives are to investigate <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame dynamics and to provide bases {{for the study of}} the interaction mechanisms between <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame and <b>the</b> main flame. Dynamic pressures are measured by dynamic pressure transducers. A high speed camera with CH∗ bandpass filter is used to capture <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame dynamics. <b>The</b> proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to further analyze the high speed images. With the increase of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> fuel mass flow rate, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame changes from stable to unstable state gradually. The combustion instability frequency is 136 Hz when <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame is unstable. Numerical simulation results show that the equivalence ratios in both the shear layer and the recirculation zone increase as <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> fuel mass flow rate increases. The mechanism of the {{instability of}} <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame can be attributed to the coupling between the second order acoustic mode and the unsteady heat release due to symmetric vortex shedding. These results illustrate that <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> fuel mass flow rate has significant influences on the dynamic stability of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame...|$|R

5|$|US {{intelligence}} officers believe {{the most likely}} explanation was that someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re-programmed the aircraft's autopilot before it travelled south across the Indian Ocean. Police searched the homes of <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and seized financial records for all 12 crew members, including bank statements, credit card bills and mortgage documents. On 2 April 2014, Malaysia's Police Inspector-General said that more than 170 interviews had been conducted as part of Malaysia's criminal investigation, including interviews with family members of <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and crew.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking her}} time to recover from her second ACL injury, Rapinoe {{returned}} for the 2008 season {{and was on the}} starting lineup in all 22 games for <b>the</b> <b>Pilots.</b> She helped the team secure a 20–2 record scoring five goals and serving 13 assists. Her 13 assists ranked first for <b>the</b> <b>Pilots</b> {{as well as in the}} West Coast Conference and she was named West Coast Conference Player of the Year. She was also named a Soccer America First-Team All-American and NSCAA Second Team All-American. Although she had one more season of college eligibility remaining due to her NCAA medical hardship waiver, she opted to enter the Women's Professional Soccer Draft instead. Rapinoe's 88-point career, including 30 goals and 28 assists, ranks tenth in the school's history despite her playing only 60 games.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> who {{had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be the probable cause of the accident.|$|E

25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple is placed in <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> So long as <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> gas valve is held open. If <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|R
