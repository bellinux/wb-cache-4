500|$|Facing a {{difficult}} situation with war on two fronts, Simeon sent a peace proposal through admiral Eustathios to buy {{time to deal with}} the Magyar menace, promising to return the Byzantine captives. Leo VI gladly complied, ordered Eustathios and Nikephoros Phokas to retreat and sent the diplomat Leo Choirosphaktes to Bulgaria to negotiate the terms. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Simeon I had aimed. Leo Choirosphaktes was detained in one fortress and was repeatedly refused an audience. Instead, Simeon I exchanged letters with him, protracting the negotiations, showing suspicions over the wording of the Byzantine proposals, constantly seeking clarifications and adding new demands. The main issue was the exchange of the captives— the Byzantine priority was to free the prisoners captured during the Bulgarian campaign of 894. In one of his letters to Choirosphaktes Simeon I demonstrated his diplomatic skills deriding the emperor: ...|$|E

Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot to me if I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Satie had met Stravinsky for {{the first}} time in 1910. In the {{published}} article, Satie argued that measuring the [...] "greatness" [...] of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some [...] "truth", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Jean Cocteau did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, [...]|$|E

When she first won a medal, you could see how she loved to train to win. She'd had a taste of medals and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she wanted to do: she wanted to be a champion." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Charles Tart {{conducted}} an OBE experiment with a subject known as Miss Z for four nights {{in his sleep}} laboratory. The subject was attached to an EEG machine and a five-digit code was placed on a shelf above her bed. She did not claim to see {{the number on the}} first three nights but on fourth gave the number correctly. The psychologist James Alcock criticized the experiment for inadequate controls and questioned why the subject was not visually monitored by a video camera. Martin Gardner has written the experiment was not evidence for an OBE and suggested that whilst Tart was [...] "snoring behind the window, Miss Z simply stood up in bed, without detaching the electrodes, and peeked." [...] Susan Blackmore wrote [...] "If Miss Z had tried to climb up, the brain-wave record would have showed a pattern of interference. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it did show." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E

2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was needed." ...|$|E
