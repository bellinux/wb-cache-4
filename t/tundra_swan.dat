5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, <b>tundra</b> <b>swan,</b> long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, <b>tundra</b> <b>swan,</b> Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, <b>tundra</b> <b>swan,</b> American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tundra</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus columbianus) are broadly {{distributed}} in North America, use {{a wide variety}} of habitats, and exhibit diverse migration strategies. We investigated patterns of hematozoa infection in three populations of <b>tundra</b> <b>swans</b> that breed in Alaska using satellite tracking to infer host movement and molecular techniques to assess the prevalence and genetic diversity of parasites. We evaluated whether migratory patterns and environmental conditions at breeding areas explain the prevalence of blood parasites in migratory birds by contrasting the fit of competing models formulated in an occupancy modeling framework and calculating the detection probability of the top model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We described genetic diversity of blood parasites in each population of swans by calculating the number of unique parasite haplotypes observed. Blood parasite infection was significantly different between populations of Alaska <b>tundra</b> <b>swans,</b> with the highest estimated prevalence occurring among birds occupying breeding areas with lower mean daily wind speeds and higher daily summer temperatures. Models including covariates of wind speed and temperature during summer months at breeding grounds better predicted hematozoa prevalence than those that included annual migration distance or duration. Genetic diversity of blood parasites in populations of <b>tundra</b> <b>swans</b> appeared to be relative to hematozoa prevalence. Our results suggest ecological conditions at breeding grounds may explain differences of hematozoa infection among populations of <b>tundra</b> <b>swans</b> that breed in Alaska...|$|R

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. <b>Tundra</b> <b>swans</b> and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, <b>tundra</b> <b>swans,</b> mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|R
40|$|Large {{migratory birds}} may bring along stores {{in order to}} survive adverse {{conditions}} and produce a clutch upon arrival (‘capital breeders’) or they may acquire all the necessary resources on the breeding grounds (‘income breeders’). Whether birds are capital- or income-breeders may depend on the distance between the last stopover site and the breeding grounds and the length of the summer season. The degree of capital-breeding may therefore differ among flyway populations of the same species. I used migration speed as a proxy for the degree of capital-breeding, and compared the observed migration speeds of satellite-tracked <b>Tundra</b> <b>Swans</b> Cygnus columbianus from all four main flyway populations with those predicted by an allometric model for 6 -kg waterfowl. Average overall spring migration speed of <b>Tundra</b> <b>Swans</b> was 52. 2 km/d, close to that predicted under a capital-breeding strategy (i. e. carrying the stores for the whole clutch and allowing for 8 days of starvation). This migration speed was in accordance with the speed at which the ice retreats in spring. However, the energy stores for clutch formation and survival on the breeding grounds may be primarily put on at the last stopover. <b>Tundra</b> <b>Swans</b> (‘Whistling Swans’) in the Nearctic, and especially in the Western Nearctic, make use of the rapid advancement of spring on their last leg and accelerate their migration speed accordingly, and so probably rely on income-breeding. In the Western Palearctic, <b>Tundra</b> <b>Swans</b> (‘Bewick’s Swans’) are faced with a slow advancement of spring on their last track, and they may fare better by building up stores on the last stopover and bring these to the breeding grounds. This may not be an option for swans in the Eastern Palearctic, as they are confronted with a very long last leg. The variation in migration speeds on the last leg suggests a large variation in the degree of capital-breeding among flyway populations of <b>Tundra</b> <b>Swans.</b> ...|$|R
