25|$|The {{constitutionality}} of anti-miscegenation laws was {{upheld by the}} U.S. Supreme Court in the 1883 case Pace v. Alabama (106 U.S. 583). The Supreme Court ruled that the Alabama anti-miscegenation statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. According to the court, both races were treated equally, because whites and blacks were punished in equal measure for breaking the law against interracial marriage and interracial sex. <b>This</b> <b>judgment</b> was overturned in 1967 in the Loving v. Virginia case, where the Supreme Court declared anti-miscegenation laws {{a violation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment and therefore unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|After the {{formation}} of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security. Basing <b>this</b> <b>judgment</b> on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.|$|E
25|$|Still, {{with all}} these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not {{encourage}} individual fasting. The community in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, {{and it was the}} duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). <b>This</b> <b>judgment</b> was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).|$|E
25|$|Since {{this latter}} {{interpretation}} did {{not correspond to}} the physical reality of the terrain, the administration created a new distinction between the expressions sommet des montagnes ("summit of the mountains") and sommet de la montagne ("summit of the mountain"), which it had hitherto used interchangeably. Thus, a judgment of the Conseil de contentieux administratif, issued 2 August 1853, defined the first as designating the high point as seen from several successive places, while the second referred only to the crest {{as seen in the}} foreground. A judgment of the Saint-Denis tribunal, issued 5 May 1856, then established that le sommet des montagnes was the crest in the background seen from the sea, {{and that there was no}} need to differentiate between use of the singular and the plural in the expression. <b>This</b> <b>judgment</b> was upheld by a ruling of the Cour de Bordeaux on 19 June 1867.|$|E

25|$|On July 2, 1871, a Hyōgo prefectural {{police officer}} brought a woman {{suspected}} of prostitution {{in to the}} station from within the foreign settlement. Once the investigation determined {{that she was a}} servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under consular jurisdiction and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement—not even to patrol it, let alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty of obstruction of justice against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. <b>This</b> <b>judgment</b> clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hyōgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.|$|E
500|$|To Orosius, Constantine was {{the first}} Christian Roman emperor, except for Philip (he was the [...] "primus imperatorum Christianus, excepto Philippo"). He {{probably}} took <b>this</b> <b>judgment</b> from Jerome—he had met the author in Bethlehem in 415, while on assignment from Augustine of Hippo. Although his judgment is thus not independent of Jerome, Shahîd contends that it is nonetheless valuable since Orosius {{did not have a}} bias towards either emperor. It presents Philip in the role Christian history merited: as precursor to Constantine. Because Orosius' Historiae adversum paganos served as the standard manual of universal history during the middle ages, his judgment on this matter was inherited, and generally accepted, by medieval European writers.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Muhammad {{had already decided}} upon <b>this</b> <b>judgment</b> before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his {{allegiance}} to the Muslim community above that to his tribe. One reason cited by some for such punishment is that Muhammad's previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to Arab and Jewish laws of the time, and {{was seen as a}} sign of weakness. [...] Others see the punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by the Qurayza since they betrayed their joint defence pact with Muhammad by giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the Muslims. Maxime Rodinson interprets the massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity, in order to remove a constant source of threat to Medina, and dishearten his enemies.|$|E

500|$|Dubois first {{published}} his find in 1894. Dubois's central claim was that Pithecanthropus was a transitional form between apes and humans, a so-called [...] "missing link". Many disagreed. Some critics {{claimed that the}} bones were those of an upright walking ape, or that they belonged to a primitive human. <b>This</b> <b>judgment</b> made sense {{at a time when}} an evolutionary view of humanity had not yet been widely accepted, and scientists tended to view hominid fossils as racial variants of modern humans rather than as ancestral forms. After Dubois let a number of scientists examine the fossils in a series of conferences held in Europe in the 1890s, they started to agree that Java Man may be a transitional form after all, but most of them thought of it as [...] "an extinct side branch" [...] of the human tree that had indeed descended from apes, but not evolved into humans. This interpretation eventually imposed itself and remained dominant until the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Many sociologists {{are divided}} into camps of support for {{particular}} research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory.

Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States. In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones {{by a factor of}} two.
