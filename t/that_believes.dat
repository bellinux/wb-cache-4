5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully, distrustful of both Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), circumvents the FBI's investigation into William's kidnapping and performs her own, assisted by Reyes and The Lone Gunmen. Scully discovers that William has been taken by a UFO cult <b>that</b> <b>believes</b> William is destined to become the savior of mankind, but only if Fox Mulder is still alive. If Mulder is dead, William will lead the forces of evil: the alien invaders.|$|E

Jerry Fodor is one of the objectors <b>that</b> <b>believes</b> in folk psychology's success as a theory, because it makes for an effective way of communication in everyday life that can be implemented with few words. Such an effectiveness could never be achieved with a complex neuroscientific terminology.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Debut was generally positive.

For this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society <b>that</b> <b>believes</b> in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that [...] "it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld." ...|$|E

However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor.

2500|$|There are {{basically}} three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related {{to how the}} [...] mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach <b>that</b> <b>believes</b> that singing is largely {{a matter of getting}} the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought <b>that</b> <b>believes</b> that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{interpret}} the First Amendment {{to require the}} exemption that Smith and Black sought, the Court encouraged them to seek redress from the legislature.

40|$|Most agree <b>that</b> <b>believing</b> a {{proposition}} normally or ideally results in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> one <b>believes</b> it, {{at least if}} one considers {{the question of whether}} one believes it. I defend a much stronger thesis. It is impossible to believe without knowledge of one's belief. I argue, roughly, as follows. <b>Believing</b> <b>that</b> p entails that one is able to honestly assert that p. But anyone who is able to honestly assert that p is also able to just say – i. e., authoritatively, yet {{not on the basis of}} evidence – <b>that</b> she <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p. And anyone who is able to just say <b>that</b> she <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p is able to act in light of the fact that she holds that belief. This ability to act, in turn, constitutes knowledge of the psychological fact. However, without a broader theory of belief to help us make sense of this result, this conclusion will be hard to accept. Why should being in a particular mental state by itself necessitate an awareness of being in that state? I sketch a theory that helps to answer this question: believing is a matter of viewing {{a proposition}} as what one ought to believe. I show how this theory explains the thesis <b>that</b> to <b>believe</b> is to know <b>that</b> you <b>believe...</b>|$|R
