25|$|March 19, 2008 {{being the}} fifth anniversary of the United States 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq and in protest and demonstration in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> anti-war protests were held throughout the world including a series of autonomous actions in the United States' capitol, Washington, D.C. in London, Sydney, Australia and the Scottish city of Glasgow with the later three being organized by the UK-based Stop the War Coalition. Actions included demonstrations at government buildings and landmarks, protests at military installations and student-led street blockades. The protests were notable, in part, for mostly replacing mass marches with civil disobedience – including religious-focused protests – and for utilizing new technologies to both coordinate actions and interface with traditional print and broadcast media.|$|E

Charles Kennedy expressed his goal to replace the Conservatives as the official opposition; The Spectator awarded him the 'Parliamentarian of the Year' award in November 2004 for his position on the war. The party won seats from Labour in by-elections in Brent East in 2003 and Leicester South in 2004, and narrowly missed taking others in Birmingham Hodge Hill and Hartlepool.|$|E

[...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, {{it is for me}} one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E
