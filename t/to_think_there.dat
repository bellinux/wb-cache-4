It is possible that not all white-tailed species have been identified.

The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E

Concerning same-sex marriage, Paul has made a distinction between his personal beliefs and how he feels the government should handle it. He has stated that he personally feels same-sex marriage [...] "offends [...] and a lot of people", and said there is a [...] "crisis that allows people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> would be some other sorts of marriage." [...] However, he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide, and would not support a federal ban.|$|E

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|Peter Lavezzoli, {{author of}} The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, has written of Harrison's first solo single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' was {{everything}} that {{people wanted to}} hear in November 1970: shimmering harmonies, lustrous acoustic guitars, a solid Ringo Starr backbeat, and an exquisite [...] guitar solo." [...] Reviewing the single for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called the track [...] "sensational". In an era when songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns [...] "Oh Happy Day" [...] and [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were all worldwide hits, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone observed that the substituting of Harrison's [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] refrain for the trivial [...] "Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang"s of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] was [...] "a sign of the times". John Lennon told a reporter, [...] "Every time I put the radio on, it's 'Oh my Lord' – I'm beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> must be a God." [...] In his December 1970 album review for NME, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and noted that the song [...] "seems to owe something" [...] to [...] "He's So Fine". To Gerson, it was an [...] "obvious re-write" [...] of the Chiffons hit, and within two months US music publisher Bright Tunes had served a writ on Harrison citing unauthorised copyright infringement. In a January 1971 review for NME, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple's delay in releasing the single in the UK, before declaring: [...] "In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney." ...|$|E

2500|$|Heading south through Lynn Canal, Princess Sophia drifted about 1.25 {{miles off}} course, and at 02:00 on 24 October 1918, Princess Sophia struck ground hard on Vanderbilt Reef, 54 {{miles south of}} Skagway. [...] A letter later {{recovered}} {{from the body of}} a passenger, Signal Corps Private Auris W. McQueen (1883–1918), described the scene on board just after the grounding: [...] "Two women fainted and one of them got herself into a black evening dress and didn't worry about who saw her putting it on. [...] Some of the men, too, kept life preservers on {{for an hour or so}} and seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was no chance for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Michael {{embarked}} on a world tour. In Los Angeles, Michael was joined on stage by Aretha Franklin for [...] "I Knew You Were Waiting". It was the second highest grossing event of 1988, earning $17.7million. In February 1989, Faith won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, Michael received the Video Vanguard Award. According to Michael in his film, A Different Story, success did not make him happy and he started <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was something wrong in being an idol for millions of teenage girls. The whole Faith process (promotion, videos, tour, awards) left him exhausted, lonely and frustrated, and far from his friends and family. In 1990, he told his record company Sony that, for his second album, {{he did not want}} to do promotions like the one for Faith.|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene… with in starting <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E
