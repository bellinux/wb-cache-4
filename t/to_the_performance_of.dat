5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E

5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's {{defense was}} {{among the best in}} the country during the regular season, {{finishing}} the year ranked second in total defense (209.3 yards per game) and fifth in scoring defense (13 points per game). The Tar Heels also were ranked second in the country in terms of rushing yards, allowing an average of 77.9 rushing yards per game during the regular season. Those statistics were due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> three consensus first-team All-America defenders: defensive end Greg Ellis, linebacker Brian Simmons and cornerback Dré Bly. Ellis had 87 tackles during the season (18 for loss) to lead the team in both categories. Another defender, linebacker Kivuusama Mays, was a third-team All-American. Simmons in particular felt confident enough to guarantee prior to the game that the Tar Heels would win if they held Virginia Tech to 20 points or less. No team had scored more than that total since the 1995 season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—On-chip {{inductance}} {{effects can}} be used <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> high-speed integrated circuits. Specifically, inductance improves the signal slew rate (the rise time), virtually eliminates short-circuit power consumption and reduces {{the area of the}} active devices and repeaters inserted <b>to</b> optimize <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> long interconnects. These positive effects suggest the development of design strategies that benefit from on-chip inductance. An example of a clock distribution network is presented <b>to</b> illustrate <b>the</b> process in which inductance can be used <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> high-speed integrated circuits...|$|R
