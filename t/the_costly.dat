5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley {{headed a}} {{distinctly}} conciliar government {{and sought to}} introduce the adolescent King into business.

To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E

5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> earlier peace.

The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E

The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, partly because of <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> renovations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E

5|$|In April 1337, Montagu was {{appointed}} to a diplomatic commission to Valenciennes, to establish alliances with Flanders and the German princes. In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing {{the greatest number of}} soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers. In September of that year he was made Marshal of England. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, this office had come into the hands of Norfolk's daughter Margaret. The king did not trust the office with her husband, so he decided instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu. Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and when he left the Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the Earl of Derby. The earl had earlier voiced concerns about <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded <b>the</b> <b>costly</b> construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E
