25|$|The 2005 Kenyan {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 21 November 2005. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> contention in the Constitution review process was how much power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration {{of power in the}} president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by the Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> gender {{equality}} in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can {{read and write}} and only 32.5% of females can read and write. This shows {{that more than half}} of men can read, and less than half of women can read. It also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa.|$|E

500|$|Jolliffe's {{inflammatory}} speech became <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, {{and dominated}} {{coverage in the}} media {{for the rest of}} the election. Drew, and his Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell vehemently denied Jolliffe's accusations, but the public outcry was too much for them to abate. On May 28, 1945 they appointed a Royal Commission to investigate these charges. [...] Jolliffe's CCF and the Ontario Liberal party wanted the election suspended until the Commission tabled its report. [...] Drew ignored these requests and continued to hold the election on its original date, despite it being many months before the Commission's findings could be made available.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{continued}} his provocative approach to journalism, and {{on more than}} one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was [...] "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the conference, but he argued that [...] "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." [...] Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup [...] "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the {{campaign}} was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not [...] "doing something about it". In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using {{what he called a}} [...] "truth bell". Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth. Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race. He carried every congressional district including Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years. His separately selected running mate, Thelma Stovall, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.|$|E
2500|$|The sonnets to {{the young}} man express overwhelming, obsessional love. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> debate has always been whether it {{remained}} platonic or became physical. The first 17 poems, traditionally called the procreation sonnets, are addressed {{to the young}} man urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation. Other sonnets express the speaker's love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's mistress; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are allegorical treatments of Greek epigrams referring to the [...] "little love-god" [...] Cupid.|$|E

Caldwell rated the tag-team title match at 2 and a quarter stars out of five, describing it as [...] "an up-and-down match with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> no reason to view New Day as heels". He gave the United States Championship match 2 and three-quarters out of 5, calling it as a [...] "solid, unspectacular singles match", and wrote that the Divas Championship match [...] "was more of a bridge to what was next" [...] in reference to the appearance of Sasha Banks. Caldwell gave the Rumble main event 3 and three-quarters out of 5, commenting that there were [...] "overall, too many downpoints for this year's Rumble hurting some up-points". He wrote that [...] "the Rumble started really well, got ridiculous in the middle with the now-annual compromise of the Rumble, and ended with the crowd {{not sure what to do}} with the players in the mix outside of Ambrose".|$|E

6000|$|... [6] [See Quarterly Review, March, 1812, vol. vii. p. 191: [...] "The {{moral code}} of chivalry was not, we admit, quite pure and spotless, but its laxity on some points was {{redeemed}} by the noble spirit of gallantry which courted personal {{danger in the}} defence of the sovereign ... of women because they are often lovely, and always helpless; and of the priesthood.... Now, Childe Harold, if not absolutely craven and recreant, {{is at least a}} mortal enemy to all martial exertion, a scoffer at the fair sex, and, apparently, disposed to consider all religions as different modes of superstition." [...] The tone of the review is severer than the Preface indicates.
