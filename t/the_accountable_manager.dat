The proposed draft rule and acceptable means of compliance (NPA 2008 - 22 c) have been reviewed, commercial airline operators were surveyed, and relevant published literature on the subject was also identified and reviewed. The operator survey produced {{a very small number}} of responses (nine in total). The small sample size doesn’t give a high degree of confidence in the results, although the sample did cover a variety of types of operator. It was concluded that most organisations did have the ultimate accountability for safety resting with <b>the</b> <b>Accountable</b> <b>Manager,</b> which in some cases was the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer. The safety departments were also generally organised separately from operational delivery.

30|$|Alexander, an {{entrepreneurial}} person in his mid-thirties, {{has worked as}} a project manager for a few years. The purpose of his team’s innovation project was to develop an automatic detection system of people by measuring body form and body heat (3 D and infrared) on a conveyer belt system. He and his team members joined the project at a late stage, inheriting the task from their predecessors. The predecessors had already performed the feasibility study and defined the scope of the project, and the new team continued from the point where the old team had left off. Along the way, several critical incidents occurred, in the form of technical setbacks to do with camera hardware, image processing and the software from an external supplier. At a certain point, the project reached an impasse. <b>The</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>manager</b> wanted the team to continue according to plan, because so much had already been invested and the business case still seemed valid. However, Alexander sensed that the original plan would not work and wanted to find alternative ways, exploring other avenues that might be more fruitful. He started meetings with other R&D people, organized a work session with his team, and soon some new ideas emerged, which he wanted to test. ‘A conversation of one hour with a software developer resulted in a new concept, which we explored further with the team.’ Yet <b>the</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>manager</b> wanted the team to continue with the original plan, which the team duly did, until a few months later, when they reached a dead end. This opened the way to present the new ideas to the management team, who soon grew convinced of the possibilities. Alexanders’ reflection-in-action was to try and change tack when he sensed the old idea would not work and a new idea seemed more promising. He consulted others on the validity of his hunches and gradually developed new ideas. He let the team prepare presentations supported by the evidence needed for the management team to be convinced of the worth of changing course. The evidence-based presentations were important to persuade both the project manager and the management team.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe current {{focus on}} {{sustainable}} development is again raising interest in {{corporate social responsibility}} {{at a time when}} the emphasis on shareholder value is reaching an apogee. The aim here is to analyze the extent to which a corporate social responsibility strategy impacts the management control systems of multinational companies. After a review of the literature and an exploratory study, a conceptual framework was developed, leading us to the idea that social management control systems are directly linked to the ideals, discourses, and programs of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. Two detailed multi-site case studies were then completed. These case studies revealed that developing social management control systems are in conflict with the still predominant financial control systems. Social management control systems integrate stakeholders into their routines, reinforce internal cohesion, and progressively create <b>the</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>manager</b> whose attention focuses on the long term. This outcome brings enrichment to corporate social responsibility theory by showing that it is managerial and that the corporation and its stakeholders are necessarily linked for the construction of a sustainable development project...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Severe {{flooding}} in Queensland, Australia in late 2010 and into February of 2011 resulted in significant losses to infrastructure, equipment and coal production. Xstrata Coal (XC) mines suffered {{billions of dollars}} worth of losses, resulting in insurance premiums increasing drastically in subsequent months. These events prompted Xstrata‟s top management to reconsider {{the way in which they}} managed risk. Initial revelations were that the focus of Risk Management had largely been on the areas of Health and Safety and that, particularly in South Africa, the outcome of all management‟s efforts to manage risk had been to comply with the relevant legislation. There was clearly an attempt to avoid litigation resulting in potential prosecution. The most stringent of this legislation was that of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 24 of 996), as promulgated by the Department of Mineral Resources. The requirements were prescriptive to the extent that mine management was required to utilise the Hazard Identification Risk Assessment process to identify hazards, assess the associated risk and apply mitigation, largely in order to prevent incidents which could affect the health and safety of employees. Little regard was given to the fact that mining houses could endure severe financial losses as a result of catastrophic events, which could stop production for significant periods of time. Whilst Xstrata did recognise Business Continuity Risk (BCR), the risk assessment process which was introduced along with the CURA risk register displayed a distinct division between Health and Safety Risk and BCR. Furthermore, this was not a systematic process. Initial risk categories were prescribed by XC mainly based on experiences in Australia. The floods prompted a rethink and Xstrata‟s prescription to conduct business continuity risk assessments (BCRAs) coincided perfectly with this writer‟s exposure to the Enterprise Risk Management Elective at the University of Stellenbosch‟s Business School. As the General Manager of the iMpunzi Complex that comprises three coalmines, it was the responsibility of the writer to carry out the instruction to review the business continuity process. Consequently, the research is intended to assess the current Risk Management environment within Xstrata Coal South Africa by means of an analysis of current documentation and interviews with select key personnel who largely influence and impact the management of risk in the company. Thereafter, the study will progress to the methodology involved in the Risk Assessments, followed by an assessment of the knowledge, skills and qualifications required for <b>the</b> relevant, <b>accountable</b> <b>managers</b> appointed to manage the risks. The findings of the research were that whilst there was quite a rigid framework, which was aligned with ISO 31000 principles for risk management, there were shortcomings in the methodology of the risk assessment process, as well as the considerations for dealing with latent or residual risk. To this extent, the writer recommended: A risk assessment template which prescribes, but is not limited to, the hazards which may be prevalent on a coal mine, including hazards specific to iMpunzi Complex; A revised template for the Risk Treatment Plan, which takes cognisance of Residual Risk; Other recommendations, which may deal with minor findings of the study...|$|R
