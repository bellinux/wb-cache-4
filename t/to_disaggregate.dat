25|$|Mineral {{processing}} (or mineral dressing) is {{a specialized}} {{area in the}} science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material). Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing may be necessary <b>to</b> <b>disaggregate</b> (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, {{whether it is a}} surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.|$|E

We also adjusted the number of months of receipt on the basis of differences between the data and simulated values. Our method also highlighted a number of data quality issues in relation to the inclusion of some payments such as redundancy lump sums within social transfer variables. This methodology is potentially applicable to other countries too and thus could be utilised to develop the EU-SILC for microsimulation purposes.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that universities are key institutions in {{national and regional}} systems of innovation.

However, relatively little attention has been devoted <b>to</b> <b>disaggregating</b> the 'industry' side of this relationship and examining the costs and benefits <b>to</b> the <b>disaggregated</b> parties involved. In the present article, which draws on an analytical and empirical study from Scotland, it is suggested that it makes sense to distinguish between three kinds of firms in analysing the university-industry relationship: large national and international R&D-intensive firms, university spin-out firms, and established small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have had little interaction with universities. The different costs and benefits facing these firms in their interactions with universities are analysed. It is concluded that the established SMEs confront relatively high costs in relating to universities. Finally, the policy implications are explored.

The estimation approach accounts for firm heterogeneity and selection bias in a panel-data framework.

50|$|The {{decline of}} soil {{structure}} under irrigation is usually {{related to the}} breakdown of aggregates and dispersion of clay material {{as a result of}} rapid wetting. This is particularly so if soils are sodic; that is, having a high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of the cations attached to the clays. High sodium levels (compared to high calcium levels) cause particles to repel one another when wet, and the associated aggregates <b>to</b> <b>disaggregate</b> and disperse.

The share of both investment and employment in import competing industries has, on the other hand, fallen. These changes in the sectoral allocation of resources are consistent with the specialisation in production that accompanies international integration. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{taxation}} of {{carried interest}} {{has been an}} issue since the mid-2000s, particularly as the compensation earned by certain investors increased along with the sizes of private equity and hedge funds. Historically, carried interest has been treated as a capital gain for tax purposes in most jurisdictions. The reason for this treatment is that a fund manager would make a substantial commitment of his own capital into the fund and carried interest would represent {{a portion of the}} manager's return on that investment. While hedge funds typically trade their investments actively, private equity firms tend to hold their investments for many years. Thus, capital gains from private equity funds typically qualify as long-term capital gains, which receive favorable tax treatment in many jurisdictions. Critics of this tax treatment seek <b>to</b> <b>disaggregate</b> the returns directly related to the capital contributed by the fund manager from the carried interest allocated from the other investors in the fund to the fund manager.|$|E
