500|$|Upon the {{receiving}} {{of the news}} that democracy has come to Iraq, one scene shows a man having a knife held to his throat, which caused some controversy after the episode was broadcast. Stewie also knowingly breaks the fourth wall in the episode, by speaking in a manner {{as if he were}} talking to the audience. In one scene, Stewie mentions the time [...] "Peter went after that hockey coach" [...] (making a veiled reference to [...] "Hockey Dad" [...] Thomas Junta), in the expectation of a cutaway gag. However, nothing happens, and Stewie comments, [...] "Oh, no clip? <b>Thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> clip". This scene was described as being a one off.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where we really <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> franchise where we could see 100 episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E

2500|$|With 3:35 left to play, Iowa {{attempted}} a trick play – an attempted flanker pass that has posed problems for Texas all season. [...] Safety Marcus Griffin stuffed the play for an 11-yard loss. [...] Commenting on stopping the trick play, Griffin said, [...] "I {{knew it was}} coming – we'd been beaten by that play in the last 10 games. We knew it had to come, I guess that was the best time for it." [...] Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz described the call as [...] "totally my fault. I was being greedy, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> secure play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{football}} matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005 a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa and forced fans to either stand out {{in the parking lot}} and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum. [...] It created such an atmosphere that Iowa State was able to win over the favored Buffaloes 30–16. [...] When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough sailing. <b>We</b> did {{not want}} to overdo the thing and get a surfeit of it. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sail—a good all-round exciting, {{interesting}} sail—and now <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> row, just for a change like.|$|R

She could only do so, however, by harking back--as {{if it had been}} a fascination. She might have been wishing, under this renewed, this still more suggestive visitation, to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again, for the softness of the water, into the contracted basin of the past. [...] "We talked about it--we talked about it; you don't remember so well as I. You too didn't know-- and it was beautiful of you; like Kitty and Dotty you too <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> position, and were surprised when I thought we ought to have told them we weren't doing for them what they supposed. In fact," [...] Maggie pursued, [...] "we're not doing it now. We're not, you see, really introducing them. I mean not to the people they want." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} Miss Fairlie {{until later}} in the day, at dinner-time. She was not looking well, and I was sorry to observe it. She is a sweet lovable girl, as amiable and {{attentive}} to every one about her as her excellent mother used to be--though, personally speaking, she takes after her father. Mrs. Fairlie had dark eyes and hair, and her elder daughter, Miss Halcombe, strongly reminds me of her. Miss Fairlie played {{to us in the}} evening--not so well as usual, I <b>thought.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rubber at whist, a mere profanation, so far as play was concerned, of that noble game. I had been favourably impressed by Mr. Hartright on our first introduction to one another, but I soon discovered that he was not free from the social failings incidental to his age. There are three things that none of the young men of the present generation can do. They can't sit over their wine, they can't play at whist, and they can't pay a lady a compliment. Mr. Hartright was no exception to the general rule. Otherwise, even in those early days and on that short acquaintance, he struck me as being a modest and gentlemanlike young man.|$|E
5000|$|A teenage {{version of}} Princess Leia, voiced by Julie Dolan, {{appears in a}} 2016 episode of the {{animated}} series Star Wars Rebels, which is set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. In the episode, Leia is sent on a secret mission to assist the titular rebels. Executive producer Dave Filoni said of the appearance: <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to show her learning to be a leader, experimenting with the personality that becomes the stronger more resolute character you see in A New Hope. One of the complex challenges of depicting Leia in Rebels is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to remind the audience {{that at this point}} she is part of the Empire. She doesn't believe in the Empire, but she is acting the part, almost a double agent.|$|R

5000|$|General Gowon {{accepted}} that the Games had been won by [...] "a better presentation" [...] but [...] "The {{size of the}} vote for Glasgow was a surprise.

5000|$|Stenhouse, who rebounded from {{hitting the}} wall {{early in the}} race to finish fourth, said he [...] "had to fight hard for this top-five. I made a mistake early.

60|$|With {{this purpose}} in view, I said, one morning, that I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all earned <b>a</b> little holiday {{and a change}} of scene. After some consideration, {{it was decided that}} we should go for a {{fortnight}} to the sea-side.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the game}} coach Priore commented saying “Tonight {{was a real}} good victory for us,” and added “I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> solid game plan which was {{executed}} well.

Essington commented on his successful start by saying [...] "Coming off the bye week allowed us to get in some great work”. Essington will remain quarterback {{for the rest of}} the season.|$|E
5000|$|I {{stepped back}} and said to Smoky, [...] "Well, shoot him." [...] Smoky said, [...] "No, I will miss him. You shoot him," [...] {{at the same time}} handing me the gun. I now saw that Smoky was in earnest and surely <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bear and I burst out with laughter. Smoky was amazed and said, [...] "You {{blooming}} simpleton, what is the matter with you?" [...] The look of anxiety {{and the manner in which}} Smoky spoke still caused me to laugh the harder.|$|E
5000|$|... "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{really good}} car {{coming into the}} race today. We took off and {{struggled}} {{a little bit with}} rear grip, and worked all day to get the grip level right. About halfway through that next to last run, my car got really happy and took off. I’m proud of us for getting the car right at the right time. About 15 laps into that next to last run, Jimmie cleared Logano and got really fast. He was just a little quicker than we were today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter on December 12, {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of a Republican debate in Iowa, Huckabee personally apologized to Romney. The next morning on MSNBC Huckabee said, [...] "It was never my intention to denigrate his faith... I raised it not to create a story. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> simple, casual conversation... I don't think his Mormon faith should {{have anything to do with}} him being elected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't we? It {{was just}} in time for the skating," [...] said Jock. [...] "Only the worst of it is, {{everybody}} will come to the lake, and so mother won't learn to skate. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> found <b>a</b> jolly little place in the wood, where <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> had some fun with her, but they found it out, though we halloed as loud as ever we could to keep them off." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{they came}} up one to another; and {{presently}} Stand-fast said to old Honest, Ho, father Honest, are you there? Aye, said he, that I am, as sure as you are there. Right glad am I, said Mr. Stand-fast, that I have found you on this road. And as glad am I, said the other, that I espied you upon your knees. Then Mr. Stand-fast blushed, and said, But why, did you see me? Yes, that I did, quoth the other, and with my heart was glad at the sight. Why, what did you think? said Stand-fast. Think! said old Honest, what should I think? I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> honest man upon the road, and therefore should have his company by and by. If you thought not amiss [said Stand-fast], how happy am I; but if I be not as I should, I alone must bear it. That is true, said the other; but your fear doth further confirm me, that things are right betwixt the Prince of Pilgrims and your soul; for, saith he, 'Blessed is the man that feareth always.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Teammate Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was 17th {{with four}} {{to go and}} rallied to a fourth-place finish. [...] "We've just got to work harder," [...] he said. [...] "Our car wasn't very good all weekend in the corner. We {{had a lot of}} balance issues we never really cured. That held us up. We weren't as good as we were here earlier this year. But still, it was a top-10, top-five car, but just barely a top-five car. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good enough car to win here when we came here earlier in the summer, but we lost a little balance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kahne {{admitted}} that {{his chances of}} winning the championship were over after his lap 13 crash: [...] "We all <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shot to win the Nextel Cup, but you can't have two rough weeks I don't think. We'd have to win the final eight races to win the Cup." [...] However, Kahne hoped that he would win more races before the season ended. Stewart was upset for damaging Kahne's car: [...] "Wrecking is one thing, but when you take out somebody that's in the Chase, you've screwed up a whole team's year by one race." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lenovo had {{expressed}} interest in acquiring Motorola's hardware business immediately after it had been acquired by Google. Three years later, Lenovo's successful bid for Motorola Mobility began with {{a phone call from}} Eric Schmidt, asking if Lenovo was still interested in an acquisition. Lenovo immediately expressed interest. Liu Jun, an executive vice president at Lenovo in charge of mobile devices, said, [...] "We first approached Moto when Google first announced the acquisition. Google was the owner of Android and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> maybe it wouldn't want to own the hardware side of the business," [...] said Liu Jun, EVP President of mobile for Lenovo to TechRadar. To us, it was clear that Google wanted to own the IPs. So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to own the hardware side. Google initially tried to do the hardware itself but then {{a year and a half}} later they reconsidered their strategy. The end of last year we got a call from Google, from Eric Schmidt.
