The main disadvantage of employing water-miscible solvents is that at high concentrations, many enzymes are relatively inactive or denatured due to the stripping of enzyme-bound water. ³ The use of proteinases isolated from extreme thermophiles, with their inherent stability to extremes of pH and temperature and to organic solvents, would seem to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> solving these problems.

From a common starting point, the assessment home, I have by means of continual interviews followed fourteen youngsters, six girls and eight boys, for almost {{three years in the}} boundary zone between "the normal life" and "the deviating behaviour". In the assessment home they where defined as socially vulnerable and problematical. I was able to establish co-operation, got close and through narratives, gain insight into the "order" they gave themselves for experiences, thoughts and identity in choices of lifestyles. My interest was focused on life historical narratives and their own version of events. Even if different choices and lifestyles are experienced as individual they are not only a personal construction. Choosing is also <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> doing gender, making a place for one's own thread, weaving it into the collective warp. Gender and reality differences leads to gender specific choices. Females gave priority to Intimacy before Identity and the males gave priority to Identity before Intimacy. I also found two types of social inheritance and life history scenarios that gave structure to choices and orientations. Choices of lifestyles were related to social action, ways of doing gender, dealing with social inheritance in situational ways. In an individual way actions {{had much to do with}} "a play around self-esteem" in which habits and routinized practice provided security and self-confidence. The power of habit gave security to create and recreate known figures even if the figures generated fear and respect in others' eyes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} auctions can optimally coordinate subproblems arising from decentralized approaches to chemical engineering problems by viewing {{interactions between the}} subproblems as demands for limited resources. Auctions do this by finding prices over plant resources, like purity and heat content, which process units {{need in order to}} maximize their individual profits. A proof is presented that when auctions terminate with equilibrium prices—prices which balance the supply and demand of resources—the decisions that maximize individual profits maximize the overall profit of the entire system as well. ^ There are, however, cases where equilibrium prices do not exist. One such instance occurs when some subproblems are described by linear programs. This dissertation describes why this problem exists, and it proves that a type of pseudo-equilibrium can be restored using a form of nonlinear pricing called augmented pricing. A more serious form of equilibrium failure occurs when one tries to coordinate divisions in chemical plants. Standard decomposition techniques like Lagrangean substitution have difficulty with these types of problems because <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> defining interprocess resources is flawed. The difficulty can be overcome by defining resources properly. This leads to a new type of resource called slack resources —the absolute difference between what upstream and downstream divisions want the states of the interprocess streams to be. Slack resources restore the concept of equilibrium resource prices which in turn allows divisions in chemical plants to be optimally coordinated. ^ Prices over slack resources provide a dollar measurement of the costs of divisional interaction. They can be used to design control systems which maximize dollar performance by balancing the costs of controller error and controller action throughout the plant. These cost-oriented control systems outperform generically designed control systems because the relative importance of the controllers is incorporated implicitly via the slack prices. Slack resource ideas can also be applied beyond process streams. Using the concept of courtesy constraints and generalized slack resources, plant divisions can express their preferences over anything in a chemical plant. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that {{a large portion of}} the {{existing}} building stock in Norway is regarded as under-designed with respect to snow load. Unfortunately, few solutions are available for reducing heavy snow loads occurring on roofs to this date and building owners often rely on shoveling snow off the roof in a heavy snowfall scenario. The PV-heating system intends to be a modern solution for snow load reduction. The system functions by sending current back into the PV-modules, inducing a heat flow at the module surface, allowing for snow load reduction. This thesis combines measurements and theoretical analysis to investigate the PV-heating system. The objective is to uncover how feasible a PV-heating system is for reducing snow loads in a sub-arctic climate. The measurements and analysis were performed with the specific intent to document the load reducing capabilities of a PV-heating system operating under varying climatic conditions. Different strategies for the snow load reduction are investigated. Melting the snow is <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> reducing the load. Sublimation, the instant transition from solid to vapor, serves as an alternative to melting, conducive under different climatic conditions. Several experiments were performed, including the test of a full scale PV-heating system and a case study with single modules. Through additional research questions, the thesis also explores the system’s relation to current laws and design regulation, and if melting snow on the module surface can result in higher solar gains. The results indicate that the potential of reducing snow loads with a PV-heating system is existent. Melting snow on the module surface is unproblematic, but the transportation of water from the roof surface can be challenging. The snow’s capability for water-saturation and the freezing of water at the roof can result in insufficient load reduction. A drainage system with heated gutters is recommended to ensure proper load reduction for the roof. Tests of sublimating the snow also showed potential. A sublimation amount of 0. 86 kg/m 2 per day was achieved during a case study in Nordmarka, Oslo. To truly uncover the potential of load reduction by sublimation, further research is recommended. An automation of the system, implementing live data measured on site and weather forecast, is considered advantageous to optimize ablation and save energy. Melting snow on the module surface allows for enhancing solar gains during the winter season. This thesis weighs the energy used to melt the snow against the potential of producing energy during winter. The results of analysis and theoretical calculation are indicative of an existing potential of enhanced solar gains and a possible new application of the system. The relation to the law and design regulations is also investigated to consider how the system can be implemented in existing and new buildings. The thesis concludes that further documentation of the system’s load reduction capabilities is needed to integrate the system into the design regulations and to establish of a legal precedent for the system...|$|E

Clearly, the more complex the immunological universe is thought to be, the higher becomes the number of different clones required by the hypothesis, and the lower becomes the expected frequency of a cell belonging to one particular clone.

40|$|Morita {{equivalence}} is {{a general}} way of classifying structures by means of their actions that is weaker than isomorphism {{but at the same}} time useful. It arose first in the study of unital rings in the 1950 ’s [35] but has since been extended to many other kinds of strucures, including classes of non- unital rings. It was first applied to semigroup theory in the 1970 ’s in the work of Banaschewski [5] and Knauer [19] who independently determined when two monoids were Morita equivalent. However they were unable to extend their definition to arbitrary semigroups since Banaschewski showed that Morita equivalence reduced to isomorphism. It was not until the 1990 ’s that Talwar [40, 41] was able to find a good definition of Morita equivalence for a class of semigroups that included all monoids but also all regular semigroups: the class of semigroups with local units. Such a semigroup is one in which each element has a left and a right idempotent identity. Talwar’s work was not developed further until the twenty-first century when a variety of mathematicians including Funk, Laan, Lawson, M´arki and Steinberg started to develop the Morita theory of semigroups in detail [9, 20, 25, 39]. Our thesis takes as its starting point Lawson’s reinterpretation of Talwar’s work. The thesis consists of three chapters. An essential ingredient in Morita theory is the notion of an equivalence of categories. For this reason, Chapter 1 of this thesis reviews all the categorical definitions needed. In Chapter 2, we describe in detail the work of Banaschewski and Knauer on the Morita theory of monoids. These two chapters contain no new work. We begin Chapter 3 by explaining why <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> defining the Morita equivalence of two semigroups does not work. We then describe Lawson’s approach to Talwar’s work. This provides the foundation for our thesis. Our new contributions to the theory are contained in Sections 3. 2, 3. 3 and 3. 4 and are based on Rees matrix semigroups. Talwar showed that the classical Rees matrix theorem for completely simple semigroups could be regarded as a Morita theorem: a semigroup is Morita equivalent to a group if and only if it is completely simple if and only if it is isomorphic to a Rees matrix semigroup over a group. This raises the question of determining what role Rees matrix semigroups play in the Morita theory of semigroups with local units. We investigate three different problems based on this idea: Section 3. 2 In this section, we try to provean exact generalisation of the Rees theorem. We are interested in the case where S is Morita equivalent to T if and only if S is isomorphic to some kind of Rees matrix semigroup over T. Section 3. 3 In this section, we prove that S is Morita equivalent to T if and only if S is a locally isomorphic image of a special kind of Rees matrix semigroup over T. This result was first proved by Laan and M´arki [20] but we give a new proof that generalizes the classical proof of the Rees theorem. Section 3. 4 Finally, we solve the following problem: given an inverse semi-group S find all inverse semigroups T which are Morita equivalent to S. Our solution uses special kinds of Rees matrix semigroups over S. In this section, we also describe those semigroups which are Morita equivalent to semigroups with commuting idempotents. This builds on early work by Khan and Lawson [17, 18]...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} aiming {{to go through}} and study the most {{important}} and frequently mentioned terms and titles used in the letters of Paul to denote and describe God, the Father, the Son and the Spirit. These include “Christ” and “Lord” as well. The purpose has been two-fold: on the one hand I wished to study the background and meaning of the concepts in question, as used by Paul; on the other hand – and this has been my main concern – I specifically wanted to look at what kind of language Paul uses to denote Father, Son and Spirit in terms of their attributed characteristics, roles and theological functions. The questions are focused on if it is possible to identify specific and unique attributions, for example made to the Father, which are not attributed to the Son or the Spirit and vice versa. And if there are ways in which the decriptions overlap each other, in terms of characteristics, roles or functions. What makes for example talk about the Father {{different from that of the}} Spirit; and are there any kind of linguistic tensions in Pauls' way of describing God and his actions? The main sources used to answer these questions have, of course, been the letters in the canon of the New Testament ascribed to, and read by the church as written by Paul the apostle. I have studied the corpus as a whole, but I also wanted to let the individual passages and even whole letters be interpreted (as far as possible) with a sensibility for the narrower contexts in which they stand. I read through the letters and identified where, how often and in what way Paul uses the different terms – written apart from each other as well as together. I primarily used the official swedish translation Bibel 2000 by Bibelkommissionen, but where there in comparison with other translations seemed to be different options at hand, I consulted the greek text as presented in Novum Testamentum Graece by Nestle-Aland. Secondary literature consists primarily of well-known and recognized bible commentaries, books and exegetical dictionaries by for example Joseph A. Fitzmyer, James D. G. Dunn, Martin Hengel, Ferdinand Hahn, Gerhard Schneider, N. T. Wright etc. What I have found in my study is that Paul uses the terms and titles in a way that, on the one hand carefully and in somewhat systematically seeks to describe them as distinct from one another. First in <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> denoting them as Father, Son and Spirit (the Son is not called the Father and the Spirit is not the Son, and so forth); and secondly they are given different theological roles and functions in the salvation history. The Spirit did not for example take on flesh and die for the sins of humanity, and the Son did not raise from the dead by himself. Prayer and thanksgiving, likewise, seems only to be offered to God, the Father, and never the Spirit or Christ, even though the proper way of praying and giving thanks to Him, according to Paul, is through or in the name of Jesus Christ and in the Spirit. But on the other hand Paul uses a language that makes it impossible to understand God only in such a categorical and distinguishing way. In several ways he talks about Father, Son and Spirit with an overlapping language of description when it comes their theological characteristics, roles and functions. The Father is known as “Father” in relation to the Son, and it is always God, the Father who is said to act in, with and through the Son and the Spirit. The Son and the Spirit never works by, or for them selves in opposition with God's will, but are constantly fulfilling God's purposes and pointing at the glorification and importance of him or one another. Paul's use of the terms makes it obvious that they as Father, Son and Spirit is fully interdependent on each other. God the Father appears and reveals himself through and in the Son and the Spirit. And in turn, the Son and the Spirit enables experience, availability and revelation or understanding of each other and of the Father. Paul's christology would have no grounds or relevance if there were no patriology; and likewise his patriology would be rather abstract and unsatisfactory without his pneumatology of the Spirit as God's renewed presence amongst his people. Therefor, for Paul, talk about God is necessarily talk about Father, Son and Spirit...|$|E

In the asymmetric case, we know that semantic security is impossible by deterministic systems, but [9] showed how to achieve it by probabilistic means. For (symmetric) block ciphers, we can easily see that <b>the</b> most <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> using it, Electronic Codebook Mode (ECB), is not semantically secure either. For instance, it is [...] ...|$|R

A proper joint selection and detailed design, however, will require quantitative results obtained in an objective and reproducible procedure. The objective {{of this paper was}} to develop benchmark procedures and results for the characterization of joining methods for composite materials. AS 4 carbon/PEEK joints (UD tape) were manufactured in T-configurations by autoclave processing. Two types of T-joints were co-consolidated on the skin, from a flat strip with an injection molded nugget (“butt joint”) or from a pre-consolidated T-stiffener, respectively. RTD, CTD and HW experiments were performed on both types of configurations. The pre-consolidated T-stiffeners have a higher pull-off load and more gradual damage development than the flat strip/nugget configuration, at the cost of added mass. Also here CTD and RTD performances are similar, whereas the flat strip/nugget configuration shows no significant strength reduction in HW conditions, against 30 % for the pre-consolidated T-stiffener configuration...|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{difficulty}} in meshing these theories at all energy scales comes from the different assumptions that these theories make on how the universe works. Quantum field theory, if conceived of as a theory of particles, depends on particle fields embedded in the flat space-time of special relativity. General relativity models gravity as a curvature within space-time that changes as a gravitational mass moves. Historically, <b>the</b> most <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> combining <b>the</b> two (such as treating gravity as simply another particle field) ran quickly into {{what is known as}} the renormalization problem. In the old-fashioned understanding of renormalization, gravity particles would attract each other and adding together all of the interactions results in many infinite values which cannot easily be cancelled out mathematically to yield sensible, finite results. This is in contrast with quantum electrodynamics where, given that the series still do not converge, the interactions sometimes evaluate to infinite results, but those are few enough in number to be removable via renormalization. Another possibility is to focus on fields rather than on particles, which are just one <b>way</b> <b>of</b> characterizing certain fields in very special spacetimes. This solves worries about consistency, but does not appear to lead to a quantized version of full general theory of relativity.|$|R
40|$|The {{recurrent}} {{question about}} angels {{is whether they}} exist. Those who have had an encounter with them need no further proof; they received it. Sceptics however are still wanting for evidence. One such proof could readily be obtained. To begin, let us recall what is already known. <b>The</b> most <b>obvious</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> obtaining such a proof is to connect directly with ones Guardian angel or Personnal guide, receiving messages mostly {{in the form of}} significant synchronicities, as the psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung called them, sometimes in more tangible ways; occasionally one may even see him or her. (On the spiritual plane there is no sex nor gender; sexuated reproduction and the differenciation between male and female is a particularity of the material plane). Numerous books and persons teach such techniques, although this means learning to trust one’s intuition, which sceptics find difficult to do. Often they do not even bother to seriously inform themselves about these topics, which they so vehemently criticize and denigrate. Thus, trained mediums, channels and clear-sighted persons report numerous messages from other realms and encounters with various spirits, not just angels (who are good spirits). The Bible and other holy scriptures report interventions by angels, which still occu...|$|R
