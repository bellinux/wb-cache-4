5|$|Although Mr. Bean is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> {{character}} in the programme, others appear, usually as foils for his various antics. Other than his girlfriend there are more characters in each episode. However, several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in sketches as various one-off supporting characters, including Owen Brenman, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Stephen Frost, Nick Hancock, Christopher Ryan, Paul Bown, Caroline Quentin, Danny La Rue, Roger Lloyd-Pack, David Schneider and Richard Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> one being a {{specimen}} that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The only reason the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the rocks are the same age as the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E

5|$|Somerset {{is largely}} rural {{and the two}} main centres of population, Bath and Weston-super-Mare, were {{transferred}} to the unitary authority districts of Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset respectively, in 1996 but are still part of the ceremonial county. The Somerset Levels are liable to flooding and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> towns are Glastonbury and Street which occupy slightly elevated locations on the Polden Hills.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} runs {{in its own}} right-of-way on a route {{similar to}} that of the Dulles Access Road, running both at grade and via aerial structures. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> diversions from the access road route are for the stops in Tysons Corner and at Dulles International Airport, where the Metro is currently planned to alternate between subway and elevated track to maintain the exclusive right-of-way.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> Christian {{success of}} the Second Crusade came to a {{combined}} force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the Holy Land, the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon, expelling its Moorish occupants.|$|E

Even after this, {{the river is}} isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In this stretch is Garston Lock, the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.|$|E
5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the wireless station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E
5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It {{was the beginning of}} the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> obstacle remaining.|$|E

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1796 French and allied forces had been almost {{completely}} driven from the Indian Ocean, most of the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic falling to British invasions during 1795. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> French presence was on Île de France {{and a few other}} nearby islands, from which a squadron of two frigates periodically operated against British trade. The British were so confident of supremacy that they had split their forces, with a large squadron based at Simon's Town in the Cape Colony of Southern Africa under Sir George Keith Elphinstone and a smaller dispersed force operating under Peter Rainier in the Dutch East Indies, based at the captured port of Malacca. The important trading ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were largely undefended, as were the valuable trade routes which supported them.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from road haulage to the point at which coal deliveries were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> business.|$|E
25|$|With {{ever more}} traffic going by rail, <b>the</b> canal's <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> weapon was low tolls. While this slowed {{the decline in}} volumes, it did so only by large {{reductions}} in income, and consideration was given to amalgamations with other canals.|$|R
50|$|Within the Dakar 'region, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{politically}} <b>significant</b> units (i.e. {{those who}} have elected officials and wield a significant power) are: the 7 communes, the 2 communautés rurales, and the 43 communes d'arrondissement.|$|R

5|$|Cui Shi's book Simin yueling (四民月令) is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> {{surviving}} work {{on agriculture}} from the Eastern Han period, though about 3,000 written {{characters of the}} Fan Shengzhi shu (氾勝之書), dated to the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (33–7 BC), still survive. Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship, festival and religious holiday celebrations, conduct for family and kinship relations, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times {{to buy and sell}} certain types of farm-produced goods.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Kawachi and Settsu {{were named}} after ancient Japanese provinces, both now {{a part of}} Osaka prefecture. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> action {{performed}} by either ship during World War I was when they bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during {{the final stage of}} the Battle of Tsingtao. They were both assigned to the First Squadron until they were refitted in 1917 and 1916 respectively. Upon their completion of their refits, both ships were assigned to the Second Squadron. On 12 July 1918, Kawachi was sunk in an accidental magazine explosion in Tokuyama Bay that killed over 600 crewmen. Stricken from the Navy List on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for a century and a half. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E

5000|$|The Camp is {{the term}} used in the Falkland Islands to refer to {{any part of the}} islands outside <b>the</b> islands' <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> town, Stanley, and often the large RAF base at Mount Pleasant. It is derived from the Spanish word campo, for [...] "countryside".|$|R
5|$|For many years, Accum's {{establishment}} was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> {{institution in}} England that provided lectures {{on the theory}} of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum's teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, his laboratory {{was the first in}} Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor to Yale University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London. Accum's biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum's London business.|$|E
5|$|Her husband's {{early death}} in 1962 forced Stokes {{to return to}} {{painting}} as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and {{was the subject of}} a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery and Geelong Art Gallery in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other women artists including Grace Cossington Smith and Clarice Beckett, but her fortunes were revived somewhat as a central figure in Anne Summers' 2009 book The Lost Mother. Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria; the Art Gallery of New South Wales is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> Australian collecting institution not to hold one of her works.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic Ocean, the {{greatest}} concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. Florida {{is the most popular}} nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde Islands are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> nesting site on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil.|$|E
