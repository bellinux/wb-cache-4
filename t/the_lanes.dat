5|$|In Hasbrouck Heights, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> {{split with}} the Bendix Diner located between the traffic lanes at the {{intersection}} of County Route 40 (Williams Avenue), the last traffic light on Route 17 before the New York state line. At the interchange with U.S. Route 46, which only features access to the eastbound direction of U.S. Route 46, Route 17 drops to two lanes in each direction and continues north with <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> merging back together as the road interchanges with County Route 55 (Terrace Avenue) at an interchange. The road enters Hackensack with <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> splitting again for the long interchange with Interstate 80. Along this strip, the road is again three lanes in each direction and includes an interchange with County Route 57 (Summit Avenue), crossing into Lodi. <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> rejoin upon splitting from Interstate 80 with a lane dropping in each direction at the County Route 56 (Essex Street) interchange on the Maywood border. Route 17 continues north as a congested road through commercial areas, crossing into Rochelle Park where the route interchanges with County Route 62 (Passaic Street) at mile marker 11.46 before entering Paramus.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, {{and climbs}} out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the three}} {{original}} HOV lanes in Ontario opened on Highway404 in late 2005; {{the other two were}} <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> on Highway403. In early 2004, construction began on a new ramp to westbound Highway401, curving beneath the southbound lanes of Highway404. On 13 December 2005, the southbound HOV lane was opened to traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this report, we {{introduce}} a mono-vision based lane detection method (pure mono-vision without the aide {{of any other}} sensor). <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> detection method consists of <b>the</b> sub-parts of <b>lane</b> mark segment extraction, lane model fitting, and <b>lane</b> tracking. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> mark segment extractor is based on some criteria that are only related to the inherent physical properties of <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> marks. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> model is parameterized in the world (the ground plane) reference instead of in the image reference. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> tracking is {{carried out in the}} framework of the particle filter, including the evolution and the update of <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> state; a mechanism that executes on-line estimation of the vehicle pitch angle is naturally incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> tracking process. Read-data tests are given to demonstrate the performance of <b>the</b> mono-vision based <b>lane</b> detection method.

5|$|After {{splitting}} from I-295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane {{divided road}} called Crown Point Avenue. The route passes past an oil refinery before forming {{the border between}} West Deptford Township {{to the north and}} Westville to the south, where it begins to pass residences along {{the south side of the}} road. The road fully enters Westville before encountering the northern terminus of Route 45 at a Y-intersection. Past this intersection, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> of US 130 split briefly before rejoining.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan {{announced}} {{a plan to}} widen the Baltimore-Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, {{as part of a}} $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> As part of the proposal, the portion of the parkway owned by the National Park Service would be transferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} MD 200, {{which was to}} head east from I-370. At this time, the ramp from Shady Grove Road to westbound I-370 was shifted to a new alignment. In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> along I-370 were shifted to allow for construction of the MD 200 interchange. Construction on this segment of MD 200 was completed in February 2011, with the road opening to traffic on February 23.

5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before {{he had to get}} out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E
5|$|The four lane road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E

5|$|Through Yorktown, NY129 is a two-lane {{residential}} street alongside the reservoir, soon making a gradual bend {{to the southeast}} into an intersection with County Route131 (CR131; Underhill Avenue), a former alignment of NY131. At the junction with CR131, NY129 turns southward, soon winding its way southeast under <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> of the Taconic State Parkway, and back alongside the New Croton Reservoir. After crossing under the Taconic, the route then drops {{back down to the}} reservoir and passing a house reported to have been moved from Huntersville before it was flooded. Making several winds to the southeast, NY129 connects to the Gate House Bridge, soon running eastward through Yorktown. NY129 intersects with NY118 (Saw Mill River Road).

On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the other garrisoned buildings on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain defile.|$|E
5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank.

5|$|The Diocese {{established}} an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton {{and the rest}} of Sussex in Black Lion Street in <b>The</b> <b>Lanes</b> (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842. This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. More space was soon needed, so in 1854 it found a site {{on the west side of}} Ditchling Road on which to build a larger college. Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north–south routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook Parkway, {{designated}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork from the Bronx River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River {{in the city of}} Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the Sprain Brook crosses an interchange with NY100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. Bending to the north through Yonkers, the Sprain Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around the Grassy Sprain Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross Sprain Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> of the Sprain Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the Sprain Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club.|$|E
5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E
