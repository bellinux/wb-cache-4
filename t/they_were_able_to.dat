5|$|A team of {{scientists}} from Oxford University, the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute conducted tests on ten untrained Tanimbar corellas (Cacatua goffini), and found that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> solve complex mechanical puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Eloe Fanouche of RAM {{focussed}} {{on another}} aspect:Unlike many groups <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> capture the ethereal {{quality of their}} recorded sound on stage... On being asked how live gigs compared to studio work, they all declared that the straight atmosphere of the studio was too clinical.|$|E
5|$|James Palermo, {{artistic and}} general {{director}} of the Grant Park Music Festival felt that the musicians were able to interact more effectively with the new sound system because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hear each other better.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{break down}} polymers, lysosomes {{are capable of}} fusing with other organelles & digesting large structures or cellular debris; through cooperation with phagosomes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conduct autophagy, clearing out damaged structures. Similarly, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> break-down virus particles or bacteria in phagocytosis of macrophages.|$|R
6000|$|And again, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> absolve {{and make}} a human {{creature}} free and [...] loose from all his sins, if in case he repenteth and believeth in [...] Christ; and on the contrary, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detain all his sina, if [...] he doth not repent and believeth not in Christ.|$|R

5|$|William Tinsley Keeton (1933–1980) studied homing pigeons, {{showing that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{navigate}} using the earth's magnetic field, the sun, {{as well as}} both olfactory and visual cues.|$|E
5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, {{to create a new}} system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> markedly alter the power structure.|$|E

50|$|Together with Betaproteobacteria such as Thiomonas intermedia, Halothiobacillus species play an {{important}} role in global carbon and sulfur cycles. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> depend entirely on inorganic compounds (CO2 and reduced sulfur) for their carbon and energy needs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> promote corrosion of concrete, acidification of mine tailings, and bioleaching of low-grade ores.|$|R
5|$|Although Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, {{although}} Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 24 April, B Company had fought off seven assaults before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the {{remainder}} of their battalion on {{what became known as}} Gloster Hill. By this time the battalion was vastly outnumbered, low on ammunition and cut off from United Nations lines. Large himself was shot in the left shoulder and, along with most of the remaining Glosters, was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has found}} that manatee vibrissae are so {{sensitive}} that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perform active touch discrimination of textures. Manatees also use their vibrissae to navigate the turbid waterways of their environment. Research has indicated that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use these vibrissae to detect hydrodynamic stimuli {{in the same way}} that fish use their lateral line system.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} part, the Mercedes drivers set only one run of timed laps as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> save their tyres for the race, well {{clear of the}} competition. Lewis Hamilton was fastest, half a second ahead of Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel between the two. Romain Grosjean was {{eliminated}} after a spin at turn six. He was joined on the sidelines by both Saubers, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Sergio Pérez.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, {{mostly from the}} threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E

5|$|Middlesbrough {{accepted}} an undisclosed offer for Mido from an unnamed club on 26 July, and he completed a season-long move to former club Zamalek on 3 August, {{who had an}} option to sign him permanently if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> meet Middlesbrough's terms. On 20 August, Mido made a disappointing debut for Zamalek, wasting a second-half penalty as Zamalek threw away their lead to suffer a late 2–1 home victory to Petrojet in the Egyptian Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{soon learned}} that no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the {{following}} spring, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut {{at the end of}} October.

5|$|Santoso married again, {{this time}} to Indonesian Socialist Party figure Soebadio Sastrosatomo, on 10 January 1964. The couple were often {{separated}} when Sastrasatomo was imprisoned for his political activities, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> go on the hajj together. During the 1960s Santoso continued to be politically active, serving in the State Secretariat from 1962 to 1967 and on the State Advisory Council from 1967 to 1972. While with Sastrosatomo, she adopted a child.|$|E

5|$|Sucker Punch made {{suggested}} improvements {{they would}} like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad. Second Sons designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into Second Sons gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad).|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{wasted no}} time {{exploiting}} the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons. By signing the treaty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover Thessalonika {{and much of the}} Peloponnese. The Ottoman civil war ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, {{with the support of the}} Byzantine Empire, defeated his opponents.|$|E
5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish.

5000|$|Epona Pagoda Tree, a thin-looking, green tree from Epona with large, {{disk-shaped}} leaves surrounding it. The {{reason why}} the leaves are so huge <b>is</b> because <b>they</b> need {{to get as much}} carbon dioxide as possible. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do a remarkable ability of movement. If a herbivore comes to nibble on them, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fold back their branches.|$|R
