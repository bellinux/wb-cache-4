Being a fan of Pink Floyd and the Beatles, {{and especially}} the experimental concept albums both bands produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Adams wanted the programme to have the feel of a [...] "rock album...to convey <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> actually were on a spaceship or an alien planet — that sense of a huge aural landscape".|$|E

The writers created Ruby to change the perception of demons into more of a , rather than the [...] "black and white", [...] "They're evil, we're good" [...] approach previously used in the series. However, the writers also planned for Ruby to impact the brothers negatively by facilitating the story arc of Sam falling into evilwhich had been set up in the second season, but without follow-throughand causing a fracture in their relationship. Knowing this, the writers were amused by fans questioning why they were [...] "trying to make [...] likable". Despite Ruby's overall betrayal of the brothers, writer Sera Gamble commented, [...] " [...] brought <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't just dismiss demons as {{things that need to be}} killed right away. They could be useful, and while fundamentally untrustworthy, there might be cause to trust them in a given situation." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform it into something different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to have empathy for your partner.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E

I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|Given the Democratic {{resistance}} {{coupled with}} Holsinger's lack {{of response to}} the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied. The political scientist Norman Ornstein said, [...] "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or believe you {{are not likely to}} be confirmed, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling."

2500|$|In this scheme, any t out of n shares {{may be used}} {{to recover}} the secret.

2500|$|Cruyff had {{remained}} a highly controversial figure throughout his life. Cruyff’s relationships with Ajax, Barça, and KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association) were turbulent for some time, especially {{in his later}} years. Also, in his native Netherlands, there has been always a love-hate relationship between Cruyff and his fellow countrymen. There was a long-standing feud between Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, though never confirmed publicly by both sides. He also often criticised José Mourinho for his defensive-based coaching philosophy, stated, “José Mourinho is a negative coach. He only cares about the result and doesn't care much for good football.” As David Winner notes, “Cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years.” He {{has been accused of}} being arrogant, greedy, intolerant, despotic, “too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising.” And Winner concludes that, “With his belief in the “conflict model” – <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> got the best out of people by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline – Cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight. Battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures, especially at Ajax and Barcelona, the two clubs that defined his career.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Still {{determined}} to get the album out, Swervedriver forwent signing with one of two other interested major labels and instead opted for independent label Zero Hour Records out of New York. They officially released 99th Dream, their fourth album, on 24 February 1998. The band also formed their own label, Sonic Wave Discs (SWD), and on 10 August 1998 issued the album in the UK. About the album's progression to a more indie rock style, Franklin told The Star-Ledger, [...] "It wasn't a conscious decision. [...] {{just the way it}} was going – concise little pop songs, bossa nova beats and such." [...] He continued, [...] "I've always liked <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't always know where it's coming from... all about time. It's all over the place. I didn't put too much thought into it, which may be good. You're fueling more from the subconscious that way." [...] In an interview for Mean Street magazine, Hindmarsh mentioned, [...] "There's a track called 'She Weaves a Tender Trap.' That's like a one-take, all-four-of-us thing, and it has a lot more air in it, a lot more space. Whereas in the past, we used to try and fill every single hole. That song sort of defines a change in the way we're thinking. I think we're headed that way, to leave space to let the music breathe a little bit." ...|$|E
