40|$|Some {{issues of}} {{realization}} of <b>thermocontact</b> problems with account of factional heating {{by means of}} finite-element method are considered. The examples of a solution of stationary and non-stationary axially symmetric problems with sliding of contact surfaces {{at the expense of}} a difference of angular velocities are presented. The essential influence of factional heating on the distribution of contact pressure and temperature fields in structures is show...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} some available {{experimental results}} on the friction behavior along the contact interface. Then an improved general friction equation is formulated based on the above experimental results and applied with a stick-slip algorithm. It {{is a function of}} the slip velocity (including velocity hardening or weakening), the slip state, the temperature, the normal contact force and the material properties. This has been implemented to our finite element code, which applied the node-to-point contact element strategy to handle the friction contact (even the <b>thermocontact)</b> between multiple finite-deformation bodies with stick and finite frictional slip. Several practical examples are also presented to show its usefulness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} a rigid punch {{contacting}} with a finite graded layer on a rigid substrate is investigated {{within the framework of}} steady-state plane strain thermoelasticity, in which heat generated by contact friction is considered with a constant friction coefficient and inertia effects are neglected. The material properties of the graded layer vary according to an exponential function in the thickness direction. Fourier integral transform method and transform matrix approach are employed to reduce the current <b>thermocontact</b> problem to the second kind of Cauchy-type singular integral equation. Distributions of the contact pressure and the in-plane stress under the prescribed thermoelastic environment with different parameter combinations, including ratio of shear moduli, relative sliding speed, friction coefficient and thermal parameters are obtained and analyzed, as well as the stress singularity and the stress intensity factors near the contact edges. The results should be helpful for the design of surfaces with strong wear resistance and novel graded materials for real applications...|$|E
40|$|Freely {{suspended}} smectic {{films of}} sub-micrometer thickness and lateral extensions of several millimeters {{are used to}} study thermally driven convection and diffusion in the film plane. The experiments were performed during a six minute microgravity phase of a TEXUS suborbital rocket flight (Texus 52, launched April 27, 2015). The project served as a preliminary test for a planned ISS Experiment with liquid crystal films (OASIS), and in addition it provided new experimental data on smectic films exposed to in-plane thermal gradients. We find an attraction of the smectic material towards the cold {{edge of the film}} in a temperature gradient, similar to a Soret effect. This process is reversed when this edge is heated up again. Thermal convection driven by two <b>thermocontacts</b> in the film is practically absent, even at temperature gradients up to 10 Kmm, thermally driven convection sets in when the hot post reaches the transition temperature to the nematic phase. An additional experiment was performed under microgravity conditions to test the stability of liquid crystal bridges in different smectic phases...|$|R
