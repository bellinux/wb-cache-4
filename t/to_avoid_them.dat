5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b> Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Their {{colouration}} is variable; black {{combined with}} red and yellow is a common pattern, and many species have golden-coloured pubescence (hair). Many other species are brightly coloured, which warns predators <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b> The formicine ant Camponotus bendigensis is similar in appearance to M. fulvipes, and data suggest C. bengdigensis is a batesian mimic of M. fulvipes. The number of malpighian tubules differs between castes; in M. dispar, males have 16 tubules, queens range from 23 to 26, and workers have 21 to 29.|$|E

5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline over them, and then burn them alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that {{the safety of the}} POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Frank {{began to}} find that Judy was more {{aggressive}} towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them,</b> on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E

5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (President would be scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them</b> if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b> Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them,</b> or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|E

5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de León is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b> In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E

25|$|Female Eufriesea have fierce stings, so predators {{will want}} <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>them.</b> Among the Eufriesea genus, females have evolved Müllerian mimetic complexes, making it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the species in the surinamensis group. Male Ef. surinamensis are stingless, but are Batesian automimics as their yellow hindtibial fringes trick other animals into believing they are stinging females and not stingless males. There are also flies that mimic Eufriesea, including asilids. Mimicking Eufriesea may provide these flies protection from their predators.|$|E
