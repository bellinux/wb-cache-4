40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the idea of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> arid its {{assimilation}} into architecture through philosophy and mathematics. In all its iterations, <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> appears as two constitutive items: <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> as self-similarity, which implies recursion; <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> within <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> and in turn, <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> as continuous discontinuity. The persistence of this conception of die fold will be demonstrated through a discussion of Leibniz's Monadology, Deleuze's Le Pli, and some mathematical ideas from catastrophe and chaos theory. This raises the issue of continuity between disciplines and thus the philosophical status this confers on <b>the</b> <b>fold...</b>|$|R

5|$|Snakes, {{like other}} reptiles, have a skin {{covered in a}} scale. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects {{the body of the}} snake, aids it in locomotion, allows {{moisture}} to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture (such as Acrochordus). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators.|$|E
5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites may {{go back to the}} Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. <b>The</b> <b>folded</b> wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite the government having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E

40|$|Molecular chaperones {{are known}} to be {{essential}} for avoiding protein aggregation in vivo, but it is still unclear how they affect protein folding mechanisms. We use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to follow <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of a protein inside the GroEL/GroES chaperonin cavity over a time range from milliseconds to hours. Our results show that confinement in the chaperonin decelerates <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of <b>the</b> C-terminal domain in the substrate protein rhodanese, but leaves <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rate of <b>the</b> N-terminal domain unaffected. Microfluidic mixing experiments indicate that strong interactions of the substrate with the cavity walls impede <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process, but <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> hierarchy is preserved. Our results imply that no universal chaperonin mechanism exists. Rather, a competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions determines <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rates and mechanisms of a substrate inside the GroEL/GroES cage...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>folding</b> of {{ribonuclease}} A (RNase A) {{has been}} extensively studied by characterizing the disulfide containing intermediates using different experimental conditions and analytical techniques. So far, some aspects still remain unclear such as {{the role of the}} loop 65 - 72 in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway. We have studied <b>the</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> of a RNase A derivative containing at position 67 the substitution Asn [...] > isoAsp where the local structure of the loop 65 - 72 has been modified keeping intact the C 65 -C 72 disulfide bond. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> behavior of this mutant to that of the wild-type protein, we found that the deamidation significantly decreases <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rate and alters <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway of RNase A. Results presented here shed light {{on the role of the}} 65 - 72 region in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process of RNase A and also clarifies the effect of the deamidation on the folding/unfolding processes. On a more general ground, this study represents the first characterization of the intermediates produced along <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of a deamidated protein...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>folded</b> dipole is {{therefore}} well matched to 300nbsp&ohm balanced transmission lines, such as twin-feed ribbon cable. <b>The</b> <b>folded</b> dipole has a wider bandwidth {{than a single}} dipole.

25|$|Advances in {{experimental}} and theoretical {{studies have shown}} that folding can be viewed in terms of energy landscapes, where folding kinetics is considered as a progressive organisation of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which a protein passes on its way to <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> structure. This has been described in terms of a folding funnel, in which an unfolded protein has a large number of conformational states available and there are fewer states available to <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> protein. A funnel implies that for protein folding there is a decrease in energy and loss of entropy with increasing tertiary structure formation. The local roughness of the funnel reflects kinetic traps, corresponding to the accumulation of misfolded intermediates. A folding chain progresses toward lower intra-chain free-energies by increasing its compactness. The chain's conformational options become increasingly narrowed ultimately toward one native structure.|$|E

40|$|Fold uplifts compete {{during their}} {{development}} with regional subsidence in the frontal parts of thrust belts and accretionary wedges. Two cases exist in frontal thrust belts. In the first, more common case, the uplift rate of <b>the</b> external <b>folds</b> {{is higher than}} the subsidence rate of the foredeep. In the second case <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift is less than the regional subsidence. <b>The</b> total <b>fold</b> uplift may be considered as <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift rate minus the regional subsidence rate; this value can be either positive or negative. Positive total fold uplift occurs when folds rise faster than regional subsidence and the envelope of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest rises towards the hinterland of the accretionary wedge. In the opposite case, negative total <b>fold</b> uplift, <b>the</b> envelope dips towards <b>the</b> hinterland because <b>folds</b> rise more slowly than regional subsidence. In the first positive case, <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> are deeply eroded and the onlap of the growing strata moves away from <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest if <b>the</b> sedimentation rate is lower than <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift rate in marine or alluvial environments. In the second negative case, where folds rise at lower rates than the regional subsidence, the onlap moves towards <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> crest if <b>the</b> sedimentation rate is higher than <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> uplift rate. This is also the more favorable case for hydrocarbon traps where growth strata can seal <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> Moreover <b>the</b> fast subsidence rates in the foredeep provide a higher thermal maturation. This second tectonic setting is commonly associated with accretionary wedges forming along west-directed subduction zones, which are characterized by high subsidence rates in the foredeep or trench, due to the fast 'eastward' roll-back of the subduction hinge (e. g. Apennines, Carpathians,Banda are) ...|$|R
40|$|The caecum of the ostrich was {{observed}} {{to contain a}} fold that spiralled approximately 30 times, transforming the lumen into a long, spiral-shaped cavity. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> consisted of mucosa, muscularis mucosa and submucosa.
