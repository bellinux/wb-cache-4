The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
25|$|The takahē is monogamous, with pairs {{remaining}} {{together from}} 12 years <b>to,</b> <b>probably,</b> their entire lives. It builds a bulky nest under bushes and scrub, and lays {{one to three}} buff eggs. The chick survival rate is 73-97%. Recently, human intervention has been required to maintain the breeding success of the takahē, which is relatively low in the wild compared to other, less threatened species, so methods such as the removal of infertile eggs from nests and the captive rearing of chicks have been introduced to manage the takahē population. The Fiordland takahē population has a successful degree of reproductive output due to these management methods: the number of chicks per pairing with infertile egg removal and captive rearing is 0.66, compared to 0.43 for regions without any breeding management.|$|E

Of these, El Mirador, Tikal, Nakbé, Tintal, Xulnal and Wakná {{are the largest}} in the Maya world, Such size was manifested not only in the extent of the site, but also in the volume or monumentality, especially in the construction of immense platforms to support large temples.

Hansen's dating has been called into question by many other Maya archaeologists, and developments leading <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> extra-regional power by the Late Preclassic of Kaminaljuyu, in the Southern Maya Area, suggest that Maya civilization developed in different ways in the Lowlands and the SMA to produce what we know as the Classic Maya.|$|E
25|$|Some {{officers}} of the Irish Brigade {{are believed to have}} cried out Cuimhnígí ar Luimneach agus ar fheall na Sasanach! ("Remember Limerick and Saxon perfidy") at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745. Modern research by Eoghan Ó hAnnracháin claims that it is very doubtful if the regiments would also have been chanting in Irish, a language unknown <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> a majority of the brigade at the time. Others strongly dispute this, as over the course of 100 years new recruits were brought into the brigade mostly from the Irish-speaking regions of West Munster, the homeland of, among other the O'Connell family. Stephen McGarry also makes the point in his book Irish Brigades Abroad that Irish was widely spoken in the Irish regiments of France. Daniel Charles O'Connell was the uncle of The Liberator Daniel O'Connell and was the last Colonel of the French Irish Brigade in 1794 and rose to general rank. The O'Connells were native Irish speakers and members of dispossessed Gaelic Aristocracy. According to official French Army regulations, {{officers of}} the Irish Brigade regiments had to be Irish, half of whom had to be born in Ireland and the other half born of Irish descent in France. In practice by the outbreak of the French Revolution most serving {{officers of the}} Brigade fell into the second category.|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 1907, Connecticut ran onto a reef while {{entering}} the harbor at Culebra Island. The Navy did not release {{any information about}} the grounding until press dispatches from San Juan carrying news of the incident reached the mainland on 23 January.

The Navy amended this the next day, releasing a statement that Connecticut had been only slightly damaged and had returned to her shakedown cruise. However, damage to the ship was much more serious than the Navy admitted; in contrast to an official statement saying that Connecticut had only [...] "touched" [...] the rocks, she actually had run full upon the reef when traversing [...] "a course well marked with buoys" [...] in [...] "broad daylight" [...] and did enough damage <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> require a dry docking.

500|$|A 2016 {{study from}} Lund University and the GSI {{nevertheless}} cast some {{doubt on the}} syntheses of moscovium and tennessine after the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized these elements as having been discovered in 2009–2010. It found that the decay chains assigned to the isotopes 287Mc and 288Mc were probably internally consistent, with the uncertainty due to the probable insensitivity of the measurements to very short and very long nuclide lifetimes, incorrect assignments of other decay chains from the 243Am+48Ca reaction to different moscovium isotopes, or uncertainty {{in the identification of}} some of the daughters of these moscovium isotopes. On the other hand, the decay chains assigned to 289Mc, the isotope instrumental in the official confirmation of the synthesis of moscovium and tennessine, were found not to be internally consistent. Some subsets of these chains were found to be consistent, suggesting however that their true assignment was to 288Mc, and that their shortness indicated instead new spontaneous fission branches in its daughters 284Nh and 280Rg – or, more likely, undetected electron capture branches in these daughters leading to the even–even nuclides 284Cn and 280Ds, which have a very low barrier to spontaneous fission. While the 294Ts decay chains were found to be congruent, the 293Ts decay chains approved by the JWP were found <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> not be so and require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different tennessine isotopes. It was also found that the set of chains from 293Ts and 289Mc were not congruent. The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticised the IUPAC/IUPAP JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine was an almost certainly non-existent link was [...] "problematic".|$|E

2500|$|In {{looking at}} the {{creation}} of Native Authorities at Oke-Imo, Ilesa in 1900 by Major Reeve Tucker [...] and the re-organization of North East District in December, 1912; [...] the separation of Ijesa, Ekiti and other areas on 1 January 1913 {{and the creation of}} Ekiti Native Authority [...] with its headquarters at Ado-Ekiti; it is obvious that conflicts and agitations for local autonomy had pervaded politics of traditional institutions in Ekitiland. When the British moved its administrative centre for Ekiti District to Ado-Ekiti in 1913 where the Ewi holds sway, [...] the change in political status of Ado-Ekiti spurred a desire in other traditional authorities across Ekitiland to further demand for local autonomies. The heightened struggle did not give credibility to the fact that Ado-Ekiti which was eventually picked was already the official and major administrative capital of Ekitiland since 1 January 1913, [...] nor did it occur to the agitators that it had over time become a second home for all Ekiti people irrespective of their hometown of place of origin.

2500|$|In {{at least}} one case, Chang Wang, the {{president}} of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an [...] "excess of genetic material in her blood" [...] and advised her to see her doctor in order [...] "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [...] going to have a developmental problem and is going <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> cease to exist right after the birth." [...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Since that date, more remains, {{including}} skulls, {{have been}} found that have been referred to Chasmosaurus, and several additional species have been named within the genus. Today {{some of these are}} considered to only reflect a morphological variation among the known sample of Chasmosaurus belli skulls; others are seen as valid species of Chasmosaurus or as separate genera. In 1933 Barnum Brown named Chasmosaurus kaiseni, honouring Peter Kaisen and based on skull AMNH 5401, differing from C. belli in having very long brow horns. This form is perhaps related to Chasmosaurus canadensis ('from Canada') named by Thomas M. Lehman in 1990. The latter species, originally Monoclonius canadensis Lambe 1902, had been described as Eoceratops canadensis by Lambe in 1915. Eoceratops and the long-horned Chasmosaurus kaiseni were thought <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> be exemplars of Mojoceratops by Nicholas Longrich, although different teams of researches have found Mojoceratops to be a synonym of Chasmosaurus russelli. Campbell and colleagues, in their 2016 analysis of Chasmosaurus specimens found Eoceratops and C. kaiseni to be referable to Chasmosaurus sp. {{due to the lack of}} the parietal preserved in the holotypes of both. Richard Swann Lull in 1933 named an unusual, short-muzzled skull, specimen ROM 839 (earlier ROM 5436) collected in 1926, as Chasmosaurus brevirostris, [...] "with a short snout". This has been seen as a junior synonym of C. belli. Charles Mortram Sternberg added Chasmosaurus russelli in 1940, based on specimen NMC 8800 from southwestern Alberta (lower Dinosaur Park Formation). The specific name honours Loris Shano Russell. Thomas Lehman described Chasmosaurus mariscalensis in 1989 from Texas, which has now been renamed Agujaceratops. The most recently described species is Chasmosaurus irvinensis named in 2001, which stems from the uppermost beds of the Dinosaur Park Formation. This species was given its own genus, Vagaceratops, in 2010.|$|E

But these masters of the craft I was 'prentice <b>to</b> <b>probably</b> could not have said anything that I should not have found wise and well, and I am sure now I should have been the loser if the talk had shunned any of the phases of human nature which it touched. It is best to find that all men are of the same make, and that there are certain universal things which interest them as much as the supernal things, and amuse them even more. There was a saying of Lowell's which he was fond of repeating at the menace of any form of the transcendental, and he liked to warn himself and others with his homely, [...] "Remember the dinner-bell." [...] What I recall of the whole effect of a time so happy for me is that in all that was said, however high, however fine, we were never out of hearing of the dinner-bell; and perhaps this is the best effect I can leave with the reader. It was the first dinner served in courses that I had sat down to, and I felt that this service gave it a romantic importance which the older fashion of the West still wanted. Even at Governor Chase's table in Columbus the Governor carved; I knew of the dinner 'a la Russe', as it was then called, only from books; and it was a sort of literary flavor that I tasted in the successive dishes. When it came to the black coffee, and then to the 'petits verres' of cognac, with lumps of sugar set fire to atop, it was something that so far transcended my home-kept experience that it began to seem altogether visionary.|$|E
6000|$|Jocantha ordered {{some tea}} and a muffin, {{and then turned}} a {{friendly}} scrutiny on her neighbour {{with a view to}} catching her eye. At that precise moment the girl’s face lit up with sudden pleasure, her eyes sparkled, a flush came into her cheeks, and she looked almost pretty. A young man, whom she greeted with an affectionate “Hullo, Bertie,” came up to her table and took his seat in a chair facing her. Jocantha looked hard at the new-comer; he was in appearance a few years younger than herself, very much better looking than Gregory, rather better looking, in fact, than any of the young men of her set. She guessed him to be a well-mannered young clerk in some wholesale warehouse, existing and amusing himself as best he might on a tiny salary, and commanding a holiday of about two weeks in the year. He was aware, of course, of his good looks, but with the shy self-consciousness of the Anglo-Saxon, not the blatant complacency of the Latin or Semite. He was obviously on terms of friendly intimacy with the girl he was talking <b>to,</b> <b>probably</b> they were drifting towards a formal engagement. Jocantha pictured the boy’s home, in a rather narrow circle, with a tiresome mother who always wanted to know how and where he spent his evenings. He would exchange that humdrum thraldom in due course for a home of his own, dominated by a chronic scarcity of pounds, shillings, and pence, and a dearth of most of the things that made life attractive or comfortable. Jocantha felt extremely sorry for him. She wondered if he had seen the “Yellow Peacock”; the odds were enormously in favour of the supposition that he had not. The girl had finished her tea and would shortly be going back to her work; when the boy was alone it would be quite easy for Jocantha to say: “My husband has made other arrangements for me this evening; would you care to make use of this ticket, which would otherwise be wasted?” Then she could come there again one afternoon for tea, and, if she saw him, ask him how he liked the play. If he was a nice boy and improved on acquaintance he could be given more theatre tickets, and perhaps asked to come one Sunday to tea at Chelsea. Jocantha made up her mind that he would improve on acquaintance, and that Gregory would like him, and that the Fairy Godmother business would prove far more entertaining than she had originally anticipated. The boy was distinctly presentable; he knew how to brush his hair, which was possibly an imitative faculty; he knew what colour of tie suited him, which might be intuition; he was exactly the type that Jocantha admired, which of course was accident. Altogether she was rather pleased when the girl looked at the clock and bade a friendly but hurried farewell to her companion. Bertie nodded “good-bye,” gulped down a mouthful of tea, and then produced from his overcoat pocket a paper-covered book, bearing the title “Sepoy and Sahib, a tale of the great Mutiny.” ...|$|E
