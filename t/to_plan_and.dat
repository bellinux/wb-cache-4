5|$|Explorer/Air Explorer/Sea Explorer : The Explorer badge {{is split}} into three {{different}} badges {{for the three}} different Scouting sections (Land Scouts, Air Scouts and Sea Scouts). The Explorer badge teaches the Scout {{to take control of}} situations, and requires the Scout <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> run larger activities: an orienteering wide game for the whole troop, an incident hike for their Patrol, a Patrol expedition, and a troop campfire.|$|E

5|$|Created {{following}} World War I, {{the corps}} was not activated for use {{until just before}} World War II almost 20 years later.

A Scout is required <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> run a wide game for their Patrol, a Patrol camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, and they need to assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Admiral Jellicoe was {{tasked with}} helping <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> {{coordinate}} the naval policies and defences of the British Dominions. New Zealand was {{made available for}} his transportation, and was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for the tour; the main changes were the removal of her flying-off platforms and the lower forward four-inch guns. The first stop was India, with New Zealand arriving in Bombay on 14 March 1919 and departing six weeks later. The battlecruiser arrived at Albany, Western Australia, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. New Zealand sailed via Melbourne and Hobart to depart from Sydney for New Zealand on 16 August.|$|E

5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation of how <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> execute a vacation in the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the Public Road Administration {{recommended}} a bridge solution. SBT {{changed its name}} to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge. On 26 June 1987, SBT decided to work towards permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. The board unanimously supported the triangular proposal on 16 September, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time <b>to</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{regional}} transit authority (RTA) was formed <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> construct a {{light rail system}} for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion plan to build light rail under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would {{be incorporated into the}} initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 1999. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement.|$|E
5|$|Its {{multiplayer}} {{features were}} praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote {{that it was one}} of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> coordinate strategy.|$|E

Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

5|$|The 75th Ranger Regiment (U.S. Army Rangers) is {{the premier}} light-infantry {{unit of the}} United States Army and is {{headquartered}} at Fort Benning, Georgia.

Each battalion can deploy {{anywhere in the world}} within 18 hours notice. The Army places much importance on the 75th Ranger Regiment and its training; it possesses the capabilities to conduct conventional and most special operations missions. Rangers are capable of infiltrating by land, sea, or air and direct action operations such as conducting raids or assaulting buildings or airfields.|$|E
5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered a breach of Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation to go ahead eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a critical time and demonstrated its ability <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E
5|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> strategize, {{much like}} {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen}} in the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the ability to plan subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an Action Language-Answer Set Program-ming based {{approach}} <b>to</b> solving <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling problems in hybrid do-mains- domains that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. We use action language H {{to represent the}} domain and then translate the resulting theory into an A-Prolog program. In this way, we reduce the problem of finding solutions <b>to</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling problems <b>to</b> computing answer sets of A-Prolog pro-grams. We cite a <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling example from the literature and show how to model it in H. We show how to translate the resulting H theory into an equivalent A-Prolog program. We compute the answer sets of the resulting pro-gram using a hybrid solver called EZCSP which loosely integrates a constraint solver with an answer set solver. The solver allows us reason about constraints over reals and compute solutions <b>to</b> complex <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling problems. Results have shown that our approach can be applied <b>to</b> any <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> schedul-ing problem in hybrid domains. ...|$|R
