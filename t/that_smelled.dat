500|$|In a 2012 interview, Katamsi {{admitted}} {{the film was}} in part overacted {{and that it had}} been a potent way to spread and indoctrinate viewers in the New Order's ideology. The Tempo survey suggested that it was effective propaganda, leading viewers to [...] "reject all <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> of the PKI and communism". Although it is no longer broadcast on 30 September, the film remains available. A video CD edition was released by Virgo in 2001 and the G30S/PKI museum at Lubang Buaya offers regular screenings in an on-site cinema. Both a 35mm and VHS copy are stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.|$|E
2500|$|In the novel's {{account of}} the civil war and {{subsequent}} peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of García Márquez's earlier works, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba. In the novel's final chapter, García Márquez refers to the novel Hopscotch (Spanish: Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar in the following line: [...] "...in the room <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die" [...] (p.412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in Hopscotch who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: The Death of Artemio Cruz (Spanish: La Muerte de Artemio Cruz) by Carlos Fuentes and Explosion in a Cathedral (Spanish: El siglo de las luces) by Alejo Carpentier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Buechner's time in Bermuda has, however, {{manifested}} {{in other respects}} in his writing and in his life. [...] While he often refers to {{the natural beauty of}} Bermuda's island landscape—the [...] "unutterable, blinding blue-green flash of the ocean" [...] and its [...] "unkempt greenness"—and its idyllic island charms—the [...] "narrow-gauge Toonerville Trolley of a railway with wicker armchairs for seats" [...] and the pastel houses [...] "with their blinding white roofs stepped to catch the rain"—the distinctly British flavor of pre-World War II Bermuda also instilled in him an enduring love of English custom and culture. [...] Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of [...] "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them." [...] Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him: [...] "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> the way a new book printed in England does when you first open it." [...] That smell, [...] "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," [...] stayed with Buechner the rest of his life. Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates [...] "helped drag brushwood {{to the top of a}} hill for a bonfire" [...] and went around [...] "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda"—appear throughout his memoirs. [...] Thus, in The Eyes of the Heart, Buechner recalls the [...] "royal governor who on state occasions such as the coronation of George VI wore a cocked hat with white plumes on it like the captain of the Pinafore." ...|$|E
