50|$|Proponents of {{unrestricted}} {{file sharing}} point out how file sharing has given people broader and faster access to media, has increased exposure to new artists, and {{has reduced the}} costs of <b>transferring</b> <b>media</b> (including less environmental damage).

The augers can range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter for full scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.|$|E

50|$|The reactor had {{vertical}} fuel channels, was cooled by {{an organic}} liquid (an oil) rather than water. The neutrons were moderated by cool heavy {{water in a}} large calandria vessel surrounding the fuel channels. The reactor did not use conventional control rods, but relied on control {{of the level of}} the heavy water moderator to adjust the power output. The reactor could be shut down quickly (SCRAM) by rapid dumping of the moderator. The organic liquid, called OS-84, that was selected as a coolant in WR-1 is a mixture of terphenyls treated catalytically with hydrogen to produce 40 percent saturated hydrocarbons. The terphenyls are petrochemical derivatives that were readily available and were already in use as heat <b>transfer</b> <b>media.</b> Using an organic coolant meant the reactor was run at low operating pressures, and had very low corrosion rates. The low corrosion rates allowed it to use metallic uranium and uranium carbide fuels, which corrode in water. The metallic fuel conducts heat better, so that a higher power core could be used in the same space.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} {{increase}} the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), adherence compounds such as hyaluronic acid and fibrin sealant have been introduced into subfertility management. Adherence compounds {{are added to the}} embryo transfer medium in {{order to increase}} the likelihood of embryo implantation, with the potential for higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether embryo <b>transfer</b> <b>media</b> containing adherence compounds affect the live birth rate in ART compared to <b>transfer</b> <b>media</b> without adherence compounds. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (to 26 th May 2009) for publications which described randomised controlled trials of the addition of adherence compounds to embryo <b>transfer</b> <b>media.</b> Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked and conference abstracts handsearched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo <b>transfer</b> <b>media</b> containing adherence compounds with <b>transfer</b> <b>media</b> without (or with lower doses of) adherence compounds were included. The adherence compounds that were evaluated were hyaluronic acid and fibrin sealant. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author selected the trials for inclusion according to the above criteria, after which two authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies with a total of 3698 participants were analysed. One studied fibrin sealant, the other 15 studied hyaluronic acid. There was no evidence of a treatment effect of fibrin sealant as an adherence compound. For hyaluronic acid, {{there was no evidence of}} a treatment effect on live birth rate. Evidence of treatment effects could be found for the clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1. 41, 95 % CI 1. 22 to 1. 63; P < 0. 00001) and the multiple pregnancy rate (OR 1. 86, 95 % CI 1. 49 to 2. 31; P < 0. 00001), with higher rates in the hyaluronic acid groups. No evidence of treatment effect was found for the other outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of an improved clinical pregnancy rate with the use of adherence compounds in ART cycles but no evidence of an effect on live birth rate. The increase in multiple pregnancy rate may be the result of the use of a combination of an adherence compound and a policy of transferring more than one embryo. Further studies of adherence compounds with single embryo transfer need to be undertake...|$|E
