At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E

25|$|A {{critical}} part of the initiation of any sort of collective identity for African-born slaves began with relationships formed on slave ships crossing the middle passage. Shipmates called each other malungos, and this relationship was considered as important and valuable as the relationship with their wives and children.

25|$|Mutual aid {{is often}} erroneously {{understood}} as simply {{the exchange of}} support. Mutual aid is better conceptualized as multidimensional with at least 10 types of processes or activities that occur amongst and between members, including: sharing data, the dialectic process, discussion of taboo topics, the all in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> phenomenon, developing a universal perspective, mutual support, mutual demand (including confrontation), rehearsal of new skills, individual problem solving, and the strengths in numbers phenomenon (Gitterman, 2004; Shulman, 2006; Steinberg, 2004).|$|E

25|$|Despite the regiment's {{exploits}} at Ferozeshah and Sobaron {{being among}} the regiment's proudest honours, the tour in India was also the sight of one its greatest embarrassments. On two separate occasions, the regiment lost its colors. At first, they were lost when the boat carrying them sank in the Ganges in 1842. The second time, after they were recovered, they burned when <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> caught fire in 1847. The regiment remained in India for another two years. In that time, the regiment was garrisoned at various stations in India, in addition to performing ceremonial duties for visiting dignitaries. The regiment returned to England in 1847 before being sent to Ireland in 1854.|$|E
25|$|The Danubian Cossacks {{were fully}} pardoned for their past, {{and managed to}} win over the Tsar's trust, which was {{confirmed}} when the Russian Army Crossed the Danube, as Nicholas was in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> that Hladky had initially came over in, with Kosh Polkovnyks rowing. The Tsar let the Danubians form a new Special Zaporozhian Host (Отдельное Запорожное Войско), with Hladky as the appointed Ataman.

Despite the small number of men, they soon became a prized asset due to their knowledge of the complicated Danube Delta. They proved themselves in combat in the storming of Isaccea, and 10 Cossacks were awarded the Cross of St. George.|$|E
2500|$|Remarkable as this was, {{even the}} run of Hassalo was not the fastest through the Cascades. [...] On June 3, 1881, captain Troup had taken R.R.

Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was angry because all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E
25|$|Maiorica {{initially}} {{stopped in}} Goa, then arrived in Macau {{with the intention}} to proselytize in Japan. However, by 1619, Japan had begun persecuting Christians, so he went instead to Makassar and remained there for a year. Afterwards, he returned to Macau and traveled to Fai-Fo (present-day Hội An) in 1624 in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> as Alexandre de Rhodes, João Cabral, {{and two or three}} other Jesuits. Whereas de Rhodes studied Vietnamese under Francisco de Pina (1585–1625), Maiorica studied Vietnamese at the Jesuit residence in Nước Mặn (today An Nhơn District, Bình Định Province). He proselytized in Đàng Trong (Cochinchina) from 1628, when his superiors sent him back to Macau en route to a new assignment in Japan. He was again unable to make the journey, this time due to poor weather. In 1630, he traveled to Champa, where he was quickly imprisoned. After a Portuguese merchant ransomed him, Maiorica made his way to Cửa Hàn (Danang) via Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921. In his opening first-class game, Hobbs played {{for a team}} selected by businessman Lionel Robinson against the Australian touring team, which had travelled to England on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> as the returning MCC team. After scoring 85, he tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia and missed {{the remainder of the}} match. The injury forced Hobbs to miss the opening two Tests against Australia, but once recovered, he immediately scored 172 against Yorkshire; with England already trailing 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose him for the third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, Hobbs suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. However, the pain forced him to leave the field on the first day and after a day of rest, it worsened. A prominent surgeon, Sir Berkley Moynihan, was based in Leeds and Hobbs consulted him over the pain. Moynihan diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day; in the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. Hobbs missed the rest of the season, and upon recovering from surgery took a family holiday.|$|E
50|$|Once the Armistice {{was signed}} in 1918, many yachtsmen wasted little time in getting afloat again and as early as April 1919 Frank Cowper, {{who was then the}} Cruising Association's Local Representative at Fowey {{reported}} that many small boats were fitting out, some already being in the water. They would have found that, superficially, there had been little change during the previous five years. A few familiar landmarks had disappeared: at the mouth of some rivers with shifting bars any buoyage that still existed might bear little relation to the channel, but <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boats</b> were back afloat and, as before the war, it was regarded as bad form to display the boat's name anywhere except on the jerseys and caps of the crew.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} Tongji University {{can be traced}} back to 1907 when the German Medical School for the Chinese in Shanghai was founded by the German {{government}} together with the German physicians Erich Paulun, Oscar von Schab and Paul Krieg. The school was affiliated with the Tongji-Hospital the German physicians had established in Shanghai on the initiative of Paulun. The name Tongji suggests cooperating by riding <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat.</b> The school was expanded to include engineering in its programs and got its new name as German Medical and Engineering School for the Chinese in Shanghai in 1912. It was formally established as a Chinese university under the name of Tongji University in 1923/1924 and was renamed as National Tongji University in 1927. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), the university campus was moved from Shanghai first to Zhejiang Province, then to Jiangxi Province and Yunnan Province and later to Sichuan Province. It was eventually moved back to Shanghai in 1946. It then grew to be a comprehensive university which offered programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, and law. Following a nationwide campaign of reorganizing schools and departments between universities in 1952, Tongji University became a university knowns for its civil engineering and architecture programs. Tongji is also the first university that introduced Urban Planning into China. In 1952, the first twelve full professors of Tongji are: 李国豪(Li Guohao), 周念先(Zhou Nianxian), 钱仲毅(Qian Zhongyi), 陈超(Chen Chao), 周方白 (周圭), 李寿康, et al.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of {{the start of the}} race was moved to approximately [...] upstream of Putney Bridge in order to reduce interruptions to the race from steamers. [...] Indeed, both boat club presidents had issued a caution to the steamer captains, indicating that the race would be conducted on the ebb tide should any interruption take place which would risk the steamers becoming grounded at Mortlake. The finish was moved the corresponding distance upstream to maintain the traditional length of the race. Oxford rowed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> as the previous race, which was constructed by J. and S. Salter while Cambridge utilised a new vessel built for them by Taylor of Newcastle. [...] Oxford were coached by George Morrison who had rowed in the 1859, 1860 and 1861 races and was non-rowing president for the 1862 race. The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in the March and December races) and the 1852 race, while the starter was Edward Searle.|$|E

[...] It was the first Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race. [...] The Light Blues would row in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>boat</b> in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races, while Oxford's craft was manufactured by Swiss firm Stämpfli Racing Boats. [...] Both boats were German-rigged, where the number four and five row on the bow side. [...] The inclement weather continued until the day of the race, with further disruption predicted and the threat of postponement a real one.
