40|$|The rise {{of imperialism}} has {{given birth to}} the notion of {{globalization}} that connotes several ideas: First, threat to national boundaries; second, rapid technological progresses; and third, the policy of homogenization or uniformity. <b>Technological</b> <b>progresses</b> have been regarded as the main threat on national identity and the main cause of global identity. The discursive reflection of globalization can be studied in literature and best in poetry. Because the local aspect of English poetry places more emphasis on the significance of poetry {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th century, “The Horses” by the Scottish Edwin Muir (1887 - 1959) can be an excellent study of the poet’s local attitude towards globalization. Although Muir wrote in English, he never lost sense of regionality and national identity. He was always concerned about feeling in one language and thinking in another. This study is an attempt to show Muir’s view, as a localized figure, about globalization and the aftermath of <b>technological</b> <b>progresses</b> with a brief look at “The Horses” offering possibility of nationalism.

5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> is an engine for conquest.

Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, <b>technological</b> <b>progress,</b> and conquest.|$|E

5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E

For the importance in mind, several researchers have attempted textual-data mining from patent documents.

We complement a probabilistic approach by adopting linguistic clues and propose an unsupervised procedure to discover technological trends. Based on the experiment, our method is promising not only in its accuracy, 77 % in R-precision, but also in its functionality and novelty of discovering meaningful technological trends...|$|R
5|$|Iron {{shows the}} {{characteristic}} chemical {{properties of the}} transition metals, namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, ferrocene, that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|The final {{transition}} to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, Victoria.

In recognition of British rule over India, Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the republican movement, due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of her husband in 1861.|$|E

40|$|Objective This review {{summarizes}} some {{patterns of}} pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy {{in children with}} medically refractory seizures. Epilepsy surgery is a valuable therapeutic option for many children with intractable epilepsy. The most effective treatment for intractable partial epilepsy is a focal cortical resection with excision of the area of ictal onset and initial seizure propagation (the epileptogenic zone). EEG monitoring continues to prove indispensable in pre-surgical planning of refractory epileptic patients by defining the epileptogenic zone. <b>Technological</b> <b>progresses</b> in both structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have led many medical centers to consider surgical treatment of epilepsy. In children undergoing pre-surgical evaluation, the goals of neuroimaging studies include the identification of structural abnormalities in the brain, eloquent regions of the brain including language, memory, and sensorimotor functions, and the relation of these regions to the potential epileptogenic region.

25|$|Solow {{also was}} the first to develop a growth model with {{different}} vintages of capital. The idea behind Solow's vintage capital growth model is that new capital is more valuable than old (vintage) capital because new capital is produced through known technology. Within the confines of Solow's model, this known technology is assumed to be constantly improving. Consequently, the products of this technology (the new capital) are expected to be more productive as well as more valuable. The idea lay dormant for some time perhaps because Dale W. Jorgenson (1966) argued that it was observationally equivalent with disembodied <b>technological</b> <b>progress,</b> as advanced earlier in Solow (1957). It was successfully pushed forward in subsequent research by Jeremy Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz and Per Krusell (1997), who argued that the secular decline in capital goods prices could be used to measure embodied <b>technological</b> <b>progress.</b> They labeled the notion investment-specific <b>technological</b> <b>progress.</b> Solow (2001) approved.

O conceito de universidade corporativa surgiu nos EUA, em 1995, quando a General Eletric criou a Cotronville. Mas foi só a partir da década de 80 que se assistiu a um aumento considerável destes novos espaços de formação. Outro componente que contribuiu para o rápido crescimento das universidades corporativas é a necessidade de contínua aprendizagem, como conseqüência das vertiginosas mudanças no mundo do trabalho, em razão dos avanços tecnológicos permanentes e do processo de globalização da economia. As universidades corporativas surgem como solução para o alinhamento das iniciativas de treinamento com a estratégia da organização e de criação de vantagem competitiva, por meio de aprendizado permanente.
