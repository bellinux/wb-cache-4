25|$|The British {{referred}} to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre (so called due {{to the location of}} the fighting {{and the name of the}} headquarters that controlled the initial fighting: Middle East Command) while the Americans called the theatre of operations the Mediterranean Theater of War. The German official history of <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> dubbed The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939–1942. Regardless of the size of the theatre, the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of one vast theatre of war.|$|E
25|$|The emperor is astounded at {{the noble}} bearing of this merchant's son and asks the boy if Clement is his real father. Florent replies equivocally. Clement {{explains}} truthfully {{how he came}} by {{the child and the}} Emperor realises that Florent is his long-lost son. The next morning, Florent rides out to the pavilion of the Saracen king, provoking, by his confident boasts, a military engagement the very next day. He rides back to Paris to warn everybody of the impending battle. The next day the forces engage and <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> long and hard. Sir Florent performs magnificently, wearing Marsabelle's sleeve on his lance, and saves the Christian forces from defeat. As night falls and the armies fall back, Florent rides to where Marsabelle is staying, where she vows to marry him and become a Christian, and warns him about her father's invincible horse.|$|E

Over the next couple of days, several missiles landed randomly on the city's airport road and in nearby districts such as Abu Sleem, Seraj and Krimea among others. Rocket attacks in Hadba killed several people, including a 59-year-old Indian worker. In Tripoli's western suburb of Janzour, the local Fursan Janzour militia as well as the National Mobile Forces camp, {{which is part of the}} Misrata-led Operation Dawn and allied to the militia, came under attack and were overrun by Zintan's Barq al-Nasr Brigade, backed by Warshefana forces.

500|$|Faust {{noted the}} cynicism about the brony fandom, and commented that in {{considering}} the idea of grown men watching a show for little girls, [...] "They think there's something wrong with that, something devious about it"; she noted that it was [...] "upsetting to me that people jump to those conclusions". Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at girls {{will be easier to}} sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived.

500|$|The 17th-century rise of Britain's American {{colonies and}} the rapid 18th-century {{expansion}} of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised {{in what was then}} the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. [...] He may have arrived in the Caribbean {{in the last years of}} the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a slave ship). [...] The 18th-century author Charles Johnson claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during the War of the Spanish Succession, and that [...] "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage". [...] At what point during the war Teach joined <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is,</b> in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.|$|E

500|$|Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD (now part of Mania.com) gave {{positive}} reviews {{to the two}} New Cutey Honey Collections {{released in}} 2000 by ADV; he [...] "was really impressed with the production values of this show" [...] and called it [...] "quite a bit of fun, especially for those looking for fan-service with a bit more intelligence and style {{than some of the}} other offerings out there". [...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can see why it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joséphine convinces Barras {{to suggest}} to the National Assembly that Napoleon is the best man to quell a royalist uprising. On 3 October 1795 Napoleon accepts, and {{supplies}} 800 guns for defense. Directed by Napoleon, Major Joachim Murat (Genica Missirio) seizes a number of cannon to fight the royalists. Di Borgo shoots at Napoleon but misses; di Borgo is then wounded by Fleuri's accidental musket discharge. Saliceti is prevented from escaping in disguise. Napoleon sets Saliceti and di Borgo free. Joseph Fouché (Guy Favière) tells Joséphine that the noise of <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> Napoleon [...] "entering history again".

Very hypothetically this may have been the same attack that was mentioned in a much later Swedish chronicle, the mid-16th century Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium by Bishop Paulus Juusten, that records the Russians burning [...] "Turku" [...] in 1198, at the time of Bishop Folquinus.

[...] "A ceasefire {{would not be a}} solution. <b>The</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> still going on.

On late 9 August, it was claimed by Russian military commanders that Georgian forces were expelled from Tskhinvali. This claim was rejected by Saakashvili. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, claimed that [...] "98 percent of Tskhinvali" [...] was destroyed, adding, [...] "Our troops have re-established control over the city."

2500|$|In an {{overview}} of the series, Jason Thompson called Ranma ½ [...] "the direct ancestor of all comedy-action manga, like Sumomomo Momomo and History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi", although noted that it was not the first, but only spanned the period when manga and anime sales were at their height. Relating it to Takahashi's other works, he summed the series up as [...] "At the start, <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> minimal and it's almost a semi-serious relationship comedy, like Maison Ikkoku; then it turns completely ridiculous; and by the climax, when Ranma fights the evil bird-people of Phoenix Mountain in an excessively long and un-funny shonen fight scene, it's like a warmup for Inuyasha." [...] He states that [...] "Eventually Takahashi adds too many characters, and the manga starts repeating itself. Because of the lack of a strong story arc, a lot of people stop reading Ranma ½ {{at some point in the}} middle". Reviewing Viz Media's final English volume of the manga, Anime News Network remarked that [...] "Every dimension of Rumiko Takahashi's storytelling skills come into play here: comedy, romance and introspection, and of course, high-flying fantasy martial-arts action." [...] However, they felt some of the action scenes were hard to follow and noted that the mirroring to left-to-right format caused errors with the art.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, {{the first}} {{official}} news came from German wireless broadcasts. Ships began to arrive in port, their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival {{and the loss of}} some 6,000 others. Authorities considered suppressing the news, but it had already spread widely. Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives, while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered. At 19:00 on 2 June, the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side. The following day British newspapers reported a German victory. The Daily Mirror described the German Director of the Naval Department telling the Reichstag: [...] "The result of <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> a significant success for our forces against a much stronger adversary". The British population was shocked that the long anticipated battle had been a victory for Germany. On 3 June, the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses, and another the following day with exaggerated claims. However, on 7 June the German admission of the losses of [...] Lützow and Rostock started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss. International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory, the German attempt to change {{the balance of power in}} the North Sea having been repulsed. In July, bad news from the Somme campaign swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Daredevil is {{the first}} of the ordered Netflix series, and is {{followed}} by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E
