40|$|Nucleotide {{oligomerization}} domain‐containing protein 2 (Nod 2), {{an innate}} immune receptor, recognizes bacterial cell‐wall peptidoglycan (PGN), the minimum ligand {{of which is}} muramyl dipeptide (MDP). Enzymatic digestion of PGN appears to be important for Nod 2 recognition. PGN is degraded by muramidase or glucosamidase through a process that produces two types of glycan sequence; glycans containing GlcNAcβ(1 → 4) MurNAc or MurNAcβ(1 → 4) GlcNAc. In this report, a range of disaccharide or tetrasaccharide fragments of each sequence were chemically synthesized, and their activities in stimulating human Nod 2 (hNod 2) were investigated. The results reveal that hNod 2 recognitions {{is dependent on the}} glycan sequence, as demonstrated by comparing the activities of glycans with the same peptide moieties. (MurNAcβ(1 → 4) GlcNAc) 2 ‐containing structures exhibited stronger activity than those containing (GlcNAcβ(1 → 4) MurNAc) 2. The results suggest that differences in the enzymatic degradation process affect the host's immunomodulation process. <b>To</b> <b>Nod</b> <b>off</b> or on? Di‐ or tetrasaccharide fragments of muramidase and glucosamidase were chemically synthesized, and their abilities to stimulate human Nod 2 were investigated. The results reveal that hNod 2 recognition is glycan sequence‐dependent, and suggest that the peptidoglycan degradation process affects the host's immunomodulation...|$|E
40|$|Imagine this. Your baby is {{two weeks}} old, {{and you have}} finally settled her to sleep for the night in her cot, in the newly painted nursery next to your room. You are awakened from a short, but deep, sleep, by distressed crying, and you stagger out of bed. You turn on the lamp and pick up her up. She is red-faced and too loud for {{that time of the}} morning, and her crying has awoken your partner, who you can hear sighing loudly next door. After a few minutes, you calm her and persuade her to breastfeed. After some time, just as you are about <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> <b>off</b> yourself, she falls off the breast contentedly. Slowly and carefully- you are more awake now, appreciating the {{delicacy}} of this manoeuvre- you slide her into the cot. Only two steps away from the door, and she whimpers. As you turn the door handle, she cries softly, and then increasingly loudly. Your partner, angel that he is, comes in bleary eyed and offers to walk the corridor with her, which he does for 15 minutes before putting her gently back in her cot...|$|E

50|$|According {{to local}} legend, the {{thunderstorm}} {{was the result}} of a visit by the devil who had made a pact with a local card player and gambler called Jan Reynolds (or Bobby Read, according to the tale recorded at the Tavistock Inn, Poundsgate). The deal was that if the devil ever found him asleep in church, he could have his soul. Jan was said <b>to</b> have <b>nodded</b> <b>off</b> during the service that day, with his pack of cards in his hand. Another version of the legend states that the Devil arrived to collect the souls of four people playing cards during the church service.|$|R
5000|$|A. atra {{has some}} {{ability to change}} colour, {{although}} not {{to the same extent}} as chameleons, of which the Agamidae are a sister group. When a male agama in breeding colouration is approached by a potential predator, it will lie flat against a rock and lose the intense breeding colours in favour of more cryptic colouration. A dominant male usually occupies a high point in the area and performs a pushup display and head <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> warn <b>off</b> intruders.|$|R
