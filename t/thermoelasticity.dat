In general, <b>thermoelasticity</b> {{is concerned with}} elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic.

50|$|Biot's {{early work}} with von Kármán {{and during the}} World War II working for the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics led to the {{development}} of the three-dimensional theory of aircraft flutter. During the period between 1932 and 1942, he conceived and then fully developed the response spectrum method (RSM) for earthquake engineering. For irreversible thermodynamics, Biot utilized the variational approach and was the first to introduce the dissipation function and the minimum dissipation principle to account for the dissipation phenomenon, which {{led to the development}} of <b>thermoelasticity,</b> heat transfer, viscoelasticity, and thermorheology. Biot’s interest in the non-linear effects of initial stress and the inelastic behavior of solids led to his mathematical theory of folding of stratified rocks. In the period between 1935 and 1962 Biot published a number of scientific papers that lay the foundations of the theory of poroelasticity (now known as Biot theory), which describes the mechanical behaviour of fluid-saturated porous media.|$|E

Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted , is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame [...] by establishing a coordinate system R with origin O. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame , can be considered to give a physical realization of [...] In a frame , coordinates are changed from R to Rby carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of intrinsic objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities in this frame.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} paper is to study the thermoelastic {{interactions}} in an unbounded elastic medium with a spherical cavity {{in the context of}} four different theories of <b>thermoelasticity,</b> namely: the classical coupled dynamical <b>thermoelasticity,</b> the extended <b>thermoelasticity,</b> the temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> and the <b>thermoelasticity</b> without energy dissipation in a unified way. The cavity surface is assumed to be stress free and is subjected to a smooth and time-dependent-heating effect. The solutions for displacement, temperature and stresses are obtained {{with the help of the}} Laplace transform procedure. Firstly the short-time approximated solutions for four different theories have been obtained analytically. Then following the numerical method proposed by Bellman et al. [R. Bellmen, R. E. Kolaba, J. A. Lockette, Numerical Inversion of the Laplace Transform, American Elsevier Pub. Co., New York, 1966] for the inversion of Laplace transforms, the numerical values of the physical quantities are also computed for the copper material and results are displayed in graphical forms to compare the results obtained for the theory of <b>thermoelasticity</b> without energy dissipation with the results of other <b>thermoelasticity</b> theories...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> is {{a theory}} of <b>thermoelasticity</b> in which two {{relaxation}} times are introduced into the equations of classical <b>thermoelasticity.</b> An important consequence of this theory is that heat now travels at a finite speed rather than the infinite speed implied by the diffusion equation. In an anisotropic temperature-rate-dependent thermoelastic material, {{it is found that}} four plane harmonic waves may propagate in any direction, all dispersive and attenuated, yet all are stable in the sense that their amplitudes remain bounded. An alternative theory that forces heat to travel at finite speed is generalized <b>thermoelasticity</b> in which the rate of change of heat flux also appears in the heat conduction equation, thereby introducing a relaxation time. Two different methods of combining the effects of temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> and generalized <b>thermoelasticity</b> are discussed, and it is found {{that at least some of}} the four waves become unstable...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study wave {{stability}} {{in the context of}} three theories of thermoelasticity: temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> TRDTE which was formulated by Green and Lindsay [21]; temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> with generalized <b>thermoelasticity,</b> which we label TRDTE + GTE (1), formulated by Chandrasekharaiah and Keshavan [23]; and an alternative theory of temperature-ratedependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> with generalized <b>thermoelasticity,</b> labelled TRDTE + GTE (2), formulated by Ignaczak [25]. Both anisotropic and isotropic thermoelastic materials are under consideration in this thesis. We are concerned with three cases: unconstrained; the usual deformation-temperature constraint; and the alternative deformation-temperature constraint. We �nd that in all these cases wave stability/ instability is a�ected by the occurrence of the relaxation times � 0 and � 1 in TRDTE, and � 0, � 1 and � in TRDTE + GTE (1) and TRDTE + GTE (2) ...|$|E

40|$|Temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> is {{a theory}} of <b>thermoelasticity</b> in which the stress, entropy and heat flux are {{permitted}} {{to depend on the}} rate of change of temperature and the temperature gradient, as well as the usual variables of temperature and deformation gradient. This has the effect of introducing two relaxation times into the equations of <b>thermoelasticity.</b> Another important effect is that heat now travels at a finite speed rather than the infinite speed implied by the diffusion equation. In an isotropic temperature-rate-dependent thermoelastic material, it is found that four plane harmonic waves may propagate: two purely elastic transverse waves and two longitudinal waves that are dispersive and attenuated. All four waves are stable in the sense that their amplitude remains bounded. An alternative theory that forces heat to travel at finite speed is that of generalized <b>thermoelasticity,</b> in which the rate of change of heat flux also appears in the heat conduction equation, thereby introducing a relaxation time. Two different methods of combining the effects of temperature-rate-dependent <b>thermoelasticity</b> and generalized <b>thermoelasticity</b> are discussed and it is found that the transverse waves are unaltered but that {{one or both of the}} longitudinal waves become unstable...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to study coupled thermoelastic behaviors in disks subjected to thermal shock loads based on the generalized and classic theories of coupled <b>thermoelasticity.</b> To this end, this research {{has been carried out}} in two stages. In the first stage, <b>thermoelasticity</b> problems in an axisymmetric rotating disk with constant thickness made of a homogeneous isotropic material are analytically solved and closed-form formulations are presented for temperature and displacement fields. Since, the analytical solution is not always feasible, the finite element (FE) method can be employed for more sophisticated coupled <b>thermoelasticity</b> problems. Accordingly, in the second stage of the research, a novel refined 1 D finite element approach with 3 D-like accuracies are developed for theories of coupled <b>thermoelasticity.</b> Then, the developed FE models are applied for a 3 D solution of the dynamic generalized coupled <b>thermoelasticity</b> problem in disks. Use of the reduced models with low computational costs may be of interest in a laborious time history analysis of the dynamic problems.
