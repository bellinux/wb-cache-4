Afterward Constantine left for the last struggle. Many people remained all the night in the church, praying for the salvation of the city.

25|$|The Koolie's {{ancestors}} were the smooth coated blue merle Collie (imported from Britain in the 19th century) and the Black and Tan Collie from the Highlands of Scotland; {{these were the}} same type imported by Thomas Hall {{for the creation of}} his Heelers. The Koolie is believed to be descended from the same Collie types that were brought to Australia for the kennels of Thomas S. Hall (an originator of the Australian Cattle Dog breed); some believe that they could be direct descendants of Hall's dogs. While some believe the 'German Coolie' to be descended from the 'German Tiger', a European herding dog, there is no genetic or even anecdotal evidence to support this claim. A more plausible theory is that these dogs were used by German immigrants in South Australia who, unable to correctly pronounce 'collie', referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> as 'coolies'. Others have noted strong similarities with the Australian Koolie and the Welsh Collie, another British herding subtype.|$|E

25|$|Caribou or wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti (tuntu, tuntupik or tuntupiaq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tuntupig in Cup'ig). Prior to European contact, caribou were {{important}} not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. The second most commonly received resources for Manokotak residents were caribou (%64.8 of households). Caribou meat was often made into jerky. The stomach contents such as sedges and other greens, were eaten. Virtually all of the edible parts of the animal was utilized. Caribou have been absent from Nunivak Island for at least 100 years, {{but many of the}} procedures for preparing the flesh of this animal also apply to the domestic reindeer. In earlier times, however, caribou livers were placed in the animal's stomach to ferment; this is no longer done. The lining of a reindeer stomach was cut up and eaten with dried fish or by itself. Lungs and kidneys were given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> but the heart was eaten. Neither caribou meat nor fish were ever pounded as a method of preservation.|$|E

500|$|The Welsh Corgi ( [...] , Welsh for [...] "dwarf dog"; plural [...] "corgis" [...] or {{occasionally}} the etymologically consistent [...] "corgwn" [...] (...) [...] ) {{is a small}} type of herding dog that originated in Wales. Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Historically, the Pembroke {{has been attributed to}} the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.|$|E
500|$|Bred in {{the village}} of Bedlington in Northumberland, the Bedlington Terrier has been {{described}} as [...] "the favourite companion of the northern miners". They were originally known as Rodbury Terriers, Rothbury Terriers, or [...] "Rothbury's Lambs", because the Lord of Rothbury had taken a particular liking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> Before this, they were known as [...] "gypsy dogs", as gypsies and poachers used them to hunt. The first mention of the Bedlington terrier, or as it was then known, the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, was in 1825, most likely in The Life of James Allen, but some dogs' pedigrees have been traced as far back as 1782. James' father, William, was much in demand as an otter hunter, and he kept Bedlington Terriers in order to help him hunt. They were also valued by their owners as rabbit coursing dogs and racing dogs, until the Whippet became more popular as a racing dog and a courser.|$|E
500|$|By the 1890s, {{the dogs}} had {{attracted}} the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term [...] "Australian Cattle Dog" [...] to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's [...] "heelers", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote [...] "in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.|$|E

500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a generic {{description}} for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a [...] "pocket" [...] or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: [...] Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.|$|E
