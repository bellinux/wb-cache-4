25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid</b> balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{resistance}} to infection, {{which does not}} depend on antibiotics, is a powerful protective mechanism common to all mankind that has been responsible for the survival of our species during countless millennia in the past. The normal functioning of this complex system of phagocytic cells and <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids</b> is entirely dependent on an extremely low level of free ionic iron (10 ” 18 M) in <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids.</b> This low-iron environment is maintained by the unsaturated iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, which depend on well-oxygenated tissues, where a relatively high oxidation–reduction potential (Eh) and pH are essential for the binding of ferric iron. Freely available iron is derived from iron overload, free haem compounds, or hypoxia in injured tissue leading to a fall in Eh and pH. This can severely damage or abolish normal bactericidal mechanisms in <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids</b> leading to overwhelming growth of bacteria or fungi. The challenge for clinical medicine is to reduce or eliminate the presence of freely available iron in clinical disease. In injured or hypoxic tissue, treatment with hyperbaric oxygen might prove very useful by increasing tissue oxygenation and restoring normal bactericidal mechanisms in <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids,</b> which would be of huge benefit to the patient...|$|R
50|$|Not {{all of the}} {{contents}} of the blood pass into the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid,</b> which means that <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid</b> and blood are not the same.

50|$|Like enamel, dentin is avascular. Nutrition for odontoblasts {{within the}} dentin {{comes through the}} dentinal tubules from <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid</b> that {{originally}} traveled from the blood vessels located in the adjacent pulp tissue. Within each dentinal tubule is a space of variable size containing dentinal fluid, an odontoblastic process, and possibly an afferent axon (see next discussion).

50|$|The {{balance between}} the two forces differs at {{different}} points on the capillaries. At the arterial end of a vessel, the hydrostatic pressure {{is greater than the}} osmotic pressure, so the net movement (see net flux) favors water and other solutes being passed into the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid.</b> At the venous end, the osmotic pressure is greater, so the net movement favors substances being passed back into the capillary. This difference is created by the direction of the flow of blood and the imbalance in solutes created by the net movement of water favoring the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E

40|$|MacDougal and Cannon 1 and MacDougal 2 {{suggested}} {{some years}} ago that the osmotic concentration of the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids</b> of the two organisms is one of the fundamental variables in the relationship between plant parasite and host. Senn 3 has published one plasmolytic determination indicating higher concentration in a Viscum than in the leaves of the host tree and has secured similar results with other phanerogamic parasites. In the Jamaican montane rain-forest the concentration of the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids</b> of the parasitic Loranthaceae is in general higher than those of the host. 4 The same relationship has been found to obtain in desert Loranthaceae. 5 As far as we are aware the relative electrolyte contents of the <b>tissue</b> <b>fluids</b> of parasite and host have not been determined heretofore. In August, 1920, we had the opportunity while carrying out work for the U. S. Department of Agriculture at Sacaton, Arizona to measure the specific electrical conductivity, K, as well as the osmotic concentration in atmospheres, P, calculated from the freezing point lowering, Δ, of the expressed sap of the leaves of the host trees and of the stems of the leafless Phoradendron californiczmz parasitic on the leguminous trees Acacia greggii and Olneya tesota and of the leaves of the leafy P. cockerellii parasitic on Populus wislizeni, Salix wriglztii and Fraxinus attenuata. Sap was extracted after antecedent freezing of the tissues in an ice and salt mixture 1 to facilitate extraction 2 and the constants determined on the centrifuged sap.

40|$|Skeletal muscle {{dispersion}} {{and optical}} clearing (OC) kinetics were studied experimentally {{to prove the}} existence of the refractive index (RI) matching mechanism of OC.

40|$|Sensitization of mesenchymal {{cells to}} {{tuberculin}} occurs regularly {{during the course}} of tuberculous infections in guinea pigs; this can be shown by the specific toxic action of tuberculin acting on these cells in tissue cultures (1).

50|$|Organisms of the salivary {{microbiome}} {{reside in}} the three major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual.

50|$|Upon {{contact with}} PAMPs, tissue macrophages and mastocytes release {{vasoactive}} amines such as histamine and serotonin, {{as well as}} eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release nitric oxide. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the blood vessels, which results in the net distribution of blood plasma from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell (edema). This exuded <b>tissue</b> <b>fluid</b> contain various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as complement, lysozyme, antibodies, which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes {{in preparation for the}} cellular phase. If the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound, exuded platelets, coagulants, plasmin and kinins can clot the wounded area and provide haemostasis in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site {{in the form of a}} fibrin lattice - as would construction scaffolding at a construction site - for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and wound repair later on.

40|$|We have {{estimated}} that the concentration achieved by OHcyE in injured coronary artery tissue is at least near-saturating, because the solubility of homocystine in physiological-like condition, above which deposition of homocystine and/or cysteine-homocysteine as solid phase occurs, almost exactly matches its value.

40|$|Inflammation {{involves}} local physiological {{changes in}} the permeability of capillaries, {{in the rate of}} blood flow, and perhaps in the normal balance of body fluids. Increase of capillary permeability is shown by local edema.
