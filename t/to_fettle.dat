Telemetry data derived from global partners such as DTM, WTCC, ADAC GT Masters and KW Suspensions {{is also used}} to further develop the physics model of the cars.|$|E

The feeder {{is connected to}} casting through a neck, <b>to</b> facilitate the <b>fettling</b> of feeder from casting. The design of feeder and neck in a foundry is largely based on past experience and empirical rules. This paper discusses the design of feeder neck and effect of heat accumulation on the design...|$|R
60|$|After {{the eight}} o'clock bell had rung, Hendry {{occasionally}} crossed {{over to the}} farm of T'nowhead {{and sat on the}} pig-sty. If no one joined him he scratched the pig, and returned home gradually. Here what was almost a club held informal meetings, at which two or four, or even half a dozen assembled to debate, when there was any one to start them. The meetings were only memorable when Tammas Haggart was in <b>fettle,</b> <b>to</b> pronounce judgments in his well-known sarcastic way. Sometimes we had got off the pig-sty to separate before Tammas was properly yoked. There we might remain a long time, planted round him like trees, for he was a mesmerising talker.|$|R

An' {{he went to work}} a-practicin' 'air-dyes the very next day, beginnin' on some white rabbits he had, an' then he drored all Rip's markin's on t' back of a white Commissariat bullock, so as to get his 'and in an' be sure of his colors; shadin' off brown into black as nateral as life. If Rip hed a fault it was too mich markin', but it was straingely reg'lar an' Orth'ris settled himself to make a fost-rate job on it when he got haud o' t' Canteen Sargint's dog. Theer niver was sich a dog as thot for bad temper, an' it did nut get no better when his tail hed <b>to</b> be <b>fettled</b> an inch an' a half shorter. But they may talk o' theer Royal Academies as they like. I niver seed a bit o' animal paintin' to beat t' copy as Orth'ris made of Rip's marks, wal t' picter itself was snarlin' all t' time an' tryin' to get at Rip standin' theer to be copied as good as goold.|$|R
5000|$|A fettler {{is an old}} craft {{from the}} iron and steel {{industry}} that grew in the north east of England. His job was to remove the excess material from castings, by [...] "fettling" [...] them. <b>To</b> <b>fettle</b> is to put right, fix: 'I'll fettle you'. The word remains in common use in the North East and is synonymous in the area with the group.|$|E
50|$|Hodgetts {{debuted in}} the British Touring Car Championship in 1980. His first overall podium place came in 1981 {{when he came}} second. He was {{consistent}} {{in the top five}} after that, mostly driving for the works Toyota team. He came fourth in 1983, fifth in 1984, second in 1985, before winning the series in 1986 and 1987 at the wheel of a Group C Toyota Corolla. The 1988 season was not a success. The new Group A Toyota Supra needed a lot of development, and only a handful of good results were gained. His last race in the BTCC was in 1990. That season he drove for the works Vauxhall team, helping <b>to</b> <b>fettle</b> the new Vauxhall Cavalier. Towards {{the end of the year}} he switched to a Ford Sierra, before calling time on his BTCC career. During the 1989 season, Hodgetts was driving for Brooklyns in an iconic red Ford Sierra RS500.|$|E
40|$|Through ethnographic {{research}} amongst {{farmers in}} the North York Moors, and through broader historical and political analysis, I examine the importance and role of values in hard work and beneficent change in negotiated interactions between policy-makers, farmers and conservationists. Within {{the context of a}} shift in agricultural support away from production to environmental protection, and {{within the context of a}} local conservation initiative to protect a population of freshwater pearl mussels in the River Esk, I show the importance of these values for the construction of farmers' personhoods and their symbolic relations and means of expression through the landscape. I show how those values are persistent and pervasive, yet at the same time mutable and open to interpretation. In particular, I examine alternative conceptions of beneficent change through recourse <b>to</b> the words <b>fettle</b> and improvement. Fettling places value in long-term, steady and incremental change, whereas improvement places value in changes more closely associated with productivist ideals such as expansion and profit. I suggest that it is the mutability of farming values that gives rise to their persistence as they come to be used and reinterpreted according to the changing contexts of their application and the differing interests of a range of groups and individuals. By showing that farmers are able to uphold and express their values differently I argue that it is not so straightforward to predict farmers' responses to changing political exigencies or local conservation initiatives on the basis of homogenous values or the categorisation of farmers into defined "types". Through a rhetoric-culture approach I argue that changes in farming values through time do not merely reflect changing political interests and farmers' subsequent accommodation of them. Rather, it reflects the continued negotiation of those values between farmers and others in the play of agents and patients in the construction of personhood and the formulation of arguments. I argue that the persistence of fettling interpretations of a value in beneficent change reflects the agentive actions of farmers as it remains a useful argumentative strategy with which they can make indictments against new policy impositions and, moreover, it remains functional in guiding their practices in ways suitable to the environment in which they farm.
