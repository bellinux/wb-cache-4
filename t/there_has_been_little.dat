5|$|Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, {{construction}} of {{the first section of}} the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to a high-quality specification. The remainder of the road was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade the road or replace it with a parallel motorway, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>little</b> change in the century since the route was first planned and most of the road is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution {{and is one of the}} least popular roads in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. Because <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>little</b> to no modern excavation in the canyon, the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.|$|E

5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for {{which there was no}} adult equivalent. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>little</b> recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>little</b> {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E
