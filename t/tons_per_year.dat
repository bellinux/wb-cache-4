5|$|As {{porbeagles}} {{had become}} scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved {{west to the}} waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, {{they were joined by}} longline vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (smeriglio) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. There is evidence that incidental artificial selection caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens of <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> from 1996 to 2005.

5|$|Work resumed {{under the}} {{supervision}} of Priddy, but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard, who had been the engineer for the Coventry Canal. The canal was opened in stages as it was completed. It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777, Ryeford in January 1779, and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779. It had cost £40,930, which had been raised by calling £150 on each £100 share, by borrowing money from the shareholders, by running up debts, and by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open. Traffic was around 16,000 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> which enabled the company to repay the debts and to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786.|$|E
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
5|$|Intensive {{fishing for}} the {{porbeagle}} dates back the 1930s, when Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.|$|E

5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> throughout its life.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four <b>tons</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigation of methane emission potential for municipal solid wastelandfill sites in Iran and declining approaches. Methods: In this study methane emission rate from MSW landfill sites in Iran was estimated by IPCC (2000) method. Also emitted methane amounts from three different scenarios of MSW land filling and recycling have beensurveyed in Iran. Results: The results showed that methane emission rate from unsanitary MSW landfill site in existence situation of(first scenario) was 1. 682 million <b>ton</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> which would be equal with 162. 7 kilo gram of methane <b>per</b> <b>ton</b> ofburied MSW. In this scenario, methane emission portion from MSW landfill sites on Iran in comparison to globalrate was 4. 67 percent. Conclusion: Based on the results, in first scenario if MSW land fill sites became sanitized and methane recoveryfrom these sites carried out (second scenario) methane emission would be reduced to rate of 0. 7 million <b>ton</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Also appropriate recycling of MSW in Iran up to 80 percent and land filling of residual solid waste with recoveringof generated methane (third scenario) was reduced methane emission to rate of 0. 158 million <b>ton</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> So, it hasbeen recommended intensively that sanitary land filling processes and appropriate MSW recycling would beconsidered as two significantly important actions for methane emission decreasing on Iran MSW landfill sites...|$|R
