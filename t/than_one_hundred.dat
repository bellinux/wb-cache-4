5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E

When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.|$|E

This paper defends a novel analysis of numerical imprecision based {{on the notion of}} scale granularity, construed here in terms of sets of alternatives. I apply this approach to account for previously unnoticed facts relating to the interaction of (im) precision and comparison, in particular the necessarily precise interpretation of measure expressions in comparatives, and the negative polarity status of overt approximators in comparatives (e. g., Mabel owns *(no) more <b>than</b> about <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> sheep) ...|$|R
5|$|Harihara, (also {{known as}} Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the Girijakalyana {{in the old}} Jain Champu style which {{describes}} the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections.

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{overview}} of our ongoing systematic search for wide (sub) stellar companions around the stars known to host rad-vel planets. By using a relatively large field of view and going very deep our survey can find all directly detectable stellar and brown dwarf companions (m> 40 MJup) within a 1000 AU orbit. As of may 2003 more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>hundreds</b> extra-solar were found. Some of those planets are found in binary stellar systems. Those cases are intriguing, and might even exhibit some statistical different features than the planets around single stars (Zucker & Mazeh 2002). It is therefore that we started a systematic deep imaging of the stars known to have planets to look for faint companions in wide orbits. Several groups have already searched for very close stellar companions using adaptive optics, but these searched could not find wide companions due to their too small field of view. By using a relatively large field of view and going very deep our survey will find all stellar and even brown dwarf companions (m> 40 MJup) within a 1000 AU orbit...|$|R
