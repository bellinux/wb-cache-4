He also {{spent a lot of}} time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: [...] "I do not want you to be cut back like a workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit on your shoulders, all day long", did he say to his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation.|$|E

40|$|Public {{concern about}} leakage from {{microwave}} ovens is present {{from the beginning}} of its use when many people believed that the leakage was similar to atomic radiation and could result in serious health problems, including cancer. This paper presents the results of the evaluation of electromagnetic emissions produced by microwave ovens that are in the area of meals of the ITM campus Fraternidad and are used by students, teachers and workers to heat food. First, measurements were made at 5 cm from <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> maximum values of leakage generated by <b>the</b> <b>ovens.</b> Subsequently, it was evaluated the electric field level in <b>the</b> surrounding tables <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> levels <b>to</b> which people <b>to</b> frequent <b>the</b> area were exposed. The results show that the highest level found does not exceed the limits set by international standards (5 mW/cm 2) and does not even reach 1 % of this value. </p...|$|R
50|$|During its reconstruction, the Colonel {{had a new}} {{foundation}} poured, {{which created}} a basement. In the basement, he had ovens installed whose vents and chimney extended underground beneath Route 25 to a structure that once stood on the other side. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens,</b> marble slabs and cooling racks were also installed. It is thought that at one time, the windmill basement was an operating bakery. During the flour rationing of World War I, the bakery supposedly produced bread for the Fabyan family and even for their two bears, Tom and Jerry. However, the extent of use of the mill's bakery is debatable due to an inadequate oven draft.|$|R

Four clubs tried to get his signature and it was with Richmond who were successful. However, he would spend only one season at Richmond, playing 14 games.

50|$|During the communityâs mining heyday, the Ore Mountains yielded forth iron, {{silver and}} sulphur. The ores were {{processed}} at a smelter.

60|$|Becky bustled off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> {{with her}} pies, and Emily roamed {{away to the}} big barn to lie on the hay, enjoying the view down the valley, as she thought over what she had seen and heard, and very {{naturally}} contrasted her own luxurious and tenderly guarded life with this other girl's, so hard and dull and narrow. Working all summer and teaching all winter in that dismal little school-house, with no change but home cares and carpet-weaving! It looked horrible to pleasure-loving Emily, who led the happy, care-free life of girls of her class, with pleasures of all sorts, and a future of still greater luxury, variety, and happiness, opening brightly before her.|$|E
60|$|Miriam {{was moving}} about {{preparing}} dinner. Paul watched everything that happened. His face {{was pale and}} thin, {{but his eyes were}} quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange, almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great stew-jar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse, that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden, the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical. And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} Grettel {{had to go out}} and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire.

[...] She pushed Grettel out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> from which fiery flames were already issuing. [...] "Creep in," [...] said the witch, [...] "and see if it's {{properly}} heated, so that we can shove in the bread." [...] For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: [...] "I don't know how I'm to do it; how do I get in?" [...] "You silly goose!" [...] said the hag, [...] "the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself," [...] and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.|$|E
