5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.

Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.|$|E
5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E

Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E

After the family left, {{the doors of the}} presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E

5|$|Trump {{was granted}} {{permission}} by the City of New York {{to build the}} top 20 stories of the building in exchange for operating the atrium as a city-administered privately owned public space. In <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building are two Trump merchandise kiosks (one of which replaced a long public bench) operating out of compliance with city regulations. The city issued a notice of violation in July 2015, demanding the bench be put back in place. Although the Trump Organization initially said that the violation was without merit, a lawyer speaking for Trump's organization stated in January 2016 that the kiosks would be removed in two to four weeks, prior to an expected court ruling.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
25|$|In its {{fight against}} growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the {{political}} and legal sphere (mainly <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> Nations and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> Nations vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.|$|R

50|$|During the 1950s, the SCW campaigned against <b>the</b> {{practice}} <b>of</b> polygamy, {{advocated for}} child care and <b>lobbied</b> <b>the</b> government to make reforms in prostitution. SCW was also concerned about women and divorce practices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. In February <b>of</b> 1953, <b>the</b> SCW opened the first girls club in Singapore at the Joo Chiat Welfare Centre. In 1959, <b>the</b> SCW <b>lobbied</b> <b>the</b> country's political parties to include women's rights under marriage in their platforms. <b>The</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCW helped speed <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Women's Charter and the Muslim Ordinance.|$|R
5|$|In November 1909, {{industrialist}} Ambrose O'Brien of Renfrew, Ontario, was in Montreal {{to purchase}} supplies for a railway contract. At {{the request of}} the Renfrew Creamery Kings hockey team, he attended the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) meetings, held at the Windsor Hotel, to represent Renfrew in its application to join the league. At the meeting, the ECHA team owners rejected Renfrew's application. Later that day the ECHA's owners chose to disband their league and form the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in a bid to exclude the Montreal Wanderers, who had upset the other owners when they moved into a smaller arena that would reduce the visiting team's share of gate receipts. In <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel, O'Brien met Jimmy Gardner, manager of the Wanderers, and discussed forming a new league which would include Renfrew, the Wanderers, and two teams that O'Brien owned in the Ontario mining towns of Cobalt and Haileybury. Gardner suggested that O'Brien start a team of francophone players based in Montreal, forming a rivalry with the Wanderers. As a result, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was founded on December 2, 1909, and Les Canadiens were created two days later, initially financed by O'Brien with the intent of transferring ownership to francophone sportsmen in Montreal as soon as possible.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LDS Church {{began to}} focus its {{attention}} on <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> same-sex marriages. In 1993, <b>the</b> Supreme Court <b>of</b> Hawaii held that discrimination against same-sex couples in <b>the</b> granting <b>of</b> marriage licenses violated the Hawaiian constitution. In response, the church's First Presidency issued a statement on February 13, 1994 declaring their opposition to same-sex marriage, and urging members to support efforts to outlaw it. With <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LDS Church and several other religious organizations, the Hawaii legislature enacted a bill in 1994 outlawing same-sex marriages.|$|R

2500|$|Despite these diverse {{developments}}, {{developments in}} fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size. [...] In the early 1970s, however, anti-nuclear protests in Denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22kW. [...] Organizing owners into associations and co-operatives lead to <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later. [...] Local activists in Germany, nascent turbine manufacturers in Spain, and large {{investors in the}} United States in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries. [...] Later companies formed in India and China. [...] As of 2012, Danish company Vestas is the world's biggest wind-turbine manufacturer.|$|R
