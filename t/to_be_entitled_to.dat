5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right {{to sit in the}} House of Lords.|$|E

25|$|Outside of the United States the {{registration}} process is substantially {{similar to that}} found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding. In short, once an application is reviewed by an examiner and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition {{for a period of}} typically 6 months from the date of registration.|$|E

50|$|Asserting {{that someone}} is a nonperson is implicitly a {{normative}} statement; by doing so, it is implied simultaneously that the person referred <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the rights that any person should have. Who is a person and what every person <b>is</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> depends on context and social norms. For example, wards that are {{under the authority of}} a legal guardian due to infancy, incapacity, or disability are not usually considered nonpersons.|$|R

The King's counsel, objecting to the claim, {{said that there was}} no pillory at Monks Risborough. It is said that the Cadsden Road used to be known as Gallows Lane and the crossing of the Upper Icknield Way with Cadsden Road as Gallows Cross.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{this range}} of glasses, {{the work of}} a team of tasters, {{including}} Jules Chauvet of the INAO in France, led to the creation in 1970 of the INAO glass. This glass has a thin glass wall and curve calculated to be able to taste all wines. This glass is used, among others, during the approval tastings – the gateway for the wines <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> bear the name of an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). This simple but elegant glass {{can also be used to}} serve wine at the table.|$|E

25|$|Having been tipped for a {{possible}} return to the front bench in July 2008, due to her reputation as a solid media performer, Beckett returned to government in the reshuffle on 3 October 2008 as the Minister of State for Housing in the Department for Communities and Local Government. She attended Cabinet meetings, but was not a full member and was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> vote on collective decisions. She ultimately was allowed to come back due to her cabinet experience and her economic management in the past.|$|E
25|$|At their WCA, an ESA {{claimant}} must {{be found}} to have 'limited capability for work' in order to qualify. The testing process gauges the claimant’s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are {{set out on the}} ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant can score 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total.|$|E
25|$|If an MP becomes {{subject to}} any {{disqualification}} specified in paragraph 1, 2, 5 or 7 above {{and it is}} open to the Member to appeal against the decision, the Member immediately ceases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> sit or vote in Parliament or any committee of it. However, he or she is not required to vacate his or her seat until the end of 180 days beginning with the date of the adjudication, declaration or conviction, as the case may be. After that period, the MP must vacate his or her seat if he or she continues to be subject to one of the previously mentioned disqualifications. Otherwise, the MP is entitled to resume sitting or voting in Parliament immediately after ceasing to be disqualified.|$|E

25|$|The Jews of Khaybar finally {{surrendered}} {{after seeing}} {{no way out}} and were allowed {{to live in the}} oasis on the condition that they would give one-half of their produce to the Muslims. Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years until they were expelled by caliph Umar. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the Islamic law requiring the exaction of tribute known as jizya from Dīn under Muslim rule, and confiscation of land belonging to non-Muslims into the collective property of the Muslim community. In return, non-Muslim citizens were permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> Muslim state's protection from outside aggression, and to be exempted from military service and the zakat, which is obligatory upon Muslim citizens.|$|E
25|$|Under the Representation of the People Act 1918, NUI was enfranchised {{as a new}} {{university}} constituency {{and continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> be represented by one Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons until the dissolution of Parliament on 26 October 1922, shortly before the Irish Free State became a dominion outside the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922. In 1918 the electorate included all registered male graduates over 21 (or over 19 if in armed services) and female graduates over 30. There were 3,819 voters registered for the 1918 general election. Most, if not all, of those electors would have been plural voters also entitled to vote in a territorial constituency. The 1918 general election took place on 14 December {{and the results were}} declared on 28 December, except for the university constituencies. NUI voted between 18–22 December and the result was declared on 23 December. Eoin MacNeill was elected (and also for Londonderry City) standing for Sinn Féin and therefore did not take his seat in Westminster, instead serving {{as a member of the}} first Dáil Éireann.|$|E

500|$|The {{amount of}} {{deference}} {{that should be}} given to The Federalist Papers in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial. As early as 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall noted in the famous case McCulloch v. Maryland, that [...] "the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> great respect in expounding the Constitution. No tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained." [...] Madison believed The Federalist Papers were the ideas of the Founders and not just mere expressions. In a letter to Thomas Ritchie in 1821, he stated that [...] "the legitimate meaning of the Instrument must be derived from the text itself; or if a key is to be sought elsewhere, it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the Body which planned & proposed the Constitution, but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective State Conventions where it recd. all the authority which it possesses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dundas was to {{be elected}} in a simple formality, {{returned}} uncontested.

A voter was therefore also brought in for Dundas. Dashwood, acting as the returning officer, rejected the ballot for Jennings, and Dundas was duly elected with one vote.|$|E
