5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters {{and at the same time}} not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} belief that DAB is more {{expensive}} to transmit than FM. It is true that DAB uses higher frequencies than FM and therefore {{there is a need}} to compensate with more transmitters, higher radiated powers, or a combination, to achieve the same coverage. However, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> has seen significant improvement in power efficiency for DAB-transmitters.|$|E
25|$|The Bruins held a 19–11–2 {{record on}} the Wildcats at game time.

25|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} {{has been}} studied in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> In a long case study, 8 patients were given spinal cord stimulation via insertion of a percutaneous lead at the appropriate level of the cervical or thoracic spine. Between 36 and 149 months after the stimulations, the patients were interviewed. 6 of the 8 had received initial pain relief, and three experienced long-term pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation is cheaper than brain stimulation and less invasive, and is thus a more promising option for pain treatment.|$|E

They are back-to-back National Champions in D1-AA and have won a handful of Rugby Sevens tournaments.

25|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> he {{has been}} honing his craft as a record producer, putting out a long array of music {{projects}} along the way. His goal has been to spearhead the EDM movement in Africa {{while at the same}} time doing his part in spreading the gospel of Afro beats music to the rest of the world. Therefore, his mash-ups and remixes infuse both contemporary African rhythms and vocals with the piercing synth sounds of electronic dance music giving birth to a completely new refreshing high. His productions however, though geared towards certain genres still remain highly experimental, reminiscent of early Diplo. His mash-up series “Mash-Up Mondays” where he releases a brand new mash-up every Monday is currently hosted on The Beat 99.9 FM radio station during the Morning Rush show.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{return of}} {{refugees}} into {{their country of}} origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> parts of or even whole refugee populations were {{able to return to}} their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC, 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia. The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were refused asylum.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to her}} high-risk {{game and}} {{aggressive}} style of play she is known to produce {{a high number of}} unforced errors in matches. Movement is another weakness in her game though it has shown significant improvement over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> as she is now able to run down more balls than before. She is known for her inconsistencies, inability to maintain focus on and off during matches as well as impatience mid-rally. Most notably of late, Kvitova has been struggling against defensive players, most notably Agnieszka Radwańska and among others Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep, who prolong points to the extent that Kvitová feels she must hit a winner, thus increasing the chances of producing an unforced error. Against such opponents, she has been shown to break down physically due to her opponent's use of court craft, consistency and patience on court.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Business Directory {{states that}} the Bihar Sugar Industry has flourished in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> due to the efforts taken by the state {{government}} to revive the industry. The Sugar Industry has been helped by the climate of the state, which is very suitable {{for the growth of}} high-grade sugarcane. The main benefit of the industry is that it provides employment to many people, especially in the rural areas. Further, it provides facilities of transport and communication, and also helps {{in the development of the}} rural areas by mobilizing the rural resources. The total number of sugar mills in Bihar Sugar Industry is 28 out which only 9 are operational. The total area under sugarcane production is 2.30 lakh hectares and the total production of sugarcane is around 129.95 lakh M.T. The location of the sugar mills of Bihar Sugar Industry are Samastipur, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, West Champaran, Chorma, Dulipati, and Supaul.|$|E
25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to dropper loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The bait used is normally anything from the surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small soft plastic lures and surface lures like poppes and stick baits imitating a fleeing fish or prawn. this type of fishing has experienced increasing popularity <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E

It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting".|$|E
