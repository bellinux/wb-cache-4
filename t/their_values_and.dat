25|$|That project {{endeavors to}} present all the {{phenomena}} in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute {{a challenge to}} creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the problems that infringe <b>their</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort {{has been made to}} determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that complexity. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.|$|E

Quinn Norton of Wired writes that [...] "Anons lie when they {{have no reason to}} lie. They weave vast fabrications as a form of performance. Then they tell the truth at unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable." [...] Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on the [...] "small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied <b>their</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> crashed violently into the law" [...] rather than [...] "Anonymous’s sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the world".|$|E

University of Wisconsin–Madison {{political science}} professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and {{found that there was}} more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years.

Confucius' social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of ren by every individual in a community. Later Confucian philosophers explained ren as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words [...] "humane", [...] "altruistic", or [...] "benevolent", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses ren in the Analects, very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term ren to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely.

2500|$|Leadership and {{communication}} are constantly growing together, being intertwined {{into one another}} to help develop an organization. To be an effective leader, communication has to be defined in the organization {{for it to be}} successful. Gary Yukl defines leadership as, [...] "the process of influencing others to understand and agree about {{what needs to be done}} and how to do it, and the process of facilitating individual and collective efforts to accomplish shared objectives". To accomplish shared objectives, communication has to be a transactional process that allows for a constant cycle of information to be sent from source/receiver and vice versa. As leaders continue to send and receive information, building relationships with the followers allows for a bond to be made. Through the bond being made it allows for the followers to share <b>their</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> thoughts for example; this gives them a sense of affiliation because the leader is being concerned about his/her employees. Once an organization is able to define leadership {{and communication}}, it can begin to advance to the structure of the organization.|$|E

For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or [...] "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: [...] "l'art du déplacement (French for [...] "the art of movement"). The firefighter performance caused {{both positive and negative}} attention.

Jean-François also sent pictures and video of {{the group to}} a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name [...] "parkour" [...] to describe their activity (see § Etymology above).

2500|$|For Hauerwas, the Niebuhrs are {{important}} figures {{in part because}} the flaws in their thinking represent the same flaws which are endemic to much of modern Christianity, with the Church often being shaped more by the culture of liberal democracy than the message of Jesus. In Hauerwas' view, this has led the Church (and Christians in general) to compromise <b>their</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> place too much faith in secular political ideologies, often leading to a misplaced passion for political power. This represents the thesis of Hauerwas in his most popular book, Resident Aliens (which was co-written by William Willimon). In the book, Hauerwas and Willimon argue that the Church's accommodation to secular culture has led to tragedies like the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima Hauerwas, therefore, believes that the Niebuhrs' thinking is subject to the same flaws as Jerry Falwell, with Hauerwas and Willimon stating that [...] "few books have been a greater hindrance to an accurate assessment of [...] situation" [...] than H. Richard Niebuhr's famous book Christ and Culture. Thus according to Hauerwas, while they may have disagreed when it comes to policy, both the Niebuhrs and Falwell fell prey to the notion Christians have a duty to use the political process as a means to enact [...] "Christian" [...] legislation or pursue justice.|$|E

2500|$|The act {{of being}} genuine {{must come from}} within and be {{expressed}} by nurses without reluctancy. Genuineness requires the psychiatric/mental health nurse to be natural or authentic in their interactions with the patient. In his article about pivotal moments in therapeutic relationships, Welch found that psychiatric nurses must be in accordance with <b>their</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs. Along with the previous concept, O’brien [...] concluded that being consistent and reliable in both punctuality and character makes for genuinity. Schafer and Peternelj-Taylor [...] believe that a psychiatric/mental health nurse's 'genuineness' is determined through the level of consistency displayed between their verbal and non-verbal behavior. Similarly, Scanlon [...] found that genuineness was expressed by fulfilling intended tasks. Self disclosure proves {{to be the key}} to being open and honest. Self-disclosure involves the psychiatric/mental health nurse sharing life experiences. Self-disclosure is also essential to therapeutic relationship development because as the relationship grows patients are reluctant to give any more information if they feel the relationship is too one sided. Multiple authors found genuine emotion, such as tearfulness, blunt feedback, and straight talk facilitated the therapeutic relationship in the pursuit of being open and honest [...] The friendship of a therapeutic relationship is different from a sociable friendship because the therapeutic relationship friendship is asymmetrical in nature. The basic concept of genuineness is centered on being true to one’s word. Patients would not trust nurses who fail in complying with what they say or promise.|$|E

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore <b>their</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor.

In a lengthy interview, Mr Ahern revealed that he and the former DUP leader Dr Ian Paisley bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004 at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Dr Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was [...] "like our Confiteor" [...] and officials had wondered why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing <b>their</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at €128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out €1 billion. As a Catholic, he wanted the church to [...] "do well", but it could not retreat behind canon law, he said. [...] "There was one time when the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked up to the sky and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren’t joking, they made bad decisions." [...] Mr Ahern said he was convinced that life [...] "did not end at the graveyard" [...] and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God cannot influence [...] "every single thing". He said he received a [...] "fair amount of hate mail" [...] about [...] "living in sin", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents’ [...] "stereotype" [...] of married life.|$|E
