5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E

5000|$|Compliant-Tower Rig- The compliant-tower rig is {{very similar}} to the fixed platform. Both are {{anchored}} to the sea floor and both work places are above the surface. However, the compliant tower is <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower,</b> <b>and</b> can operate up to 1 kilometer (3,000 feet) below the surface.|$|R

5000|$|... "On the rocks" [...] {{refers to}} liquor poured over ice cubes, and a [...] "rocks drink" [...] is a drink {{served on the}} rocks. Rocks drinks are {{typically}} served in a rocks glass, highball glass, or Collins glass, all of which refer to a relatively straight-walled, flat-bottomed glass; the rocks glass is typically the shortest and widest, followed by the highball which is <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> often <b>narrower,</b> then the Collins which is <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> still.|$|R
25|$|Meigle 21 is {{a portion}} of a cross slab. It was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> the head of the cross being filled with a {{diagonal}} key pattern while the circle of the head was formed by sculpted ropework. The shaft of the cross is decorated with an interwoven pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Cyrillic typography passed {{directly from the}} medieval stage to the late Baroque, without a Renaissance phase as in Western Europe. Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many icon inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.|$|E
25|$|Life became {{generally}} less secure after the Carolingian period. This {{resulted in the}} building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France under Rollo in 911. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of Carcassonne. The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> often surrounding communal courtyards, as at San Gimignano in Tuscany.|$|E
60|$|He {{watched the}} train slowly pass--still mechanically, almost hopelessly, waving his hat {{as he ran}} up and down before the mesquite, {{as if he were}} waving a last {{farewell}} to his departing hope. Suddenly it appeared to him that three of the outriders who were preceding the first wagon had changed their shape. They were no longer sharp, oblong, black blocks against the horizon but had become at first blurred <b>and</b> indistinct, then <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower,</b> until at last they stood out like exclamation points against the sky. He continued to wave his hat, they continued to grow <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower.</b> He understood it now--the three transformed blocks were the outriders coming towards him.|$|R
25|$|In April 2010, Guinness {{redesigned}} the Guinness pint {{glass for}} the first time in a decade. The new glass is <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> than the previous one and features a bevel design. The new glasses are planned to gradually replace the old ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{changes in}} the {{automobile}} marketplace resulted in Chevrolet redesigning the Impala once again in 1976 to meet changing demands. The new downsized Impalas were shorter in length, <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> than before. The new Impala's frame was a shortened version of the one introduced in 1970 and would be utilized until 1996 when the B-body production line was shut down. Even with its trimmer exterior dimensions, the new Impala featured increased headroom, rear-seat legroom and trunk space. Production of the downsized model increased substantially over 1976, and the Impala regained the number one US sales position. The redesigned 1977 Impala/Caprice was named Motor Trend car of the year. The new body was <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> than the 1976 model.|$|R
25|$|The Romanesque {{period was}} a time of {{frequent}} conflict. Much of Europe was affected by feudalism in which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed in exchange for military service and employment on building projects. This resulted in the building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France in 911. The invasion of England by William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066, saw the building of both castles and abbeys which reinforced the Norman presence. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of Carcassonne. The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> often surrounding communal courtyards, as at San Gimignano in Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{technique}} essential for creating designs that utilize an assortment of materials, the artist must first practice standardized styles. The classic standard Banmi Shofu Ryu designs are Moribana, Nageire, Chabana, Oseika and Gendaika. Ric Bansho also introduced a modern designed called Hashibana which comes in three expressions. These expressions are Maru (Global or spherical), Uate (<b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow)</b> and Saba (low and narrow). Technical points that an artist needs to focus on when creating a design are: {{the length of the}} stems, degrees of slant, intentional space to be used, number of sections in the container, and whether the arrangement will be right or left-sided. Moribana, Nageire Keishatai, Oseika, and Banmi Shofu Chabana are only a few of such designs. Each design has its own characteristics, using particular flowers and specific arrangements styles, which may be appropriate for a certain environment such as a tearoom. The balance of the plants and flowers, combined with the appropriate container and spirit of the materials, creates a beautiful composition, which incorporates the naturalness of each design.|$|E
500|$|Cauchy used an infinitesimal α {{to write}} down a unit impulse, {{infinitely}} <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> Dirac-type delta function δα satisfying [...] {{in a number of}} articles in 1827. Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in Cours d'Analyse (1827) in terms of a sequence tending to zero. [...] Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and Lazare Carnot's terminology.|$|E
50|$|From 1876, Godwin {{designed}} {{houses for}} the new garden suburb of Bedford Park, Chiswick. His designs were thought poor, as they had steep staircases, a toilet in the bathroom, relatively small rooms, <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> corridors. Only {{a few of his}} houses were built; they are <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> than those built by other architects.|$|R

These are made from white plastic with cork or pith interior lining and resemble the British Custodian helmet, though <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower.</b>|$|R
50|$|Juglans regia is a large, {{deciduous}} tree attaining {{heights of}} 25-35 m (80 to 120 ft), and a trunk up to 2 m (6 ft) diameter, commonly {{with a short}} trunk and broad crown, though <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> in dense forest competition. It is a light-demanding species, requiring full sun to grow well.|$|R
500|$|The {{painting}} was widely copied and imitated during the 15thcentury. Near-contemporary copper reproductions are known from Bergamo and Turin. Petrus Christus borrowed the illusionistic carving on the parapet for his 1446 Portrait of a Carthusian. A [...] 1449–1450 portrait of Marco Barbarigo {{attributed to a}} follower of vanEyck is also heavily indebted to Léal Souvenir {{in that it is}} also unusually <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> with a large space above the sitter's head.|$|E
500|$|Batrachotomus had a <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> skull {{estimated}} at [...] in length. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), {{two pairs of}} which were for the eyes (called orbits) and the nostrils. Behind the orbits were two temporal fenestrae. These holes probably helped to reduce {{the weight of the}} skull and enabled the jaw to open more widely. As a typical archosaur, Batrachotomus had two antorbital fenestrae between the orbits and nostrils, and a fifth pair of small openings at the rear part of the lower jaw.|$|E

50|$|Further renovations {{are planned}} for the Library West colonnade, and the dates for its {{construction}} are yet to be determined. The new design would create a <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> colonnade to replace the existing one, and add several features that would promote more space for students, including the installation of tables and benches. A bronze statue of an alligator will also {{be located in the}} center of the new colonnade after construction ceases.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle Instability: An {{unstable}} vehicle may {{be subject}} to rollover accidents. During the 1990s and early 2000s, there were a large number of accidents that involved vehicle's rolling over. This type of issue led to a product liability claims against a number of SUV models, which had a higher-than-normal center of gravity. Because they are <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower,</b> SUVs, or sports utility vehicles, are {{three times more likely to}} roll over in an accident than are other passenger cars.|$|R
2500|$|Though Prospero's castle {{is meant}} to keep the {{sickness}} out, it is ultimately an oppressive structure. Its maze-like design and <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> windows become almost burlesque in the final black room, so oppressive that [...] "there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all". Additionally, the castle {{is meant to}} be an enclosed space, yet the stranger is able to sneak inside, suggesting that control is an illusion.|$|E
2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow.</b> [...] Captain Scott was so proud of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight deep in her hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making her a little less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least the hint of a list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E
2500|$|William Turpel, {{owner of}} a marine railway in Victoria, testified that his company had hauled Sechelt {{out of the water}} on March 14, 1911 to repair her propeller, which, because one blade had been lost, the {{opposite}} blade had to be removed to keep the shaft in balance. In his opinion, without plenty of ballast, the boat was too <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> to be a good sea boat. Harold G. Jarvis, her surviving owner testified to the contrary, that he felt, as an experienced seaman, that Sechelt was perfectly suitable for the Victoria-Sooke run and that when he and Captain James had inspected her when she was hauled out at Turpel's yard, they both found her to be in [...] "first-class" [...] condition. He did not consider the vessel top-heavy, and stated she had made several trips just before her loss in worse weather conditions, which on the 24th he characterized as [...] "fresh" [...] but not a gale. He said that on March 24, 1911, he had been aboard the vessel before she sailed. All the cargo was stowed as low as possible on the main deck, and no cargo was carried on the upper deck, nor did they ever carry cargo on the upper deck. He could not give an opinion as to the cause of the loss of the vessel, but thought it must have been due to a sudden accident or mechanical problem which caused her to veer out of control broadside to the wind.|$|E

30|$|An {{investigation}} {{compared the}} Sudanese female (SF) face {{with those of}} African Americans (AA) and North American whites (NAW) and recognized differences, expressing that the neoclassical norms were unreliable guides to the SF face as they were considerably <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower</b> than the AA or NAW female face respectively [11]. Another investigation recognized that the typical AA female does not fit the neoclassical criterion of facial proportions, and varied considerably in the horizontal dimension measurements when compared to those of white subjects [17].|$|R
50|$|For a given {{sail area}} a gaff rig has a shorter mast than a {{bermudian}} rig. In short-ended craft with full body, heavy displacement and moderate ballast ratio, {{it is difficult}} to set enough sail area in the bermudian rig without a mast of excessive height and a center of effort (CE) too high for the limited stability of the hull. Because of its low aspect ratio, the gaff rig is less prone to stalling if oversheeted than something <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrower.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The sacristan {{opened a}} <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> little recess {{in the wall}} of the chancel, and showed it entirely filled with the crosier of William of Wickham.

Modern art cannot, or does not, equal the chasing and carving of this splendid crosier, which is enriched with figures of saints and, apostles, and various Gothic devices,--very minute, but all executed as faithfully as if the artist's salvation had depended upon every notch he made in the silver.

60|$|So the two {{men began}} to {{struggle}} together. They were very dissimilar. Birkin was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> his bones were very thin and fine. Gerald was much heavier and more plastic. His bones were strong and round, his limbs were rounded, all his contours were beautifully and fully moulded. He seemed to stand with a proper, rich weight {{on the face of}} the earth, whilst Birkin seemed to have the centre of gravitation in his own middle. And Gerald had a rich, frictional kind of strength, rather mechanical, but sudden and invincible, whereas Birkin was abstract as to be almost intangible. He impinged invisibly upon the other man, scarcely seeming to touch him, like a garment, and then suddenly piercing in a tense fine grip that seemed to penetrate into the very quick of Gerald's being.|$|E
60|$|Kirk Alloway is inconceivably small, {{considering}} how large a space it fills in our imagination before we see it. I paced its length, {{outside of the}} wall, and found it only seventeen of my paces, and not more than ten of them in breadth. There {{seem to have been}} but very few windows, all of which, if I rightly remember, are now blocked up with mason-work of stone. One mullioned window, <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> in the eastern gable, might have been seen by Tam O'Shanter, blazing with devilish light, as he approached along the road from Ayr; and there is a small and square one, on the side nearest the road, into which he might have peered, as he sat on horseback. Indeed, I could easily have looked through it, standing on the ground, had not the opening been walled up. There is an odd kind of belfry at the peak of one of the gables, with the small bell still hanging in it. And this is all that I remember of Kirk Alloway, except that the stones of its material are gray and irregular.|$|E
