5|$|According {{to video}} of the police interview, Green {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> had a normal day before the fire. The children went to school and performed their chores before attending various after-school activities—Kate went to her dance class, Tim to a hockey game. Farrar had taken Tim and Kelly to the hockey game, while Green took Kate to ballet lessons. The family regrouped around 9 p.m. when Tim and Kelly were dropped back at the Prairie Village house for dinner.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} Alder {{developed}} {{interest in his}} original family in Virginia. A companion, John Moore, learned that Alder had been taken prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family. Initial inquiries were unsuccessful, but {{one of a series}} of advertisements Moore placed in the district was seen by Alder's surviving brother Paul. Paul then wrote Jonathan to inform him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> was still alive.|$|E

5|$|Blythe also {{alleged that}} after {{learning}} about Nosek's death, {{he had written}} {{a letter to the}} Nosek family, in which he offered help and a meeting in-person. Daniel Nosek's father, however, testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. Nosek's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The Nosek family's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (approx. US$530,000).|$|E
5|$|It passed {{onto his}} younger brother, George, who entertained Queen Anne and Prince Henry there in 1603, and onto George's grandson, Henry, who hosted James I three times between 1612 and 1617, and Charles I in 1634. The gardens were redeveloped, {{probably}} {{to provide a}} suitable venue for these royal visits. By now, however, several generations of excessive expenditure meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> estates had been much diminished, and the family was having trouble maintaining their lavish lifestyle and former prominence in the region.|$|E
5|$|John did {{not attend}} his parents' {{coronation}} on 22 June 1911, as this was considered too risky for his health; nonetheless, cynics said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> feared their reputation would be damaged by any incident involving him.|$|E

5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, then under Egyptian control. Melman writes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, the cremated {{remains of}} Terri Schiavo were buried.

5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> {{did not wish to}} divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E

5|$|The name Bruce Castle {{is derived}} from the House of Bruce, who had {{historically}} owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> lived nearby. Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{suggested}} {{that all three}} were brothers, John the first-born, William the second-born, and Walter {{the youngest of the}} three. He further suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> was probably closely connected to Margaret de Abernethy, heiress of the old lay abbots and lords of Abernethy. Margaret had patronage over both the church of Abernethy and, as probable owner of the barony of Inverarity, the church there.|$|E
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E

5|$|Angie takes {{a job at}} the {{catering}} {{company of}} her neighbor, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross), and a friendship develops. Later, Angie learns that Nick had an affair with Julie prior to her attack, but she forgives him for this betrayal. When Julie rejects Danny once more, he attempts suicide by swallowing a large amount of pills. Angie and Nick admit him to the hospital, where he awakens with temporary memory loss and tells Nurse Mona Clark (Maria Cominis), that his name is Tyler. Mona assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> is in the witness relocation program, but Danny fully reveals his family's secret. Mona demands $67,000 from the Bolens in return for her silence but is killed by a plane that makes an emergency landing on Wisteria Lane soon after.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had to buy back their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, {{but it was not}} until the reign of Charles I <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> fully regained their properties.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
