5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price. The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers, which led to fears from residents that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner. In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price. The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E

5|$|The panels were {{included}} in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 Annunciation. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer M. Knoedler & Company for $185,000, significantly less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931. The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.|$|E
5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although {{it is possible that the}} original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E

Positivity of expectations under test probabilities renders <b>the</b> best <b>ask</b> price to be the supremum of expectations across test probabilities. <b>The</b> <b>ask</b> price is then a convex function on the space of random cash flows and, by construction, <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> exceeds <b>the</b> bid.

25|$|According {{to recent}} scholarship, the {{painting}} was first owned by Francesco Pisani, and housed at the Palazzo Pisani in Montagnana, a building designed by Palladio. The canvas was probably moved to Venice after 1629, when the Pisani family purchased a palace on the Grand Canal. It was so esteemed that in 1664 agents of Christina, Queen of Sweden attempted to negotiate its purchase with the Venetian ambassador to Rome. <b>The</b> <b>asking</b> price of 5,000 ducats was considered excessive, and effectively discouraged all prospective buyers.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} modeling of frequency coded serial communication {{for the application}} of Eurobalise on hardware-based field programmable gate array (FPGA). The transceiver consists of FPGA and the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band amplitude shift keying (<b>ASK)</b> module. In <b>the</b> convention interface of <b>the</b> <b>ASK</b> transceiver module with the digital controller, noise has introduce into the channel. The noise in <b>the</b> output of <b>ASK</b> receiver has distorted the transmitted data causing the throughput of the wireless channel to be decreased. When <b>the</b> <b>ASK</b> module interfaces with the FPGA device, the noise from the output of <b>the</b> <b>ASK</b> receiver causing <b>the</b> receiving FPGA retarded. The purpose of the frequency coded serial data is to provide continuous specific frequency pulse train to <b>the</b> <b>ASK</b> transmitter. <b>The</b> original serial bit stream is then modulated in the pulse train with different frequency corresponding to the bit’s logic level. This technique has made the output of <b>the</b> <b>ASK</b> receiver to produce a very clean signal with extremely less noise. Hence, the receiver’s FPGA able to capture all the transmitted data accurately across traditional disciplinary boundaries, including computer hardware, algorithms, electronics interfacing and application domain...|$|R
