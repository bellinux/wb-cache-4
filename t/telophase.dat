25|$|Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, {{which are}} {{synthesized}} but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote {{the initiation of}} mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that <b>telophase</b> and cytokinesis can proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is complex and}} highly regulated. The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and <b>telophase.</b> During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{completion of}} cytokinesis are still poorly understood. Here, {{we show that}} the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian Citron kinases {{is essential for the}} final events of the cytokinetic process. Flies bearing mutations in the Drosophila citron kinase (dck) gene were defective in both neuroblast and spermatocyte cytokinesis. In both cell types, early cytokinetic events such as central spindle assembly and contractile ring formation were completely normal. Moreover, cytokinetic rings constricted normally, leading to complete furrow ingression. However late <b>telophases</b> of both cell types displayed persistent midbodies associated with disorganized F actin and anillin structures. Similar defects were observed in dck RNA interference (RNAi) <b>telophases,</b> which, in addition to abnormal F actin and anillin rings, also displayed aberrant membrane protrusions at the cleavage site. Together, these results indicate that mutations in the dck gene result in morphologically abnormal intercellular bridges and in delayed resolution of these structures, suggesting that the wild-type function of dck is required for abscission at the end of cytokinesis. The phenotype of Dck-depleted cells is different from those observed in most Drosophila cytokinesis mutants but extraordinarily similar to that caused by anillin RNAi, suggesting that Dck and anillin are in the same pathway for completion of cytokinesis...|$|R

This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for <b>telophase.</b> During <b>telophase,</b> when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.|$|E

Adult grasshoppers were treated with 28 μl of the Ethanol extract of sun dry seeds of Annona muricata and absolute ethanol (control) for 48 hours and all the parameters (chiasma frequency, formation of rod and ring shaped bivalents and meiotic anomalies) were affected by the extract. Chiasma formation was observed to significantly (P< 0. 05) increase following treatment and this was correlated by {{a significant increase in}} the formation of ring shaped bivalents. The incidences of meiotic anomalies such as laggards and bridges at first and second meiotic Anaphases, second meiotic Metaphase as well as in first and second meiotic <b>Telophases</b> were observed to increase when insects were treated with the ethanol extract.

50|$|Investigating {{the tissue}} {{distribution}} of the citron isoforms with and without the kinase domain, {{it has been shown}} that the non-kinase form is restricted to the brain region while the kinase form is widely expressed. Immunofluorescence analyses determined the localization of citron-K and its behavior during cytokinesis. Citron-K first appeared at the equatorial cortex in anaphase, concentrated at the cleavage furrow in early <b>telophase,</b> accumulated in the middle of the intercellular bridge with full ingression of the cleavage furrow in mid <b>telophase,</b> and formed a ring-like structure in the midbody in late <b>telophase,</b> with negligible turnover rate at the midbody. In other words, the protein is much less dynamic at the midbody. Using a series of deletions, it was observed that distinct regions of Citron-K CC (coiled- coil) domain differentially regulate the localizations of Citron-K during cytokinesis. The C terminal part of the CC domain localized at the cleavage furrow and the midbody while the N-terminal part of the CC domain localized at the central spindle in early <b>telophase</b> and on outer region of the midbody in late <b>telophase.</b>|$|E

40|$|SummaryPhosphatidylinositol {{transfer}} proteins (PITPs) {{are highly}} conserved polypeptides that bind phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine monomers, facilitating their transfer from one membrane compartment to another [1]. Although PITPs have {{been implicated in}} a variety of cellular functions, including lipid-mediated signaling and membrane trafficking, the precise biological roles of most PITPs remain to be elucidated [1, 2]. Here we show {{for the first time that}} a class I PITP is involved in cytokinesis. We found that giotto (gio), a Drosophila gene that encodes a class I PITP, serves an essential function required for both mitotic and meiotic cytokinesis. Neuroblasts and spermatocytes from gio mutants both assemble regular actomyosin rings. However, these rings fail to constrict to completion, leading to cytokinesis failures. Moreover, gio mutations cause an abnormal accumulation of Golgi-derived vesicles at the equator of spermatocyte <b>telophases,</b> suggesting that Gio is implicated in membrane-vesicle fusion. Consistent with these results, we found that Gio is enriched at the cleavage furrow, the ER, and the spindle envelope. We propose that Gio mediates transfer of lipid monomers from the ER to the equatorial membrane, causing a specific local enrichment in phosphatidylinositol. This change in membrane composition would ultimately facilitate vesicle fusion, allowing membrane addition to the furrow and/or targeted delivery of proteins required for cytokinesis...|$|R

The slides were prepared by squashing and staining with 1 % propionic carmine. Results showed that during microsporogenesis there were few irregularities, mostly frequently related to chromosome irregular segregation as: precocious migration to poles in metaphase I and II, non-oriented bivalent chromosomes at metaphase I and II, and laggard chromosomes in anaphase I and II, forming micronuclei in <b>telophases</b> I and II and tetrad with microcyte. Another observed irregularity is related to the organization of spindle fibers in meiosis II as they organize themselves in T and V shapes and in sequential spindle. However, in the V-shaped spindle configuration, there was fusion between two nuclei that were close, forming triads instead of tetrads. Irregular chromosome segregation, abnormal spindles and irregularities in the cytokinesis process were responsible for the formation of monads, dyads, triads and polyads. However, the pollen grain viability was not harmed, presenting an 83. 98 % to 98. 59 % fertility variation...|$|R

The female genitors were two artificially tetraploidized sexual accessions of B. ruziziensis (R 41 and R 44, 2 n = 4 &# 967; = 36), which were crossed to an agronomically superior natural tetraploid apomictic genotype of B. brizantha (B 140 - BRA 003395). Three of them (HBGC 313, HBGC 315, and HBGC 324) were sexual and one (HBGC 325) apomictic. Analyses of some cells in diakinesis revealed multivalent chromosome configurations, suggesting that genetic recombination and introgression of some genes could be present. The four hybrids had {{different types of}} meiotic abnormalities at various frequencies. Abnormalities related to irregular chromosome segregation due to polyploidy were common among these hybrids, and characterized by precocious chromosome migration to the poles, laggard chromosomes, both generating micronuclei in <b>telophases</b> and tetrads and, as a consequence, unbalanced gametes. One abnormality genotype-specific, related to spindle orientation (a putative divergent spindle mutation), was recorded {{for the first time}} in two of the hybrids, HBGC 313 and HBGC 325. The sexual hybrid HBGC 324 had the lower rate of abnormalities, and it could be used as a female genitor in future crosses in the breeding program.
