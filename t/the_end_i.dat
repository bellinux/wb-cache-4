5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

25|$|My {{father was}} heartbroken, and I saw him {{physically}} and mentally broken by the ordeal. He fought back {{with the help of}} my mother and recovered his strength, confidence, and pride before he {{died of a heart attack}} five years later. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> think he found comfort in knowing that what he did saved some airmen's lives, and that was worth more to him than four stars.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{wrote of}} his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan {{in a letter}} to Franz Liszt (December 16, 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true {{happiness}} of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the ‘black flag’ that waves at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> shall cover myself over – to die.|$|E
500|$|Kristoff {{was delighted}} with his win, saying: [...] "I'm really happy to win, it's {{a really good}} feeling [...] My family is here today, {{and it was a}} big dream and my big goal this season and I managed to do it." [...] On his run-in to the finish line with Terpstra, he commented: [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> came with Niki, and he didn't really want to work with me, but I {{understand}} that. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> could still beat him." [...] Geraint Thomas was disappointed with his performance, tweeting after the race that he [...] "just lacked the legs of last weekend", referring to his E3 Harelbeke victory.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{stated that}} [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> think it worked, but it's getting there that's really difficult."

500|$|... "I {{changed my}} mind twice on what [...] was. The working title had got out— Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. Then I changed Doomspell to Triwizard Tournament. Then I was teetering between Goblet of Fire and Triwizard Tournament.

500|$|In 1993, {{while doing}} press tours for his album Black Tie White Noise, Bowie {{acknowledged}} that, while the album {{sold more than}} any of his previous albums (except Let's Dance), he felt that while making it he had almost lost his interest in making music altogether. He elaborated, [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> didn't lose the songs, but I lost the sound. ... I literally threw them away by giving them to very good people to arrange but not being involved myself, {{almost to the point of}} indifference." ...|$|E
500|$|During the fight, Mann {{was able}} to land several {{successful}} punches, before Hioki took Mann down with a trip, where he {{was able to}} land knees and execute a D'arce choke. After scrambling to avoid an armbar attempt, Mann fell to a triangle choke, tapping out at 3:09 of the first round. After the fight, Mann stated [...] "I started off well, standing up, but I fell into his game. Fell into his trap. The punches were only small punches, but it was the triangle that was slowly coming on, so in <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> tapped." ...|$|E
500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I {{think it would be}} a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and when I got to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> wrote mine." ...|$|E

500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various {{reasons for his}} disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then {{chairman}} of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin {{to try to persuade}} wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become [...] "burnt out" [...] and said, [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> felt I might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{turned into}} a raving maniac and insisted that he get Aaron on the phone as soon as possible.

The {{inference}} was that she would make do. But not me!... I screamed at Aaron that bugger Cartiers, I was going to get that diamond if it cost me my life or 2 million dollars whichever was the greater. For 24 hours the agony persisted and in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> won. I got the bloody thing".|$|E

500|$|He also said, [...] "I {{was pretty}} much left alone for two days, and I let [...] in at <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>I</b> played her [...] song by song, and she'd burst into tears. 'Oh! It's so beautiful!', 'Oh, it's so beautiful!' You know, {{this is the same}} stuff that people tell me, 'Oh! It's so suicidal!'" [...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal".|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were very {{emotional}} during filming, as they were concerned {{that this might be}} the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one. [...] Olmos helped to work up the cast's emotions for the shoot by telling everyone that the show was ending. [...] According to co-writer Weddle, Olmos repeatedly told the cast, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> think we all feel that. [...] They're not going to bring the show back. [...] They'll pull the sets down. [...] We'll never shoot another episode." [...] Actress Kandyse McClure improvised the lullaby her character hums before committing suicide, and series composer Bear McCreary used the melody for part of the episode's musical soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
