5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E

Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{suggests}} that acting on anger reduces {{the need for}} vengeance, which may {{be connected to the}} British view of anger held following the start of the French Revolution. The revolutionary forces were commonly connected to the expression of anger with opposing sides arguing that the anger was either a motivating rationale or simply blinded an individual to reason. Blake, like Coleridge, believed <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> needed to be expressed, but both were wary of the type of emotion that, rather than guide, was able to seize control.|$|E

The Alliance combined extreme anti-communism with a pursuit of accelerated neoliberal economic reforms.|$|E

500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> when I realized that I never {{had to worry about}} work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals that he was an alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek series—something that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E
2500|$|Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s {{have contributed}} {{to many of the}} recent ideas on the {{management}} of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at the situations that led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> is an emotional response to situations, and <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral. [...] After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify the situations that lead to anger and deal with the anger depending on the step that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.|$|E

My daughter’s the most beautiful one!” Petrelis said of the legend, “...of course, I wasn’t there, and you don’t necessarily inherit that kind of whatever it takes to do it, but sometimes, you’ve just got to overturn some tables and remember that, for me, I have a Mediterranean background and <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> is okay.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In the October 26, 1967 {{issue of}} Village Voice, Anger {{publicly}} reinvented himself {{by placing a}} full-page advert declaring [...] "In Memoriam. Kenneth Anger. Filmmaker 1947–1967". He soon publicly reappeared, this time to claim that he had burned all of his early work. The following year he travelled to London where he first met John Paul Getty, Jr., who became Anger's patron, and where he also met and befriended Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, members of The Rolling Stones, as well as actress/model Anita Pallenberg. Anger then decided to use much of the footage created for Lucifer Rising in a new film of his, Invocation of My Demon Brother, which starred Beausoleil, LaVey, Jagger and Richards, as well as Anger himself, and the music for which had been composed by Jagger. It was released in 1969, and explored many of the Thelemic themes <b>that</b> <b>Anger</b> had originally intended for Lucifer Rising. The story of the film, its making, and the people involved are {{the inspiration for the}} novel Sway, by Zachary Lazar.|$|E
2500|$|Colliers {{had little}} {{opportunity}} to air their grievances. Many colliers resided in company towns, {{in which all}} land, real estate, and amenities were owned by the mine operator, and which were expressly designed to inculcate loyalty and squelch dissent. Welfare capitalists believed <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> and unrest among the workers could be placated by raising colliers' standard of living, while subsuming it under company management. Company towns indeed brought tangible improvements {{to the lives of}} many colliers and their families, including larger houses, better medical care, and broader access to education. However, ownership of the towns provided companies considerable control over all aspects of workers' lives, and this power was not always used to augment public welfare. Historian Philip S. Foner has described company towns as [...] "feudal domain, with the company acting as lord and master. ... The 'law' consisted of the company rules. Curfews were imposed. Company guards - brutal thugs armed with machine guns and rifles loaded with soft-point bullets - would not admit any 'suspicious' stranger into the camp and would not permit any miner to leave." [...] Furthermore, miners who raised the ire of the company were liable to find themselves and their families summarily evicted from their homes.|$|E
2500|$|Tracing {{its origins}} in South Africa, the youth embraced hip hop and its culture from the United States {{including}} its break dancing and graffiti aspects. These styles of expression were the predecessors to involvement in the music, due to the high cost and difficulty in finding music. Economic and political sanctions made finding American music extremely difficult. U.S. hip hop albums were seldom imported, but rather sent by relatives outside the country. The audience was not totally approving however. Many were {{not happy with the}} links US hip hop had to the [...] "structures that were largely responsible for the devastating conditions in the Third World countries." [...] The young people took hip hop and it's anger, passion, and style in order to express themselves. They localized the music to express culture, frustration, and hope in order to tell their own stories. The older population used <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> and passion to pass messages against the occurring apartheid, and also to connect with the youth. The music was perfect for the time because it was able to take the language of the underprivileged, parade it, and make it attractive to the point where people took pride in their style of music.|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of <b>that</b> <b>anger</b> was directed at Koreans.|$|E
2500|$|The mid-1960s saw the {{emergence}} of the hippie scene and the increasing use of the mind-altering drugs <b>that</b> <b>Anger</b> himself had been using for many years. In particular, the hallucinogen LSD, which at the time was still legal in the United States, was very popular, and in 1966 Anger released a version of his earlier film, Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome titled the [...] "Sacred Mushroom Edition" [...] which was screened to people while taking LSD, thereby heightening their sensory experience. By this time, Anger had become well known throughout the underground scene in the United States, and several cinemas across the country screened his better known films all in one event. With this growing fame, Anger began to react to publicity {{in much the same way}} as his idol Aleister Crowley had done, for instance describing himself as [...] "the most monstrous moviemaker in the underground", a pun on the fact that Crowley had been labelled [...] "the wickedest man in the world" [...] by the British tabloids in the 1920s. Anger's fame on the underground circuit allowed him to increasingly associate with other celebrities, including Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan who named Anger as godfather to Zeena Schreck (LaVey's daughter). Despite Anger and LaVey's differing philosophies, the two became good friends and would remain so for many years. However, Anger also held a resentment towards certain celebrities, namely Andy Warhol, who at the time was achieving success not only in the art world but also in the underground film scene. In 1980 Anger threw paint over the front door of a house that Warhol had recently moved out of.|$|E
