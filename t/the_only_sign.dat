5|$|Bosa {{appears as}} a saint in an 8th-century liturgical {{calendar}} from York, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> that he was venerated as a saint before the Norman Conquest of England. The 16th-century English antiquary John Leland included Bosa in his list of saint's resting places in England, giving it as York. Bosa's feast day is 9 March.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{animals are}} represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (weta) and snails. Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique {{that they have been}} called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old. Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters. Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country. More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{dystonia}} {{is suspected}} when the dystonia is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> {{and there is}} no identifiable cause or structural abnormality in the central nervous system. It is suspected to be caused by a pathology of the central nervous system, likely originating in those parts of the brain concerned with motor function, such as the basal ganglia, and the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) producing Purkinje neurons. The precise cause of primary dystonia is unknown. In many cases it may involve some genetic predisposition towards the disorder combined with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that person. Because the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E

500|$|Despite Tolkien's {{statements}} in The Hobbit that Elves (and Hobbits) have no beards, Círdan in fact has a beard, {{which appears to}} be an anomaly and a simple oversight. However, Tolkien later devised at least [...] three [...] "cycles of life" [...] for Elves around 1960; Círdan had a beard because he was in his third cycle of life. (Mahtan, Nerdanel's father, had a beard in his second cycle of life, a rare phenomenon.) [...] It is unclear what these cycles exactly are, since Tolkien left no notes further explaining this. Apparently, beards were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of further natural physical ageing beyond maturity.|$|E
500|$|It is also {{possible}} that the mound is actually a cenotaph rather than a grave, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of body was a chemical stain which could have had other origins, indeed the site includes burials of both meat and companion animals. [...] Further {{there is a lack of}} shroud ties, and no clear evidence of items which might have adorned a body being left in the expected places in relation to the stain. [...] The cenotaph theory may be consistent with the transition from pagan burial to Christian burial, certainly as far as Rædwald is concerned, he could have received a Christian burial, and the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia.|$|E
500|$|The {{group from}} Bonnie Brae Street {{eventually}} discovered an available building at 312 Azusa Street in downtown Los Angeles, which {{had originally been}} constructed as an African Methodist Episcopal Church {{in what was then}} an impoverished part of town. The rent was $8.00 per month. A newspaper referred to the downtown Los Angeles building as a [...] "tumble down shack". Since the church had moved out, the building had served as a wholesale house, a warehouse, a lumberyard, stockyards, a tombstone shop, and had most recently been used as a stable with rooms for rent upstairs. It was a small, rectangular, flat-roofed building, approximately [...] long and [...] wide, totaling , sided with weathered whitewashed clapboards. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> that it had once been a house of God was a single Gothic-style window over the main entrance.|$|E

500|$|At both {{of those}} rugged, mountainous sites, salvage efforts removed the more {{accessible}} and valuable wreckage, but scattered and sometimes substantial portions of the TWA DC-3 and Bonanza Air Lines Fairchild F-27 were left behind, including the DC-3's radial engines. The United Airlines DC-7 crash site, however, has been cleared of all but the smallest artifacts, and is threatened by development. In 1958 the site {{was at least a}} mile from the nearest paved road; today the spot where the DC-7 hit is adjacent to a developed neighborhood near the intersection of Decatur Boulevard and Cactus Avenue. [...] Five decades after the events of April 21, 1958, a small makeshift marker placed in the sandy soil was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of the loss of United Airlines Flight 736, but preliminary efforts were in motion to encourage public officials to build a permanent memorial to those who died.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} shows Eakins {{and five}} friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each {{of the men}} {{is looking at the}} water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, [...] "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c.1865– c.1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c.1880–90), George Reynolds (c.1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.|$|E
500|$|According to the Gesta Hungarorum, [...] "a great host of Muslims" [...] {{arrived in}} Hungary [...] "from {{the land of}} Bular" [...] under Taksony. The {{contemporaneous}} Abraham ben Jacob also recorded the presence of Muslim merchants from Hungary in Prague in 965. Anonymous also writes of the arrival of Pechenegs during Taksony's reign; he granted them [...] "a land to dwell {{in the region of}} Kemej as far as the Tisza". <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> of a Hungarian connection with Western Europe under Taksony is a report by Liudprand of Cremona. He writes about Zacheus, whom Pope John XII consecrated bishop and [...] "sent to the Hungarians in order to preach that they should attack" [...] the Germans in 963. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Zacheus ever arrived in Hungary. Taksony arranged the marriage of his elder son Géza to Sarolt, daughter of Gyula of Transylvania, before his death during the early 970s.|$|E

2500|$|In An Archive of Feelings, Cvetkovich {{argues for}} a wider view of trauma that moves beyond those who {{experience}} it directly by also {{taking into consideration}} its everyday and cultural effects. She states, “I am interested not just in trauma survivors but in those whose experiences circulate {{in the vicinity of}} trauma and are marked by it. I want to place moments of extreme trauma alongside moments of everyday emotional distress that are often <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sign</b> that trauma's effects are still being felt.” Furthermore, Cvetkovich not only sexualizes and queers trauma in her book, but she also critiques the pathologization of trauma and argues for a broader understanding of therapy. She breaks the binary “often animated in trauma studies scholarship between acting out (frequently pathologized or designated unhealthy) and working through (often viewed as psychologically positive).” Cvetkovich suggests that the public cultures formed around trauma – trauma cultures – can have therapeutic effects. Collapsing the boundary between privatized emotion and the public and political, “affective life can be seen to pervade public life.” ...|$|E
