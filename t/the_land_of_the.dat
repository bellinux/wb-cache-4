5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim {{to make their way}} to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living.|$|E

5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Following on from Tintin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France.

5|$|Literary critic Ioana Pârvulescu {{agreed that}} there was a link between Mitică and other {{characters}} in Caragiale's sketches; she subsequently argued that formed {{an integral part of the}} writer's caricature of Romania in its entirety, and that the measure to which they reflected reality is impossible to detect. In her 2007 volume of essays, titled În Ţara Miticilor. De şapte ori Caragiale ("In <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mitici.
