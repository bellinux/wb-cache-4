40|$|Scheduling {{trains in}} a railway network is a {{fundamental}} operational problem in the railway industry. A local feedback-based <b>travel</b> <b>advance</b> strategy is developed using a discrete event model of train advances along lines of the railway. This approach can quickly handle perturbations in the schedule and is shown to perform well on three time-performance criteria while maintaining the local nature of the strategy. If the local strategy leads to a deadlock, a capacity check algorithm is applied that prevents deadlock, but requires additional nonlocal information. Extensions to the strategy are developed for networks with double-track sections and with variable train characteristics and priorities. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved simulation method for solving the train scheduling problem {{to reduce the}} total travel time on the single-track railway. An algorithm based on the global information of the train is designed to obtain a more effective <b>travel</b> <b>advance</b> strategy of the train than the TAS method proposed by Dorfman and Medanic [Dorfman, M. J., Medanic, J., 2004. Scheduling trains on a railway network using a discrete-event model of railway traffic. Transportation Research Part B 38 (1), 81 - 98]. Based on the non-local information, we present a train control method with more loose restrains to avoid the deadlock. Moreover, operation conditions of trains under the local information are analyzed in detail, and the improved method can describe the behaviors of acceleration and deceleration of trains. The simulation {{results show that the}} total delay time of trains decreases remarkably. This fact means that the improved method can obtain a better schedule than the method proposed by Dorfman and Medanic (2004). Compared with the mathematical programming method, our method has a better computational performance, and can quickly obtain a good feasible meet-pass plan. The approach described in this paper is designed to be a decision support tool for train dispatchers to schedule the trains in real-time. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{additional}} help document is to clarify the financial aspects Office of Civilian Response (OCR) travel advances. Background The Office of Civilian Response (OCR) was created within USAID/DCHA to coordinate USAID's Agency-wide efforts to "assist foreign states and regions at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife. " USAID is one of nine civilian US Government Agencies tasked with providing these services worldwide. OCR both supports and manages these inter-agency deployments around the globe. This support includes both the rapid deployment of the Civilian Response Corps (CRC) as well as logistical and financial management support. Many of these deployments are to regions where direct support from either an existing in-country USAID Mission or U. S. Embassy is limited and where our deployed personnel operate in cash economies where neither credit cards, travelers checks nor banking services are available. In a typical scenario, CRC personnel will be deployed to an area experiencing civil strife or another situation that has undermined host country government operations or effectiveness. Travel authorizations will be created in Washington, and CRC personnel {{will be brought to}} Washington for training and preparation. Upon departure from Washington, these employees are issued a cash <b>travel</b> <b>advance.</b> Subsequent advances may be issued by the supporting Mission, Embassy or M/CFO/CMP. Frequently, cashier support is difficult to provide and does not consistently deliver the required amounts of cash to the deployed personnel. The availability of transportation varies and the employee has to journey long distances, sometimes across international borders, to file a travel voucher and request an advance to replenish their cash. Where personnel are operating under such conditions, the following procedures are being implemented to minimize the amount of time the employee is taken away from the job, to establish safeguards to minimize the risk of loss or theft of the USG funds, and to further the accomplishment of the USAID mission...|$|E
