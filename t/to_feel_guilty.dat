Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman.

It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide.

[...] Hua Hsu of Blender magazine made a similar comparison, proclaiming Annie the [...] "Kylie Minogue hipsters don't have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> about liking".

500|$|The town {{is shaken}} by the crime, which causes Bart <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> about his actions. Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer told him.

500|$|As such, the FCC representatives {{start to}} censor any foul {{language}} and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining their times of privacy; for instance, a black [...] "censor's bar" [...] is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees {{as he leaves}} the shower, all expletives are overdubbed with an air horn, and audible farts are banned in public (replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines). Everyone in Quahog is angered by this, except for Lois, who approves of the FCC's actions, believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency. However, she realizes that the FCC's presence puts her and Peter's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex, even if no one's watching (specifically banning thrusting, tongue-kissing, moaning and any movement whatsoever). Peter angrily blames her, thus causing her <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> for letting this happen. They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed. At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter honorably retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it, such as the Capitol Building to a breast. The oppression of the FCC is finally gone, Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks, and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The Brady Bunch that features bathroom jokes.|$|E

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns to}} Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her {{authority}} when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty.</b> She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching his hand through the wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return"). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying [...] "no" [...] too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.|$|E

And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E

2500|$|The {{boundaries}} between concepts of shame, guilt, and embarrassment {{are not easily}} delineated. According to cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict, shame {{is a violation of}} cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values. Thus shame arises when one's 'defects' are exposed to others, and results from the negative evaluation (whether real or imagined) of others; guilt, on the other hand, comes from one's own negative evaluation of oneself, for instance, when one acts contrary to one's values or idea of one's self. (Thus, {{it might be possible to}} feel ashamed of thought or behavior that no one actually knows about [...] and conversely, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> about actions that gain the approval of others.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists.

Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty,</b> but we do need to feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting."
