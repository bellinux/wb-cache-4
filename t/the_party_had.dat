5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> become stranded {{on the wrong side of}} the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In his Cabinet appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> not {{originally}} supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> held several {{ordinary}} congresses throughout different cities, mostly focussing on provinces in south-eastern Turkey.

5|$|Initially {{the young}} would-be {{candidate}} {{was offered the}} opportunity of succeeding the party leader, Clement Davies, in the Welsh seat of Montgomeryshire, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for North Cornwall, Dingle Foot, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring North Devon constituency. The Torrington local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September various {{opinion polls}} showed that Folkvords {{popularity}} had increased again in Oslo which {{gave rise to}} speculation that Folkvord would win Inger Lise Husøy's seat in parliament because of this sudden rise in popularity. When 99% {{of the vote in}} Oslo had been counted <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> managed to earn a disappointing 3.9%, losing its only seat.|$|E
5|$|Several {{leaders of}} the disbanded Catholic Centre Party were also murdered in the purge. <b>The</b> <b>Party</b> <b>had</b> {{generally}} been aligned with the Social Democrats and Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism, being critical of Nazi ideology, but voting nonetheless for the enabling act of 1933.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} {{supported a}} form of Quebec federalism that supports Quebec remaining within the Canadian federation while also supporting reforms that would allow Quebec substantial autonomy. While <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been described as centre-right {{in the context of}} Canadian politics, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> believes in a strong role for government in the economy and supports socially liberal policies. Also <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had a prominent social-democratic faction within it that was historically prominent in <b>the</b> <b>party</b> during <b>the</b> Quiet Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{adopted a}} One-China policy, arguing {{that there is}} only one state called China, and that the Republic of China (not the People's Republic of China) is its {{legitimate}} government. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had conflicts with <b>the</b> Chinese Communist <b>Party.</b> Since 2008, however, in order to ease tensions with the People's Republic of China, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> endorsed <b>the</b> [...] "three nos" [...] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou - no unification, no independence and no use of force.|$|R

5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{no strong}} {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy. While it supported privatisation and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported protectionism and defended the welfare state, especially if {{allocated to the}} native Flemish population.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>party's</b> {{election}} {{program for}} the 2001 parliamentary election stated that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> was a [...] "socialist party" [...] with {{a vision of a}} Norway without social injustice. Since its inception, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> promoted itself as socialist. In later years, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been portrayed as social democratic by some in the Norwegian media, and as democratic socialists. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been categorised as eco-socialist.

5|$|After {{the vote}} count, the Progressive Conservatives emerged with nine more seats than they {{held at the}} {{dissolution}} of the previous legislature. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> won 69.5 percent of the popular vote, the highest popular vote share ever attained by the PC party in the province. Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district.

5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> no interest in removing De la Rúa from power, {{because he was so}} unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Perón did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Perón. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage {{and the organization of}} the Female Peronist Party granted Juan Perón a large majority (sixty-three percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> a mixed stance {{towards the}} recent Ukraine crisis. Gregor Gysi has {{described}} Russia as [...] "state capitalist", and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> called Russia annexation of Crimea and alleged involvement in eastern Ukraine [...] "illegal". However, Gysi {{has noted that}} [...] "older" [...] elements of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>have</b> a strong penchant for Russia and the Soviet Union. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> declared in May 2014 that Ukraine shouldn't receive any kind of support from Germany {{as long as there}} are [...] "fascists" [...] inside its government.|$|R

These include Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the Party for the Netherlands—none of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. More importantly however, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV).|$|E
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{little chance of}} being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail because one of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E
