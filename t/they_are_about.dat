5|$|Adults have a {{complete}} moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> eight weeks old.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning {{is determined by the}} things that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> in the external world. This makes it difficult to explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth and the Night's Watch loyalists, who are {{guarding}} Jon Snow's body {{within a}} chamber in the castle, prepare themselves for battle when Alliser Thorne {{and his allies}} begin {{to break down the}} door. As <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to break through, the outer gates of the Castle are breached by the giant Wun Wun, followed by Tormund Giantsbane and an army of Wildlings, who have returned with Dolorous Edd. Outnumbered, the Night's Watchmen lay down their arms, and Alliser and the mutineers are dragged off to the cells under Edd's orders.|$|E

5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at {{about three years}} of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual {{maturity}} when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> four years old, although they can produce sperm as early as two years. While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual maturity. Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.|$|E
5|$|In the town, Rick and Glenn find Hershel {{alone in}} a tavern, {{drinking}} and lamenting {{the loss of his}} family members. Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, but as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to leave, two men from Philadelphia enter the bar—Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's farm is, looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location, and shoots them both before they fire back on him.|$|E
5|$|Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass is a {{collection}} of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the City Journal magazine. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> personal , the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of the underclass. Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into {{a collection}}, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor in relationships. People {{are often}} as concerned about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E
5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 5km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E
5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E

5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day in Springfield, Lisa's {{class at}} the Springfield Elementary School {{construction}} paper mailboxes for the Valentine cards <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to receive. When Ralph does not get any cards and breaks down in tears, Lisa hastily gives him a card out of sympathy. Ralph immediately cheers up, and develops a romantic interest in her. Ralph begins to annoy Lisa at every turn. Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she {{is not ready to}} be romantic, but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, as well as a leading part for himself in a President's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars. Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{endeavours}} {{to steal}} the funds needed for King Richard's ransom, and begins robbing the rich {{with the help of}} Sherwood's outlaws, whom he has gradually befriended. At the same time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother, is working to raise the ransom through more legal methods: by taxing clergy and laymen for a quarter of the value of their property, confiscating the gold and silver treasures of the churches, and imposing scutage and carucage taxes. Back in the small village of Locksley, Marian is captured and sent to the Sheriff's dungeon, where she is given an ultimatum: marry DeLacey or find herself charged with witchcraft. She is rescued by Robert, who arrives with his friends to free her. Just as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to be arrested by a wrathful Prince John, whose money has been stolen by the outlaws, King Richard arrives unexpectedly, allowing Robert and his associates to escape.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterward, {{another woman}} is found murdered at Coney Island {{in a similar}} manner; Stuckey finds a soda can with a bloody {{fingerprint}} on it, later confirmed to be Harrison's. The police learn Harrison disclosed his hiding place to a friend on a conspiracy theorist website; Munch recognizes the friend as his ex-wife Gwen (Carol Kane), whom he convinces to reveal Harrison's location. After Harrison evades capture, Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer, who said she has been taking care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child. An unstable Harrison visits Zimmer, who calls Stabler and Benson to arrest him. As <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> {{to return to the}} precinct, Zimmer gets locked into her car and a poisonous gas is released into the air; Stabler breaks her car window, but is unable to save her in time.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E

5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building is something of a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E
5|$|Things {{escalate}} {{quickly and}} the police arrive, responding to a noise complaint. The partygoers remain silent, convincing the officers that the party has already ended. The police leave and the party resumes. T-Rick's gnome is smashed, revealing that it contains {{a large amount of}} ecstasy tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers. Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to have sex and leaves the party upset. The noise and chaos of the party, which has now spilled into the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house. A dwarf guest drives Thomas' dad's Mercedes into the pool after being put into an oven by other partygoers.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
