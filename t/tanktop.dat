They hold their arms stiffly at their sides, speak slowly in loud, throaty voices punctuated by frequent grunts and groans, and have a fondness for pointless violence. All of them are surnamed Gumby: D.P. Gumby, R.S. Gumby, etc. Even though all Pythons played Gumbys in the show's run, the character is most closely associated with Michael Palin.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout all his depictions, Dio Brando {{maintains}} shoulder-length {{blond hair}} while possessing a towering, muscular build {{as impressive as}} that of the series' titular protagonists. His various designs all see clothing that prominently display the color gold. Once he takes over the body of Jonathan Joestar, the first protagonist of JoJo, he abandons his pattern of ornate clothes in favor of simple jackets, <b>tanktops,</b> bracelets, and pants that continue to emphasize the color gold, while simultaneously contrasting this with the rather outlandish wardrobe choices of gold-colored elf shoes and a bright green headband, belt, and knee pads bearing heart symbols. Prior to his full reveal, he appears topless during various interludes in the shadows of his mansion, his face remaining unseen until his reunion with Jean-Pierre Polnareff. After consuming Joseph Joestar's blood, DIO abandons his jacket and accessories, his spiked blonde hair becomes more prominent, his facial expressions become more manic in nature, and his lips are tinted dark green; this appearance {{is often referred to as}} [...] "High DIO" [...] (in reference to him describing this state as [...] "the ultimate high") in merchandise.|$|R
50|$|Experts {{recommend}} nursing bras {{that are}} stretchy, absorbent, and don't bind the breasts {{in any way}} that could interfere with milk flow.

It is not necessary to wear a bra at night, although if a woman's breasts leak excessively, she can wear a loose <b>tanktop</b> at night.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Mapplethorpe knew REX and was {{attracted}} to his hard-core imagery relating to the Mineshaft. The photographer developed a photographic portfolio that reflected the same themes and, like Rex, had strong links with the West Coast fetish scene (they both had work published by Drummer magazine editor Jack Fritscher). The photographer was more focused on Los Angeles whilst Rex preferred San Francisco. His work secured an invitation in April 1978 from Robert Opel to have a one-man exhibit at his newly opened Fey Wey Gallery on Harrison Street in San Francisco. REX's hyper-masculine men of this period were best described by Jack Fritscher, who {{was also one of}} Mapplethorpe's lovers, who met Rex in person {{for the first time at}} the opening: [...] "Rex is artist of urban toilets, blue-collar hotels, filthy construction workers, greasy gas jockeys, muscled bikers, tattooed fighters, beautiful young homeless bums ... ex-cons, armpit-sweaty beautiful studs needing head - all these unshaved [...] "lone wolves" [...] in jockstraps, leather, boots, and torn <b>tanktops</b> ... who pay-per-night in sleaze-bag hotels where sailors, Marines, cops, and drifters lie back on stained mattresses, the smoke of their cigarettes drifting out the crack of their rooms, down to the toilet where the cracked urinal drips beer piss, and the graffiti-covered stall is drilled with gloryholes ..." ...|$|R

5000|$|Designed by Akira Yasuda, Zangief was {{initially}} conceived for Street Fighter II {{as a character}} named [...] "Vodka Gobalsky", planned {{to be a very}} strong but extremely slow character to play as.

5000|$|Louie (voiced by Elizabeth Daily) - Wears a green <b>tanktop</b> {{with green}} {{shorts and a}} {{backwards}} green cap. Louie is {{a huge fan of}} comic books and sports - more so than his brothers, with his favorite comic book hero being Mantis Boy. Louie owns a violin just as Mantis Boy does; at first he is not good playing the violin at all, indeed it is regarded as noise to anyone who hears it, but eventually he learns to play it very well. On occasions, Louie uses it to play sad music when he and his brothers are manipulating Donald in order to get out of trouble. In one episode, it was revealed that Louie feels very strongly for animal rights and even makes plans to set traps to catch poachers to stop them taking animals. He can be fickle when it comes to deciding what to be for a future career; he has made ideas to become an astronaut, a sky diver, a top gun pilot, a hockey goal keeper and a policeman. Despite Louie sometimes fails to understand people's aims, he {{has proven to be a}} rational thinker; and sometimes an oddball, when the trio come up with a plan for a particular situation Louie is usually the first of the boys to have second thoughts and rethink the plan and compare it to the situation. When Louie was given super powers he became very muscular and strong. He referred to himself as Captain Muscle. Louie's full name is Louis.|$|E
