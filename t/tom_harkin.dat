5|$|Bedell {{decided not}} to seek reelection in 1986 after {{contracting}} Lyme Disease from a tick bite. Since then, he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. Due largely to his friendship with <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin,</b> he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E
5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin</b> due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E

50|$|Neighborhoods in the Village of Wilde Lake {{were built}} around the Oakland Manor, a former slave plantation. Some {{historical}} buildings were razed for the development, but other stone outbuildings dating to the 1700s still stand in the community. John E Slayton was hired {{to be the first}} manager of Columbia. He moved into a historic home with his wife Barbra becoming Columbia's first resident and postmaster. Officials would not release the cause of the 37-year-old manager's sudden death soon after in January 1967. Guards were stationed at the private access roads to the post office for safety reasons, but were later ordered to allow the public access during its operating hours. Ten homebuilding contractors were chosen to build homes in the development. James P. Ryan left his family business Ryan Homes to form Ryland Homes with Columbia as its first client for pre-fabricated homes. <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkins</b> built the first three hundred apartment in Howard County. In June 1967, Rouse offered its first public tours of Columbia, allowing visitors to travel on marked paved streets or take guided minibus tours. Early citizens of the new Cove development fought Rouse land-clearing operations in 1969 and lost as Rouse Company representatives were appointed to the first Columbia Association positions. Over time, a new association seat opened for every 4000 residents. The various neighborhoods include: Columbia's oldest apartments built in 1967, Bryant Woods (named for William Cullen Bryant); Faulkner Ridge (named for William Faulkner); Running Brook (where the streets are named for Robert Frost's poems and Aesop's Fables, e.g. The Birches).|$|R

25|$|Hollywood {{actor and}} native Iowan Stephen Collins was the {{featured}} {{speaker at the}} 2010 commencement ceremony {{and spoke to the}} 234 graduating students about his views on counter-culturalism.

25|$|Miller {{established}} himself as a conservative on virtually all economic issues. He was the first Democrat in the Senate to publicly declare his support for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, a broad-based tax cut which was criticized by opponents for favoring the rich and being fiscally irresponsible. Miller was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment to that same bill submitted by <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin</b> (D-Iowa) to scale back portions of that tax cut in order to spend more on education and debt reduction. He strongly opposed the estate tax and voted a number of times for its repeal. He also advocated drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
25|$|Metabolife, {{makers of}} the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had {{received}} over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA. Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin</b> (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested {{that the number of}} problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin</b> (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor union support. Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Kooser {{graduated}} from Ames High School with {{a class of}} 175 students and enrolled at Iowa State University, the alma mater of his uncles.

500|$|In {{the first}} primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton {{finished}} a distant third to Iowa Senator <b>Tom</b> <b>Harkin.</b> During {{the campaign for}} the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly {{in the polls and}} coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him [...] "The Comeback Kid" [...] for earning a firm second-place finish.|$|E
500|$|Amtrak {{currently}} {{does not}} serve Davenport or the Quad Cities. The closest station currently is about [...] away in Galesburg, Illinois.

In October 2010, a $230million federal fund was announced that will bring Amtrak service to the Quad Cities, with a new line running from Moline to Chicago. They hope to have the lined completed in 2015, and offer two round trips daily to Chicago. Greyhound Lines/Burlington Trailways bus service has a station in Davenport. The building is shared with the local Davenport Citibus. Davenport does not have any river ports.|$|E
