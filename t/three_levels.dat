Two level inverter is the basic technique to implement any level. The main advantage of the two level inverter is simple in computation and also switching device selection is simple. It is becomes difficult in high voltage & high power applications due to the increased switching losses and limited rating of the dc link voltage. Multilevel inverters are used in high voltage and high power applications with less harmonic contents.
