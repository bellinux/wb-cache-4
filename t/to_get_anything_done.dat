25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, made it difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia {{was sent back to}} the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E
500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery was the only way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons. Baker said of Khartoum [...] "a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined". He described the Governor General Musa Pasha as combining [...] "the worst of Oriental failings with the brutality of a wild animal".|$|E

60|$|The older Roman {{families}} were called patricians, or fathers, and thought all rights to govern belonged to them.

There was a council of patricians called the Senate, chosen among themselves, and also containing by right all who had been chief magistrates. The whole assembly of the patricians was called the Comitia. They, as has been said before, fought on horseback, while the plebeians fought on foot; but out of the rich plebeians a body was formed called the knights, who also used horses, and wore gold rings like the patricians.|$|E

60|$|This {{had taken}} place {{immediately}} after Mr. Wharton's offer of the £5000, in making which he had stipulated that Emily should be left at home. Then a few days went by, and Lopez was pressed for his money {{at the office of}} the San Juan mine. Did he or did he not mean to take up the mining shares allotted to him? If he did mean to do so, he must do it at once. He swore by all his gods that of course he meant to take them up. Had not Mr. Wharton himself been at the office saying that he intended to pay for them? Was not that sufficient guarantee? They knew well enough that Mr. Wharton was a man to whom the raising of £5000 could be a matter of no difficulty. But they did not know, never could know, how impossible it was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> by Mr. Wharton. But Mr. Wharton had promised to pay for the shares, and when money was concerned his word would surely suffice.

But the conference was ended by allowing the new local manager another fortnight in which to complete the arrangement.|$|E
6000|$|I was at Arked one day, and Lady Diana {{was telling}} me of the great {{rambling}} house at Killy Marey, and how, when she arrived as a bride, none of the doors would shut except two that would not open, behind one of which lived the family ghost; how the paper hung in festoons on the walls, and the chairs were of the loveliest primrose-coloured brocade; and how the green of the meadows was so wonderful, that she was always remembering it was the Emerald Isle; but how hopeless and impossible it was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> properly <b>done,</b> and how no good could be done where the Romish priests had interfered. All the old story of course. In the midst, a telegraph paper was brought to her; she turned deadly white, and bade me open it, for she could not. I knew she thought her son had met his father's fate, and expected to astonish her with the tidings that he was coming home by the next steamer, or that he had sent some game, or the like.

Romania {{had a number of}} captured modern Soviet tanks and field guns and it was decided to convert them to tank destroyers on the model of the German Marder II. The T-60 light tank was chosen because Romanian industry could maintain it, not least because its engine was a license-built Dodge-Derotto-Fargo F.H.2 for which spares were available in both Romania and Germany. A captured Soviet [...] M-1936 F-22 field gun was removed from its carriage and a new mount was fabricated to fit the gun to a turretless T-60. A fighting compartment was built using armor salvaged from captured Soviet tanks and the suspension was reinforced to handle its greater weight. Leonida finished the prototype on 19 January 1943.|$|R

It made me feel a pretty mean man, I can tell you. Your mother did not say much about her circumstances, but it did not need that. I knew that John had retired from the navy with little besides his half-pay, and that her pension as his widow must be a mighty slim one. Altogether I had a pretty bad time of it. However, I took a tall oath that the next rich strike I made the dollars should not be thrown away. I reckoned that you would be out before long; for it was certain that if you were a lad of spirit you would not be staying there doing nothing.

60|$|I say civilized motive advisedly; for {{primitive}} tribal {{motives are}} {{easy enough to}} find. Every savage chief {{who is not a}} Mahomet learns that if he wishes to strike the imagination of his tribe--and without doing that he can rule them--he must terrify or revolt them from time to time by acts of hideous cruelty or disgusting unnaturalness. We are far from being as superior to such tribes as we imagine. It is very doubtful indeed whether Peter the Great could have effected the changes he made in Russia if he had not fascinated and intimidated his people by his monstrous cruelties and grotesque escapades. Had he been a nineteenth-century king of England, {{he would have had to}} wait for some huge accidental calamity: a cholera epidemic, a war, or an insurrection, before waking us up sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> Vivisection helps the doctor to rule us as Peter ruled the Russians. The notion that the man who does dreadful things is superhuman, and that therefore he can also do wonderful things either as ruler, avenger, healer, or what not, is by no means confined to barbarians. Just as the manifold wickednesses and stupidities of our criminal code are supported, not by any general comprehension of law or study of jurisprudence, not even by simple vindictiveness, but by the superstition that a calamity of any sort must be expiated by a human sacrifice; so the wickednesses and stupidities of our medicine men are rooted in superstitions that have no more to do with science than the traditional ceremony of christening an ironclad has to do with the effectiveness of its armament. We have only to turn to Macaulay's description of the treatment of Charles II in his last illness to see how strongly his physicians felt that their only chance of cheating death was by outraging nature in tormenting and disgusting their unfortunate patient. True, this was more than two centuries ago; but I have heard my own nineteenth-century grandfather describe the cupping and firing and nauseous medicines of his time with perfect credulity as to their beneficial effects; and some more modern treatments appear to me quite as barbarous. It is in this way that vivisection pays the doctor. It appeals to the fear and credulity of the savage in us; and without fear and credulity half the private doctor's occupation and seven-eighths of his influence would be gone.|$|E

Why, if I want to take a fellow into the library, in the first place it smells like a vault, and I have to unbarricade windows, and unlock and rummage for half an hour before I can get at anything; and I know Aunt Zeruah is standing tiptoe at the door, ready to whip everything back and lock up again. A fellow can't be social, or take any comfort in showing his books and pictures that way. Then there's our great, light dining-room, with its sunny south windows,--Aunt Zeruah got us out of that early in April, because she said the flies would speck the frescoes and get into the china-closet, and we have been eating in a little dingy den, with a window looking out on a back alley, ever since; and Aunt Zeruah says that now the dining-room is always in perfect order, and that it is such a care off Sophie's mind that I ought to be willing to eat down cellar {{to the end of the}} chapter. Now, you see, Chris, my position is a delicate one, because Sophie's folks all agree that, if there is anything in creation that is ignorant and dreadful and mustn't be allowed his way anywhere, it's 'a man.' Why, you'd think, to hear Aunt Zeruah talk, that we were all like bulls in a china-shop, ready to toss and tear and rend, if we are not kept down cellar and chained; and she worries Sophie, and Sophie's mother comes in and worries, and if I try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> differently Sophie cries, and says she don't know what to do, and so I give it up. Now, if I want to ask a few of our set in sociably to dinner, I can't have them where we eat down cellar,--oh, that would never do! Aunt Zeruah and Sophie's mother and the whole family would think the family honor was forever ruined and undone. We mustn't ask them unless we open the dining-room, and have out all the best china, and get the silver home from the bank; and if we do that, Aunt Zeruah doesn't sleep for a week beforehand, getting ready for it, and for a week after, getting things put away; and then she tells me that, in Sophie's delicate state, it really is abominable for me to increase her cares, and so I invite fellows to dine with me at Delmonico's, and then Sophie cries, and Sophie's mother says it doesn't look respectable for a family man to be dining at public places; but, hang it, a fellow wants a home somewhere!" ...|$|E

40|$|Fraud {{can take}} many forms in the public service. It {{can be as simple}} as false entries on an employee’s {{timesheet}} or it can be as elaborate as a falsely valued property or lease deal. The major fraud control survey released in 2012 showed that fraud control measures are improving, but there is more work to be done. Recent investigations by the ICAC have highlighted the risks associated with public sector employees receiving undisclosed gifts and benefits. Sound policies and registers alone will not prevent people choosing to deliberately hide the receipt of gifts and benefits. They will, however, assist those seeking to do the right thing and make it harder for wrongdoers to claim they were confused or unaware. As a general rule, public servants should never expect <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> extra for <b>doing</b> what they are paid to do. They should never solicit personal gifts or accept any payment, gift or benefit intended or likely to influence them to stray from the proper exercise of their official duties. Dealing with gifts and benefits is not straightforward. The situation can be complex given the vastly different operating contexts and risk environments faced by NSW public sector agencies. This audit highlights the effort agencies devote to formulating and reviewing gift and benefit policies tailored to their business and also identifies good practices and some areas for improvement. The audit also highlights the lack of State-wide guidance to assist agencies. I think a set of minimum standards is needed to guide all public servants in managing the offers of gifts and benefits they receive from external parties. Such standards will also make it easier for suppliers, licensees, lessees and other organisations that deal with the public sector to better understand what the rules are and how to comply...|$|R
