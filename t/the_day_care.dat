25|$|Invigorated by {{the arrival}} of {{enthusiastic}} new members, the IWW began a wave of organizing drives. These largely took a regional form and they, as well as the union's overall membership, concentrated in Portland, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and throughout the state of California, which when combined accounted for over half of union drives from 1970 to 1979. In Portland, Oregon, the IWW led campaigns at Winter Products (a brass plating plant) in 1972, at a local Winchell's Donuts (where a strike was waged and lost), at the Albina Day Care (where key union demands were won, including the firing of the director of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>care),</b> of healthcare workers at West Side School and the Portland Medical Center, and of agricultural workers in 1974. The latter effort led to the founding of an IWW union hall in Burnside, Oregon to compete with extortionate hiring halls and day labor agencies. Organizing efforts led to a growth in membership, but repeated loss of strikes and organizing campaigns would anticipate the decline of the Portland branch after the mid-1970s, a stagnancy period which would last until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Malick is {{introduced}} {{on the verge}} of being fired from Holby City Hospital, after assaulting his boss on <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> Surgical ward. He explains to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that it was necessary to save a patient: resuscitation had been abandoned, but after forcefully taking control of the situation, Malick was able to revive them. On the proviso that he attends anger management counselling, Hanssen gives Malick a final chance and attaches him to the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). There, he soon clashes with the unit's staff: consultant Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), Foundation doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood), and ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). Relations begin to improve when Malick is left in charge of the unit for the day. Although he initially dismisses Penny's diagnoses and advice, ultimately he is forced to call on Michael for help and realises that she was right all along. He also becomes Frieda's mentor when she is accepted onto the Foundation programme. A racist patient makes a complaint about Malick; when her condition rapidly deteriorates in theatre, he walks out, causing the junior AAU staff to believe he has abandoned them. Malick soon returns with a crash team and saves the patient's life. Penny develops a crush on him, but Frieda informs her he is gay.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Nordoff, a Juilliard School {{graduate}} and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, {{gave up his}} academic career to further investigate the possibility of music {{as a means for}} therapy. Clive Robbins, a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for over 17 years in the exploration and research of music’s effects on disabled children—first in the United Kingdom, and then in the USA in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, emotional disturbances, developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with autistic children at the University of Pennsylvania gave rise to the National Institutes of Health's first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study [...] "Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> unit" [...] involved research, publication, training and treatment. Several publications, including Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children, Creative Music Therapy, Music Therapy in Special Education, as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins's success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989.|$|E

Initially, a review of research which supports <b>the</b> necessity of <b>day</b> <b>care</b> standards is presented. Next, <b>the</b> current <b>day</b> <b>care</b> regulations at <b>the</b> {{federal and state}} levels are compared and data tabulated for individual state listings for staff and child ratio, group size, staff training, program content of child care centers, entry age, staff qualifications, and other factors). An analysis of existing regulations is provided which reveals deficiencies in <b>the</b> existing state <b>day</b> <b>care</b> regulations in mandating a safe and healthy <b>day</b> <b>care</b> environment for infants and toddlers. Finally, child care policy implications are discussed, including the need for enactment of Federal standards for <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> a national conference on <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> a government funded cost analysis of quality <b>day</b> <b>care</b> for <b>the</b> consumer, a national <b>day</b> <b>care</b> clearinghouse, <b>the</b> need for paid infant care leave, and parent education in selecting <b>day</b> <b>care</b> programs.
