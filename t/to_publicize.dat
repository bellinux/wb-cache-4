5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard <b>to</b> <b>publicize</b> the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing <b>to</b> <b>publicize</b> needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France.

[...] After the Hemings' controversy ran its course, Callender turned <b>to</b> <b>publicizing</b> Jefferson's earlier attempt to seduce a married neighbor decades before.|$|R

The Ministry of Unification denied any connection between the announcements and the election campaign.|$|R
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, {{as it has}} been suggested that the criminal trial could be used as a platform for radicals <b>to</b> <b>publicize</b> their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, {{it has been suggested that}} an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
5|$|The RNC hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, <b>to</b> <b>publicize</b> Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in a presidential campaign.

50|$|Research {{compiled}} from two sources (a Cornell University nationwide study, and a Harvard University study on youth) {{has shown that}} social stratification between age groups causes stereotyping and generalization; for instance, the media-perpetuated myth that all adolescents are immature, violent and rebellious.
