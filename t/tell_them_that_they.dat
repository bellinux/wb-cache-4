25|$|The {{fellowship}} leave Moria {{and pass}} through Lothlórien. Soon thereafter, they are {{attacked by a}} party of Uruk-hai. Frodo and Sam set off to Mordor alone, Boromir is killed, and Merry and Pippin are taken prisoner by the Uruks. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas set out in pursuit across Rohan, heading towards Saruman's home in Isengard. The trio catch {{up to see the}} Uruks wiped out by the Rohirrim, led by Éomer (Chris Edgerly). The Riders <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not see the hobbits, but suggest that they may have fled into nearby Fangorn Forest. Moving through Fangorn, the trio encounter Elder (Bob Joles), an Ent, who tells them the orcs of Isengard are using the wood of Fangorn to construct weapons and siege towers. They help Elder destroy two construction camps, before he goes to tell the other Ents of Saruman's treachery. Meanwhile, continuing to track Merry and Pippin, the trio encounter Gandalf, resurrected by the Valar to aid in the coming war. He tells them Merry and Pippin are safe with the Ents, and instead, they must travel to Edoras, where the king of Rohan, Théoden (Brian George), has had his mind corrupted by Saruman's magic.|$|E
25|$|Rose and the Doctor also {{decide to}} {{investigate}} the party and don servant garb to disguise themselves. The Doctor and Rose learn that Pete and Jackie are childless and about to divorce. When Rose attempts {{to discuss it with}} Jackie she is rebuked for overstepping her bounds. Suddenly the party is interrupted by the Cybermen, who smash into the house and surround the guests. Lumic calls the President, who is in attendance, telling him that he is moving forward with his plans and that all of humanity will be upgraded. Lumic tells everyone that upgrading is compulsory and that anyone who refuses will be deleted. The President refuses to be upgraded and is killed by a Cyberman. The partygoers panic, try to flee and the Cybermen begin killing them. The Doctor, Rose, and Pete escape the house and encounter Mickey and the Preachers outside. They try firing upon the advancing Cybermen with automatic rifles, but their bullets do no damage and soon they are surrounded. The Doctor tells everyone to surrender and tells the Cybermen that they are volunteering for the upgrade. The Cybermen <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are incompatible and will be deleted. The episode ends with the Cybermen advancing on them.|$|E

500|$|When SpongeBob {{goes around}} {{to the back of the}} Krusty Krab to take out the trash, he reads some {{graffiti}} written on a dumpster, one of which he does not understand. SpongeBob asks Patrick what is it and Patrick says that the word is a [...] "sentence enhancer" [...] which is used [...] "when you want to talk fancy." [...] The next day, SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab and says the word to Patrick and then over the intercom. The Krusty Krab customers are appalled by SpongeBob's use of his [...] "word" [...] and leave. Squidward then informs Mr. Krabs, who then decides to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were using profanity, and mentions that there are 13 swear words they should not use. SpongeBob and Patrick vow Mr. Krabs that they will never use swear words again.|$|E
500|$|The boys {{seek help}} from a medium (a parody of Zelda Rubinstein's {{character}} in Poltergeist), who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory, which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The medium manages to contact the spirits and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have passed on. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all accept the fact. Two deceased celebrities, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze, tell her that Michael Jackson's refusal to acknowledge his death is {{the main cause of}} them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but also a little white girl. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which flings the medium out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, flight attendants and pilot voice-over announcements.|$|E

Although they used to hate each other, they become good friends and start to learn about each other.|$|R

2500|$|Jean {{embraced her}} role as acting commander-in-chief, {{one of her first}} {{international}} duties being a trip, from October 29–30, 2005, to France for the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at Trenton, Ontario, of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women's Day, stating: [...] "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I am here to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan." [...] Part of the Governor General's itinerary included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, Royal Canadian Mounted Police teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.|$|E
2500|$|Patriarch Irinej of Serbia {{asserted}} that the May 2014 flooding in the region was [...] "divine punishment" [...] from God for Wurst's victory. Patriarch Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Wurst's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a [...] "freak show". Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated [...] "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't {{have to talk about}} sexuality, where you're from, what you believe. Is this the worst thing {{in the mind of the}} politicians?" [...] She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, [...] "To <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something." [...] To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: [...] "It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Emma and Hook {{arrive at}} Granny's Diner together, {{with both of}} them telling a {{concerned}} David and Mary Margaret that they were fine, despite Emma's change in appearance, and with Hook adding that he [...] "didn't look like a Crocodile just yet." [...] The others <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can finally continue their quest to destroy the Darkness, with Hook volunteering to get Merlin from the Diner. As Merlin was finishing the message that would be later be received in Storybrooke, Hook appears and locks the doors, revealing that he planned to cast another Dark Curse in order to get his revenge on Gold. Merlin says that this is impossible, since he would have to crush the heart of [...] "the thing they love most" [...] to enact it, and Hook would never kill Emma. Hook then takes Merlin’s heart, and the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin morphs into one of Nimue, who appears to see Hook crush the heart. Just then, Emma enters, devastated to find out that Hook has tricked her. Hook says that he had always planned to get his revenge on Gold, and adds that no one will ever control him again, before sending Excalibur back into the Stone to ensure this. When Emma asks Nimue why she was helping Hook, Nimue reveals that Hook had made a deal with her: the Darkness would ensure Hook vengeance on Gold while Hook in turn would help the Darkness snuff out the Light, which devastates Emma. Nimue goes on to explain that when Hook crushes Merlin's heart, it also counts as her crushing his heart, since she is [...] "in all the Dark Ones," [...] which will allow Hook's Curse to work. Emma tries desperately to convince Hook to stop, telling him that he doesn't need revenge, and that his happy ending was with her. She warns Hook that if he crushes Merlin's heart, he will destroy his happy ending. However, Hook states that it was her [...] "lovesick puppy dog" [...] "Killian Jones" [...] who {{had fallen in love with}} her, claiming that his former self was killed when she [...] "turned him into a Dark One." [...] Then, he suddenly crushes Merlin’s heart in his hand, to enact the Curse. When Merlin dies, Emma tells Merlin that she was sorry, before dissolving his body and telling him to rest in peace. Unable to stop the Curse, a heartbroken Emma knocks Hook out, before using a dreamcatcher to erase Hook's memories, to prevent him from remembering why he cast the Curse. Then, at the behest of the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, Emma brings her parents, Henry, Regina, Robin, Belle, their friends and Zelena (whom she reinstalled the magic-inhibiting cuff on) back to Granny's Diner in an unconscious state, before using the dreamcatcher to erase all of their memories, and to add a forgetting spell to the Curse, to keep Hook from ever finding out that he was a Dark One. Meanwhile, in Camelot, Arthur is shocked to find Excalibur's fragment returned to the Stone, and Guinevere points out the cloud of the Curse, which Arthur describes as [...] "extremely dark magic." [...] Then, Merida (who was riding her way back to Camelot to fight Arthur), Arthur, and Guinevere look on as the purple cloud of the Dark Curse engulfs Camelot and part of the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
