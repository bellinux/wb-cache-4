The association brought the Edmonton Exhibition to Edmonton, one of the prominent fairs of the west at the time. As telephone service was brought to Edmonton, McCauley was one of the first to receive one installed. His telephone number was #1. When John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair would visit Edmonton for business, McCauley and his wife would usually be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> entertain him. Also an avid curler, McCauley was a founder of the Royal Curling Club in Edmonton and led his curling team where he served as a skip. He also enjoyed other sports, including horse carriage racing.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E

The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> turn on the more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away.

5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue {{for the first five}} chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{modified}} version of the Rockport Fitness Walking Test (RFWT) has been determined to be reliable for persons with mental retardation. Previous investigations have used one pacer for each participant. While this protocol may be reliable, it is not likely feasible in most school or community-based settings. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is twofold: first to evaluate the reliability of a {{modified version}} of <b>the</b> RFWT using <b>one</b> pacer per five participants; second, to determine the agreement among <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> protocol and <b>the</b> proposed five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> protocol. This study compared the end completion times and mean peak heart rates of three different one-mile walking sessions of 35 participants with mild mental retardation. Eighteen females (21. 1 ± 2. 7 yr.) and 17 males (19. 7 ± 2. 8 yr.) participated in each testing session. Each participant randomly completed two sessions of walking with one pacer per five participants and one session of one pacer per participant on an indoor surface 1 / 9 th of a mile long. Results from ANOVA indicated end completion times and mean peak heart rates did not differ based on gender (p= 0. 798), sessions (p= 0. 053), and gender x sessions (p= 0. 855). To determine agreement, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for end completion times for <b>the</b> first five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> (R= 0. 83) and <b>the</b> second five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> (R= 0. 85). ICC's were calculated for mean peak heart rates for <b>the</b> first five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> (R= 0. 95) and for <b>the</b> second five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> (R= 0. 93). The results support that <b>the</b> five <b>to</b> <b>one</b> modified walking protocol produces results similar to the results using <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> testing...|$|R

25|$|Any bishop ordinarily has the {{authority}} to hear confessions worldwide, unless the local bishop where the confession takes place or the penitent's own bishop has made an objection. The Pope, as the supreme earthly Catholic judge, and all cardinals have the right to hear confessions of any Catholic anywhere in the world by virtue of canon law. A Catholic of one rite may have a confessor of another rite in communion with Rome. Major superiors, rectors of seminaries and heads of houses of formation, and heads of novitiates should not ordinarily be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> hear the confessions of those they supervise unless the person freely requests it of them (they may not make use of any information learned in confession when they are disciplining their charges because of the seal of confession).|$|E
25|$|Receptive {{females are}} <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> locate male territories by {{examining}} tree-falls or large light gaps within their foraging ranges. Female E. imperialis behavior, when entering a territory, initially {{resembles that of}} an intruding male. The female flies up within 5cm of the resident male and hovers until the male flies out to investigate. The male and female then engage in a tight circular flight path, less than 20cm apart, until the female lands on the perch of the tree. The female then presses its body close to the tree trunk, with its wings held down. The male then lands on her dorsum to copulate with the female, which lasts a brief 5 seconds. After mating, the female then immediately leaves the territory. It {{is also important to}} note that mating only occurs in relatively solitary territories in which no other males are present. It is theorized that female E. imperialis possibly only mate once in their lifetime {{due to the fact that}} a very limited number of female foraging ranges actually overlap with any given male territory.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of}} it all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
