40|$|AbstractMany machine {{learning}} based algorithms contain a training step {{that is done}} once. The training step is usually computational expensive since it involves processing of huge matrices. If the <b>training</b> <b>profile</b> is extracted from an evolving dynamic dataset, {{it has to be}} updated as some features of the training dataset are changed. This paper proposes a solution how to update this profile efficiently. Therefore, we investigate how to update the <b>training</b> <b>profile</b> when the data is constantly evolving. We assume that the data is modeled by a kernel method and processed by a spectral decomposition. In many algorithms for clustering and classification, a low dimensional representation of the affinity (kernel) graph of the embedded training dataset is computed. Then, it is used for classifying newly arrived data points. We present methods for updating such embeddings of the training datasets in an incremental way without the need to perform the entire computation upon the occurrences of changes in a small number of the training samples. Efficient computation of such an algorithm is critical in many web based applications...|$|R

The instrument was developed {{within the framework of}} a European research, coordinated by the Groningen University and which includes five countries. We analyzed the answers of the Romanian students starting from the working hypothesis that a potential correlation between the answers and the training profile of the specific High School in which they learn (in our case, theoretical and vocational) can be identified. Starting from the initial research instrument, students' answers were organized in eight categories within three clusters, organized around their perception of the utility and interest of studying History for their professional life, for general learning, and for their personal development. In more technical terms, three testlets were developed in order to better pinpoint their attitudes towards History as a subject. The comparative analysis is useful {{in the context of the}} debate concerning the <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> provided by High Schools (as specific stage in their compulsory education), and over the ways in which the History curriculum might be better developed.

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} if {{the characteristics}} and <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> of runners are significant indicators to predict a {{successful completion of}} a marathon. Methods. Experimental design: comparative investigation between two groups of runners at a marathon race. Setting: participants of the study came from the 1998 Standard Chartered New Airport International Marathon in Hong Kong. Participants: 113 runners were investigated, of which 58 runners dropped out at the first 10 km of the race, while the other 55 were those that consulted for physiothearpy service after the marathon. Measures: using questionnaire, the characteristics and the <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> of these runners were obtained. These included weekly training distance, longest and shortest training distance per session in one week; warm-up and stretching exercise with the training sessions, number of marathons previously finished and the runners' opinion of optimal training mileage to complete a marathon. Results. Independent t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment were used to investigate {{the difference between the}} two groups, the results showed significant difference in the weekly training distance (p= 0. 00), longest and shortest training distance per week (p= 0. 00), and personal opinion on optimal weekly training distance for a marathon (p= 0. 00). Logistic regression modeling was then employed to determine variables that best predict the likelihood of completing a marathon. Conclusions. The findings indicate that the non-finishers are poorly prepared and the results also identify that the longest mileage covered per training session is the best predictor for a successful completion of a marathon with an odds of 1. 21.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{arises from the}} need to attend to {{diversity}} in distance higher education, where, in recent years, a clear increase of students has been detected, increasing in turn, the teacher-student ratio.

40|$|Motivation: High-quality protein {{sequence}} alignments {{are essential}} {{for a number of}} downstream applications such as template-based protein structure prediction. In addition to the similarity score between sequence profile columns, many current profile-profile alignment tools use extra terms that compare 1 D structural properties such as secondary structure and solvent accessibility, which are predicted from short profile windows around each sequence position. Such scores add non-redundant information by evaluating the conservation of local patterns of hydrophobicity and other amino acid properties and thus exploiting correlations between profile columns. Results: Here, instead of predicting and comparing known 1 D properties, we follow an agnostic approach. We learn in an unsupervised fashion a set of maximally conserved patterns represented by 13 -residue sequence profiles, without the need to know the cause of the conservation of these patterns. We use a maximum likelihood approach to train a set of 32 such profiles that can best represent patterns conserved within pairs of remotely homologous, structurally aligned <b>training</b> <b>profiles.</b> We include the new context score into our HMM-HMM alignment tool hhsearch and improve especially the quality of difficult alignments significantly. Conclusion: The context similarity score improves the quality of homology models and other methods that depend on accurate pairwise alignments. Contact...|$|E

The runners in this study had similar anthropometric and <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> to other distance runners of a similar standard.

To evaluate the efficacy of a computerized working memory training program (BrainStim) in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Methods. Twenty-nine inpatients with chronic schizophrenia were assigned to either the intervention group receiving working memory training (N= 15) or the control group without intervention (N= 14). Training was performed {{four times a week}} for 45 minutes during four weeks under neuropsychological supervision. At baseline and followup all participants underwent neuropsychological testing.

Pre-post comparisons of neuropsychological measures showed improvements in visual and verbal working memories and visual short-term memory with small and large effect sizes in the intervention group. In contrast, the control group showed decreased performance in verbal working memory and only slight changes in visual working memory and visual and verbal short-term memories after 4 weeks.

40|$|International {{reports on}} early {{childhood}} education tend to attach increased importance to workforce profiles. Yet, a study in 15 European countries reveals that large groups of (assistant) staff remain invisible in most international reports. The CoRe research commissioned by the European Commission conducted a cross-national survey among experts in Belgium (Flemish- and French-speaking communities), Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (England and Wales). The survey explored professional and <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> {{not only in the}} formal “teaching” staff, but also within the entire workforce, making visible the assistants that are often omitted from international reports. The proportion of assistant staff varies from a very small percentage in some European countries to half of the entire workforce in many others. Assistants typically have a caring profile, while their higher qualified colleagues have an educational profile. Consequently, a divide between care and education can be observed, both in split systems and in integrated systems. In these cases, the concept of “education” may be narrowed down to learning and “care” may be regarded as subordinate to education. In several cases, assistants also have fewer entitlements for on-going professionalization than the educational staff. Consequences for practice as well as policy of this part of the CoRe study commissioned by the European Commission are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional phase-contrast {{velocity}} mapping in the {{ascending aorta}} was combined with k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE.

In addition, a modification of the k-t reconstruction strat-egy was tested. This strategy, denoted as “plug-in, ” incorpo-rates data acquired in the training stage into the final recon-struction for improved data consistency, similar to conventional keyhole. “k-t SENSE plug-in ” was found to provide best image quality and most accurate flow quantification.
