Penny candy became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason, candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating.|$|E

50|$|Weber {{disliked the}} empty {{nationalist}} ideas of many German nationalists. He thought that power alone {{was not an}} acceptable goal, that politicians should stand for certain ideas but that they need a strong will to power to win. This idea of the will to power was derived from Nietzsche, who was very popular in the Germany of the 1890s. But Nietzsche meant a strictly individual will to power and not a will to power to make a collective entity (like Germany) stronger as advocated by Weber. Weber wanted Germany to strengthen its economy by creating a huge empire. He {{was afraid of the}} huge world population that would lead to German unemployment in the long run and believed {{that the only way to}} support the German workers was to create an empire. He was afraid that an end would come to economic expansion and that countries would protect their own economy with tariff barriers.

5000|$|The {{development}} of cultural industry, <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> expansion of online platforms {{have led to}} a dynamic rise in fan translation [...] Followed by is the increase in voluntary translation communities as well as the variety of the content. There {{is no doubt that the}} largest beneficiaries are audience, readers and game players who are also fellow fans of various popular culture products, since they are given the chance to receive first-hand information from foreign cultures. The entertainment industry and other cultural industries also benefit because their products are given global exposure, with a consequence of cultural immersion and cultural assimilation. However, people also consider fan translation as a potential threat to professional translation. In fact, fan translation communities are built on the spirit of sharing, volunteering, a do-it-yourself attitude and most importantly, passion and enthusiasm for the same goal. Like a lot of specialization-based and art-based professions, rich experience and related knowledge are highly demanded in translation industry. Therefore, fan translation cannot be regarded as a threat. Instead, to some extent, it includes two significant senses: for fan translators, it means a period of valuable experience and a pack of adequate preparation no matter if they are willing to take their fun hobby into another level; for professional translators, it serves as a type of sources to be referred and consulted once they encounter similar situations. In addition, from the perspective of {{development of}} fan translation, the content is no longer limited within movies, video games and fan fictions. Various forms including educational courses, political speeches and critical news reports appear in recent years, which injects brand-new meaning to fan translation by extending its value from entertaining nature towards social significance. Just as Henry Jenkins states: “popular culture may be preparing the way for a more meaning public culture.” [...] As a newly emerging phenomena dependent on the progress of Internet-supported infrastructure, it surpasses its original focus on personal interest and makes itself visible in front of the entire society. As a result, it has to be admitted that fan translation is somehow an inevitable trend.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{knowledge}} exponential development, {{the multiple}} aspects of social problems, <b>the</b> fast <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> growing availability of <b>advanced</b> hardware <b>and</b> software are increasing demands on undergraduate engineering education and practice. Therefore, {{it is imperative}} that engineering teachers become able to accomplish much more than the simply assignment of transmitting informations: they have to teach the students “how to learn”so they might be prepared for any challenges. More effective teaching methods and techniques have to be considered beyond the traditional model, which is based on information transmission and fully centered on teacher’s figure. However, this methods implementation requires fully comprehension of the available alternatives – <b>and</b> <b>the</b> possibility of create them – by the teacher. This work aim to present David Kolb’s ideas about learning styles and also describee his empyrical model – the Learning Cycle – as an alternative strategy to deal with the largely used traditional way of teaching engineering. The four styles or types of learning identified by Kolb derive from the manner which people perceive and process new informations. Each one these styles are associated with some typical questions that represent the internal structure of learning, which {{can be seen as a}} standart model for new concepts learning and can be used regardless of subject matter. 1...|$|R
