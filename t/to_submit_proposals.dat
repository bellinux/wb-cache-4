5|$|The {{designs were}} {{prepared}} in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, {{who designed the}} obverse and his assistant, George T. Morgan, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals.</b> Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared {{only two of the}} five, and that because the artist assigned one, Evelyn Longman, had fallen ill. When the McKinley designs were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though Don Taxay, who so stated, does not say what they were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the designs were approved.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} {{temple in}} Guadalajara is pyramidal {{and has an}} innovative structure. The project began in 1983, when the Church's former temple built to accommodate 8,000 people was deemed insufficient to accommodate {{the growing number of}} people who attended various annual celebrations. Construction began on July 3, 1983 when Flores laid the cornerstone and lasted until August 1, 1992. The temple was completed largely by members of the Church. It is a notable architectural feature in Guadalajara in a working-class district {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Dozens of institutions, architects, and engineers were invited <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> for a new temple. The pyramidal design submitted by Leopoldo Fernández Font was from the final shortlist of four proposals. Fernandez Font was later awarded an honorary degree for this and other structures. He said that one of his favorite works is the Temple of the Resurrection, but that the temple of La Luz del Mundo seemed difficult to him. The temple was built to accommodate 12,000 worshipers and is used for annual ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|After {{developing}} her design, Piccinini and {{her studio}} developed a 3D {{model of the}} balloon using computer-aided design software. This process was used to address the technical issues involved with developing a balloon which was safe to fly, {{as well as to}} fine-tune the appearance of the design.

25|$|Amtrak asked railway {{equipment}} manufacturers <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals.</b> An X 2000 train was leased from Sweden for test runs from October 1992 to January 1993. It was operated from Washington DC to New York City from February to May and August to September 1993. Siemens showed the ICE 1 train from Germany, organizing the ICE Train North America Tour which started {{to operate on}} the Northeast Corridor on July 3, 1993. This testing allowed Amtrak to define a set of specifications that went into a public tender in October 1994.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, Mayor Sly James re-initiated the {{conversation}} for Kansas City's potential new terminal. Local design form Burns & McDonnell proactively proposed a privately funded option {{that would not}} require new public taxes. (Even if not privately funded, airport reconstruction would {{be paid for by}} takeoff and landing fees generated by the airport, not a separate tax initiative). Initially Burns & McDonnell were the only firm to present a privately funded option. In June 2017, Airport design firm AECOM also approached Kansas City to advise they would also submit a privately funded proposal. On July 18th 2017, two new teams emerged <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> to the city for a new terminal.|$|E

In January 2007 Norwich City Council submitted a bid for unitary status, but that was rejected in December 2008 {{because it did not}} meet all of the rigorous criteria for acceptance. In February 2008, the Boundary Committee for England was asked to consider other proposals for all or some of Norfolk, stating whether Norwich should become a unitary authority, meaning it would exercise all local government functions for the city and lie outside the administrative area of Norfolk County Council. The committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of Norfolk, including Norwich.|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} artists <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> {{resulted}} in a first exhibition in 1843 at Westminster Hall in which 140 cartoons were shown. Others followed but the progress was slow. Fresco {{proved to be a}} problematic technique for the English climate. The wall surfaces to be covered being vast, a number of paintings were in fact done in oil on canvas. With the death of Prince Albert in 1861 the scheme lost its driving force, but by then many paintings were completed or underway. William Dyce, who was the first to start fresco work in 1848, died in 1864, completing only five of seven commissioned works. The other major contributors were John Rogers Herbert, finishing in 1864 but having had some commissions cancelled, Charles West Cope who worked until 1869, Edward Matthew Ward until 1874, Edward Armitage, George Frederic Watts, John Callcott Horsley, John Tenniel and Daniel Maclise. In the 20th century, further paintings were commissioned from other artists.|$|E

25|$|The Committee {{will have}} both an {{advisory}} and decision-making nature; with powers <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> as well.

500|$|The Commission {{disliked the}} {{sketches}} from the Mint (submitted by Barber) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> {{for the new}} coins. [...] The sculptors could submit multiple sketches. [...] Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor, the designs were not fully interchangeable—by statute, an eagle had {{to appear on the}} reverse of the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime. [...] Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece.|$|E
500|$|These were duly held {{everywhere}} except Tunstall, {{where the}} council refused to participate. Fenton council {{made it clear}} that it would not back any proposal that did not have the support of its electorate. In Burslem, a high turnout of 74 per cent of voters delivered a vote of 3:2 against federation. The Staffordshire Advertiser described the events surrounding this poll as [...] "unprecedented" [...] with both proponents and opponents—chiefly the Association for Promoting the Federation of the Pottery Towns and the Burslem Anti-Federation League—making every effort to ensure their supporters voted. An indication of the strength of feeling and interest in the proposal is that the events surrounding the federation proposal were used as a background setting by the author Arnold Bennett in his contemporary (1908) novel The Old Wives' Tale. With Fenton, Tunstall and Burslem all opposing federation it was left to Hanley, Stoke and Longton <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>proposals</b> to the Local Government Board. The Local Government Board ruled that only the submission made by Longton met the statutory and other formal requirements and that it alone would form the basis of the subsequent local inquiry, held in January 1908.|$|E
