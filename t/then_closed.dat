5|$|After the war, coastal defences became {{increasingly}} irrelevant as nuclear weapons came {{to dominate the}} battlefield. The remaining Device Forts still in military use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> as military establishments. St Catherine's and Portland were decommissioned in the late 1940s, Hurst, Pendennis and Yarmouth in the 1950s, Southsea in 1960 and, after, the closure of its air base, Calshot followed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Derrick Henry scored Alabama's next {{touchdown}} {{early in}} the second quarter on a five-yard run that extended their lead to 14–0. On the next Chattanooga possession, Alabama again forced a punt, but this time Jones returned it 75-yards for a touchdown and a 21–0 lead. The Mocs responded with their best drive of the game; however, A'Shawn Robinson blocked a 48-yard Nick Pollard field goal attempt that kept Chattanooga scoreless. The Crimson Tide <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the half with a 28-yard AJ McCarron touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood that made the halftime score 28–0.|$|E

5|$|A {{weekly market}} was {{granted to the}} town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the {{junction}} of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction of the square began in 1983, the market was moved to a car park in Bank Close. Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> to traffic. Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass {{of the afternoon}} on the drive that ensued {{early in the second}} quarter on a 44-yard flea flicker pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{extended}} their lead to 10–0 after Shelley connected on a 24-yard field goal {{early in the}} third quarter. Early in the fourth, Trent Richardson scored on a two-yard run for a 17–0 Crimson Tide lead. However, on the ensuing kickoff was returned 68-yards to the Alabama 22-yard line by John Fulton, and four plays later the Bulldogs cut the score to 17–7 after Tyler Russell threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chris Smith. The Crimson Tide <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the game with an eleven-play, 73-yard drive, all on the ground, with Lacy scoring his second touchdown of the night from 32 yards out to give Alabama the 24–7 victory. The 127 rushing yards gained by Richardson was his seventh 100-yard rushing game of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 74–18–3 (76–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Starkey secured {{funding from}} Charles Marston and Henry Wellcome {{to start an}} {{expedition}} apart from the Petries, which Olga joined. The Wellcome-Marston expedition was {{to focus on the}} excavation of the ancient city of Lachish, a stronghold mentioned in the Bible. Over the next six years, the team made some important finds, including the Lachish letters, but the work was interrupted by the murder of Starkey, while he was en route to the opening of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The remaining team finished during the 1938/9 season, <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the site. Olga wrote the final report.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. He pointed {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E

5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} of June, Cancellara began the Tour de Luxembourg. He won the prologue {{and was the first}} to wear the race leader's yellow jersey. He then held the lead until the second stage came to a close when stage winner Linus Gerdemann took the lead away from him. Cancellara then raced the Tour de Suisse and won the opening and closing stages of the race, which were both {{individual}} time trials. He <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> out June by winning the Swiss National Road Race after he out-sprinted Steve Morabito for the win, which was his second Swiss National Road Race title.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, the {{building}} and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control of the Master Apartments. Horch <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the Roeriches' museum, forcing it to find a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled some aspects of {{the building and}} its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager.|$|E

5|$|The Persian {{military}} {{consisted of}} {{a diverse group of}} men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed with a bow, a 'short spear' and a sword or axe, carried a wicker shield. They wore a leather jerkin, although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor. The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> in to deliver the final blow with spears and swords. The first rank of Persian infantry formations, the so-called 'sparabara', had no bows, carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Saavedrist hegemony was short-lived. The {{military}} defeats of Castelli and Belgrano {{started a}} new political crisis, and the First Triumvirate replaced the Junta Grande as the executive power, and <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> it completely. The former supporters of Moreno (Belgrano, Dupuy, Tomás Guido, Beruti, Monteagudo, French, Vicente López) would later support the campaign of José de San Martín. The Argentine war of independence would give room to the Argentine Civil War between unitarians and federals. Saavedrists like Martín Rodríguez, Ortiz de Ocampo, de la Cruz—and even Saavedra himself—became unitarians. Manuel Moreno, French, Agrelo, Vicente López, and Pancho Planes opposed both the First Triumvirate and the presidency of unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia. Manuel Moreno and Tomás Guido, in particular, worked {{in the government of}} the most powerful federal leader, Juan Manuel de Rosas.|$|E
5|$|Wadhurst Tunnel {{collapsed}} in 1862 {{and it was}} discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too. Rectification cost £10,231. By 1877, only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time. The tunnel was partly widened in 1934–35. In November 1949, serious defects were discovered in the tunnel. Single-line working {{was put in place}} on 19November, but the tunnel had to be closed completely a week later. The tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments. It reopened to traffic on 5June 1950. Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938–39, remaining open with single-line working in operation. It partially collapsed on 17November 1974, resulting in single-line working until 31January 1975. The line was <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> until 17March whilst the track was singled through the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|After the Tigers' {{tied the}} game 17–17 on a 41-yard Colby Delahoussaye field goal {{to open the}} second half, the Crimson Tide went on their first of three {{consecutive}} touchdown drives. Their first touchdown came on a four-yard T. J. Yeldon run that capped a 14 play, 79-yard drive that included a successful fake punt. On their next possession, Yeldon scored on a one-yard touchdown run that extended Alabama's lead to 31–17. Odell Beckham Jr. then returned the kickoff that ensued 82-yards to the Crimson Tide 18-yard line. However, the offense was unable {{to capitalize on the}} good field position as the Alabama defense forced a turnover on downs. The Crimson Tide then drove 78 yards in eight plays, capping the drive with a three-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that made the score 38–17. The Alabama defense <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> the game with three consecutive sacks of Mettenberger, winning 38–17. For his 12 tackle performance, C. J. Mosley was recognized as both the SEC Defensive Player of the Week and as the Lott IMPACT National Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 48–25–5.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are <b>then</b> <b>closed</b> and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E
