5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of <b>the</b> <b>approaching</b> cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which <b>the</b> <b>approaching</b> cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of <b>the</b> <b>approaching</b> cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{functions}} need to {{be capable}} of constantly developing new manufacturing lines, cells, and pieces of equipment in order to maintain their operational competitiveness. This paper explores a unique approach to analyzing and designing manufacturing processes referred to as the Value Adding Process Point (VAPP) approach. This approach particularly focuses on the points where value is added to materials in manufacturing processes. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> is mostly used at Japanese companies and it has contributed to developing unique manufacturing lines, cells, and pieces of equipment that tend to be simple, slim, and compact, and require low investment cost. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> has also contributed to achieving major improvements in different performance measures in manufacturing. However, <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> is rarely known internationally. Moreover, the amount of practical information on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> at companies has been limited in the scarce literature on <b>the</b> <b>approach.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce <b>the</b> VAPP <b>approach</b> to a broader audience and also to provide practical information on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> by describing a case study in which <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> was applied at a Swedish manufacturing company. At the company, the application was made in a manner of experiential learning. In this paper, it is described how <b>the</b> VAPP <b>approach</b> was applied, what outcomes were generated by the application, and how participants in the case study experienced the application of <b>the</b> <b>approach.</b> Discussions are made as to usefulness of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> and effective use of <b>the</b> <b>approach.</b> xpre...|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the Isle of Youth on October 16. Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba. By {{the time the}} hurricane reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast. Gladys turned more to the north, passing {{just west of the}} Dry Tortugas, before resuming its north-northwest trajectory, possibly due to a mid-level low near Alabama. Around that time, the eye was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida, and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation being over the state. Early on October 19, Gladys made landfall near Homosassa after turning to the northeast, with peak winds estimated at 85 mph (130 km/h). It accelerated across the state due to <b>the</b> <b>approaching</b> trough, emerging into the Atlantic near St. Augustine. Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States, Gladys passed just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20, although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery. <b>The</b> <b>approaching</b> trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics, and on October 21 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia. A few hours later, the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{focus on}} two {{approaches}} to formal concept analysis (FCA) of data with fuzzy attributes recently {{proposed in the}} literature, namely, on <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> via hedges and <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> via thresholds. Both of <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> present parameterized ways to FCA of data with fuzzy attributes. Our paper shows basic relationships {{between the two of}} <b>the</b> <b>approaches.</b> Furthermore, we show that <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> can be com-bined in a natural way, i. e. we present an approach in which one deals with both thresholds and hedges. We argue that while <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> via thresholds is intuitively appealing, it can be considered a special case of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> via hedges. An important role in this analysis is played by so-called shifts of fuzzy attributes which appeared earlier in the study of factorization of fuzzy concept lattices. In addition to fuzzy concept lattices, we consider the idea of thresholds for the treatment of attribute implications from tables with fuzzy attributes and prove basic results concerning validity and non-redundant bases. ...|$|R
