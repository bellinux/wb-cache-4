40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we report}} the {{experimental}} observation of negative differential conductance (NDC) in a Ni/Ge Schottky diode. With {{the aid of}} theoretical models and numerical simula-tion, we show that, at reverse bias, electrons tunnel into the high electric field of the depletion region. This scatters the electrons into the upper valley of the Ge conduction band, which has a lower mobility. The observed NDC is hence attributed to the <b>transferred-electron</b> <b>effect.</b> This shows that Schottky contacts {{can be used to}} create hot electrons for transferred-electron devices.

40|$|GaN-based {{heterostructure}} {{field effect}} transistors (HFETs) have gained considerable attention in high-power microwave applications. So far, unsurpassed current levels and high output power at microwave frequencies have been achieved. However, the dominant factors limiting {{the reliability of}} these devices under high-power operation are still unsettled. Drain current collapse {{is one of the}} major encumbrances in the development of reliable high-power devices in this technology. In this thesis, an accurate and versatile analytical model based on the concept of virtual gate formation due to the existence of acceptor type surface states is developed to model the current-collapse phenomenon. The implementation of this simple and at the same time precise analytical model demonstrates superb agreement with the experimental observations of permanent/semi-permanent current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HFETs. An analytical model, with incorporation of <b>transferred-electron</b> <b>effect,</b> for drain-current characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs is also presented. Oftentimes, the transferred electron effect is neglected in modeling the drain-current characteristics of III-V HFETs. The broader steady-state electron drift-velocity overshoot of GaN in comparison to other direct semiconductors such as GaAs and InP, in addition to the larger difference between the peak and saturation drift-velocity, and the wider bandgap of this semiconductor predict the importance of the incorporation of <b>transferred-electron</b> <b>effect</b> (i. e. steady-state drift-velocity overshoot) in modeling the drain-current of these devices. Simulation results are compared with the results of the adoption of Ridley’s mobility model which does not take into account the <b>transferred-electron</b> <b>effect.</b> Solving the Poisson’s equation through a simple iterative method and considering the diffusion component of current are at the core of this model. The iterative nature of this approach has considerably relieved the outcome of the implementation from the choice of fitting parameters...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the principles of}} operation, state of the art, and future potential of active two-terminal devices for generation of low-noise, continuous-wave terahertz radiation. These devices use transit-time, <b>transferred-electron,</b> and quantum-mechanical <b>effects</b> (or a combination of them) to create a negative differential resistance (NDR) at the frequency of interest. Many different types of NDR devices have been proposed since {{the earliest days of}} semiconductor devices and studied in detailed simulations for their power generation potential, but have yet to be demonstrated experimentally. The paper focuses on NDR devices that not only yielded significant output powers at millimeter waves frequencies and higher, but also have the strong potential of generating radiation at terahertz frequencies. Examples of such NDR devices are resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), superlattice electronic devices (SLEDs), and InP Gunn devices. Examples of their state-of-the-art results are output powers of 0. 2 mW at 443 GHz and 5 μW at 1. 53 THz from InGaAs/AlAs double barrier RTDs on InP substrate; 5. 0 mW at 123. 3 GHz, 1. 1 mW at 155. 1 GHz, and 0. 52 mW at 252. 8 GHz from GaAs/AlAs superlattice electronic devices on GaAs substrate; and 330 μW at 412 GHz, 86 μW at 479 GHz, and 18 μW at 502 GHz from InP Gunn devices...|$|R
40|$|A {{wealth of}} unique physics makes the {{frequency}} band from 0. 3 ? 3. 0 THz technologically relevant and compact room-temperature semiconductor sources would en- able many new spectroscopic applications. All semiconductor sources currently have serious difficulties reaching the THz, and no THz device {{of any type}} operates on the full range at room temperature. This dissertation proposes a novel semiconductor source which utilizes the <b>transferred-electron</b> (Gunn) <b>effect</b> and the Smith-Purcell effect to operate over {{the majority of the}} 0. 3 ? 3. 0 THz band at room temperature. Mathematical derivations provide a theoretical analysis of the device and computer simulations explore its performance as a function of design. The dissertation begins with a description of the device and an overview of the field of terahertz science. A literature review establishes the relevance and uniqueness of the work and highlights the physical principles required to model the operation of the device. Next, the mathematical ?machinery? required model the device is built, starting with a derivation of the Butcher-Fawcett ?equal-areas? method used to calculate the Gunn effect. A description of the computer code written to implement the equal-areas method and examples validating its correct operation follow. A derivation of the Smith-Purcell effect provides a closed-form solution for the electric field, which is then combined with the Gunn effect results. With the theoretical methods thus established, a detailed explanation of the simulation methods used to model the device is provided, followed by a detailed comparison between theory and simulation ? in which it is shown that the theoretical methods display a high degree of agreement with computer simulations of the device. The results of an extensive design study are then presented that map the range of predicted results for this terahertz device. The Smith-Purcell device is found to perform better than or comparable to any state-of-the-art semiconductor THz source. At room temperature, a single 100 ?m-wide device is predicted to generate 365 ?W of power at 0. 28 THz and 1 ?W at 2. 5 THz. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for subsequent research ? most urgently for an attempt to experimentally verify the predictions of this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{interaction}} between <b>transferred-electron</b> <b>effect</b> and base widening {{under transient conditions}} in III-V heterojunction bipolar transistors is considered. Modification of the collector field profile with an n+ doping spike is shown to cause a time delay for the onset of Kirk effect creating conditions for the inception of charge instabilities. Numerical simulations suggest the possibility of sustainable intrinsic current oscillations in properly engineered bipolar transistor structures. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
