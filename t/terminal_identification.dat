An {{individual}} who intends {{to engage in}} sensitive transactions using a public terminal such as an ATM needs to trust that (a) all communications are indeed carried out with the intended terminal, (b) such communications are confidential, and (c) the terminal’s integrity is guaranteed. Satisfying such requirements prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping. We have analysed several existing transaction schemes and concluded that they tend not to meet all requirements during the entire transaction.

40|$|AbstractTwo splice {{variants}} of the 5 -HT 7 receptor {{were identified in}} human brain that differ in the lengths of their intracellular carboxy <b>terminal</b> tail. <b>Identification</b> of the {{variants of}} this receptor {{is of particular interest}} since the 5 -HT 7 receptor is known to have a high affinity for a number of antidepressants and is localized in brain regions thought to be implicated in depression. The two isoforms are expressed in roughly equal amounts in various regions of the human brain. When expressed in NIH- 3 T 3 cells, both variants encode functional 5 -HT 7 receptors, positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. We suggest that both variants are derived from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing. Furthermore, our results from Southern blot analysis studies suggest that additional 5 -HT 7 receptor genes may exist in human...|$|R
40|$|Motor axons receive {{retrograde}} {{signals from}} skeletal muscle {{that are essential}} for the differentiation and stabilization of motor nerve <b>terminals</b> 1. <b>Identification</b> of these retrograde signals has proved elusive, but their production by muscle depends upon the receptor tyrosine kinase, MuSK, and Lrp 4, a LDLR family member that forms a complex with MuSK, binds neural Agrin and stimulates MuSK kinase activity 2 – 5. Here, we show that Lrp 4 also functions as a direct muscle-derived retrograde signal for early steps in presynaptic differentiation. We demonstrate that Lrp 4 is necessary, independent of MuSK activation, for presynaptic differentiation in vivo, and we show that Lrp 4 binds to motor axons and induces clustering of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins. Thus, Lrp 4 acts bi-directionally and coordinates synapse formation by binding Agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation and in turn functioning as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that is necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation. Postsynaptic muscle cells provide signals to motor axons that regulate the formation, maturation, stabilization and plasticity of neuromuscular synapses 1. During development, motor axons approach and form synapses with muscle in a prepatterned region, marked b...|$|R

Three themes emerged: 1) the impact of terminal cancer on the family: 2) family functioning - responses to terminal cancer: and 3) quality of palliative care from the family perspective. The most substantial body of research describes family needs, family caregiving burdens, caregiving costs and the impact of the patient's terminal cancer on the health of family members. Small samples, high nonresponse rates, selection biases and a lack of standardized outcome measures have impeded and the advancement of knowledge.

30|$|The {{coordinator}} is {{a single}} agent that executes central management controls. The coordinator is responsible for arranging parking, uploading, offloading, and inspection. This agent receives requests to handle activities from all depots and the terminal. The coordinator is initiated with a real-time control function to appropriately select containers that meet certain criteria. The coordinator has different workflows in the non-physical internet enabled network and the physical internet enabled network. In the non-physical internet enabled network, the coordinator matches transport units with requests. Information regarding the shipper, client, freight volume, and client priorities {{is included in the}} order. Once receiving an order, the coordinator will process the above-mentioned items and allocate mobile resource units. Given an expected loading time, the coordinator will then pass the message to the closest tractor to pick up that particular physical internet container. Once a task is finished, both tractors and containers return empty and are prepared for the next mission, and the tractor might head towards a specific location. If containers are starved at a hub, the coordinator might trigger the repositioning of empty containers. In the physical internet enabled network, the coordinator is only responsible for handling activities at depots and the <b>terminal.</b> The <b>identification</b> of the route and transport segment will be carried out by each decentralised active container rather than a centralised delegation.|$|R

The strategy consists in comparing the critical times issued from the flow behavior of a liquid-crystal polymer to the equilibrium orientational-order relaxation time was characterized. We demonstrate that shear-induced phases do not originate from a flow coupling to conventional orientational order parameter fluctuations. It does not also correspond to a direct coupling with the viscoelastic terminal time, leading {{to the conclusion that}} an additional relaxation process takes place with time scales longer than the <b>terminal</b> time.

40|$|Tp 53, {{a stress}} {{response}} gene, {{is involved in}} diverse cell death pathways and its activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, whether the neuronal Tp 53 protein plays a direct role in regulating dopaminergic (DA) neuronal cell death or neuronal terminal damage in different neurotoxicant models is unknown. In our recent studies, {{in contrast to the}} global inhibition of Tp 53 function by pharmacological inhibitors and in traditional Tp 53 knock-out mice, we examined the effects of DA-specific Tp 53 gene deletion after 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine and methamphetamine exposure. Our data suggests that the Tp 53 gene might be involved in both neuronal apoptosis and neuronal terminal damage caused by different neurotoxicants. Additional results from other studies also suggest that as a master regulator of many pathways that regulate apoptosis and synaptic terminal damage, it is possible that Tp 53 may function as a signaling hub to integrate different signaling pathways to mediate distinctive target pathways. Tp 53 protein as a signaling hub might be able to evaluate the microenvironment of neurons, assess the forms and severities of injury incurred, and determine whether apoptotic cell death or neuronal <b>terminal</b> degeneration occurs. <b>Identification</b> of the precise mechanisms activated in distinct neuronal damage caused by different forms and severities of injuries might allow for development of specific Tp 53 inhibitors or ways to modulate distinct downstream target pathways involved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{report a}} new series of archaeal lipids, {{widespread}} in marine sediments and tentatively assigned as isoprenoid glycerol dialkanol diethers (GDDs). They are structural analogs of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), with one glycerol unit missing and with each biphytanyl moiety possessing a <b>terminal</b> OH group. <b>Identification</b> is based on molecular formulae determined from accurate mass measurement and interpretation of mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Acetylation of GDD- 0 confirmed the presence of three OH groups, and ether cleavage and reduction of the products afforded two biphytanyl chains. Tests of different protocols for both extraction and acid hydrolysis indicate that GDDs were not formed during sample preparation. The co-existence of GDDs and GDGTs in 12 selected marine sediment samples of varying origin showed that the ring distribution in these two ether lipid pools is related and implies that the two compound classes share a common biological source. The presence of isoprenoid GDDs is possibly linked to the occurrence of biphytane diols in marine sediments, where both GDD and diol can be either biosynthetic intermediates or degradation products, and supports the recently proposed fossil lipid recycling by benthic archaea (Takano, Y., Chikaraishi, Y., Ogawa, O.

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism with proxy mobile IPv 4, as a mobility solution in networks. In this mechanism during mobile node access authentication, MPA exchanges registration messages with the HA (Home Agent) {{to set up a}} suitable routing and tunneling for packets from/to the MN. In this method, the authentication request of the mobile node is passed through the NAS or AP of visiting network, this is then passed to the AAA (Authentication Authorization and Accounting) server, and the authentication server checks the realm and does start authentication procedure at the time of initialing authorizing module of the mobile terminal. It also initiates the mobility extension module, where the AAA server initiates MPA of the access network, which also informs the AAA server of the home network with information on the mobility extensions and request of the mobility parameters of the user terminal. The home AAA server interacts with the HA and collects mobile node parameters, as well as sending back details as a reply request to the visiting AAA server. After the mobility context transfer, the MPA conducts a mobility registration to the HA for that particular mobile node. Later in this paper, we will provide sequence of message exchanges during a mobility session of a user mobile node during handover...|$|R
