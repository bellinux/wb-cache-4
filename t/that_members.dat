5|$|However, Seymour later recanted her story, {{and another}} man came forth {{claiming}} to know {{the identity of the}} real killer. This new evidence, along with the behaviour of the judge in both the initial case and the appeal, made the case controversial enough <b>that</b> <b>Members</b> of Parliament from the three major political parties directly questioned the Home Secretary on the matter. Despite many requests for clemency, all appeals were denied, and Williams was executed in 1913. The case {{was one of the first}} investigations in Britain to use the emerging science of ballistics.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, kitsunetsuki {{was noted}} {{as a disease}} {{as early as the}} Heian period and {{remained}} a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations <b>that</b> <b>members</b> of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>members</b> moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
