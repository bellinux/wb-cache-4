Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E

After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E

5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>six</b> connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution.
