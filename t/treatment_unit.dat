5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive <b>treatment</b> <b>unit</b> has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E

25|$|Typically, the oil {{layer is}} skimmed off and {{subsequently}} re-processed or disposed of, {{and the bottom}} sediment layer is removed by a chain and flight scraper (or similar device) and a sludge pump.

25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} a local {{treatment}} {{that is designed to}} treat the defined tumour and spare the surrounding normal tissue from receiving doses above specified dose tolerances. There are many factors that may contribute to differences between the planned dose distribution and the delivered dose distribution. One such factor is uncertainty in patient position on the <b>treatment</b> <b>unit.</b> IGRT is a component of the radiation therapy process that incorporates imaging coordinates from the treatment plan to be delivered in order to ensure the patient is properly aligned in the treatment room.|$|E
500|$|After {{discharge}} from the inpatient rehabilitation <b>treatment</b> <b>unit,</b> care may be given on an outpatient basis.

30|$|Numbers of {{regenerating}} oak stems {{significantly increased}} on <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> immediately after burning (B and MB) and remained higher than on C or M <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> throughout the study.

Gains in oak reproduction numbers in B and MB <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> indicate {{that there were no}} negative short-term impacts to oak. However, those gains may be only short term as sprouts self-thin or as they are killed by repeated burning as open woodland condition is created.|$|R

Some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary <b>treatment</b> <b>unit.</b> This means that during very heavy rainfall events, the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed {{to protect them from}} hydraulic overloading, and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the current {{situation}} in substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> in Finland in taking non-Finnish speaking clients into consideration. The initiative for this research came from the Development of Alcohol and Drugs Intervention group at Stakes (National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health). Their aim was to gather information about the functioning and relevance of the quality assessment forms based on the quality recommendations for substance abuse work, filled in by substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units.</b> The ethnic issue was chosen as the main approach in the study. The aim of this research was to answer the following questions: what is the readiness and competence in substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> in Finland to receive and encounter non-Finnish speaking clients, how is the quality of these services assessed and/or developed in the units, and what has been the role and functioning of the quality recommendations and quality assessment forms in working with non-Finnish speaking clients. The research methods used in the study were both quantitative and qualitative. The information concerning language services provided in the units was gathered from the quality assessment forms and basic information forms found in the database maintained by Stakes. The total amount of units found in the database was 267. In addition to that, semi-structured theme-interviews were carried out in four substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> in order to get a more deep understanding of how the services function in practice. The few number of non-Finnish speaking clients in the units may explain to a certain degree the results of the research. The results however showed that there is still space for improving the services. In the light of quality recommendations, the degree of language options provided in substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> in Finland today is low. Also the quantity of interpreter services provided in the units is scarce. There could also be unified guidelines specially tailored for substance abuse <b>treatment</b> <b>units</b> on how to work with ethnic minorities, as the knowledge is currently adopted from several different instances. The quality recommendations as well as quality assessment forms were valued and applied in the units appropriately and were also perceived to have an effect on the functioning, and quality, in the units...|$|R
