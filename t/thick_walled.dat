5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning {{that there are}} three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are <b>thick</b> <b>walled,</b> measuring 3–7μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} of E.frostii is olive brown. The spores are <b>thick</b> <b>walled,</b> smooth, and spindle shaped, with {{dimensions}} of 11–15 by 4–5µm. Longer spores up to 18µm long {{may also be}} present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E.frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century cannons {{became more}} {{frequent}} tools {{of war and}} <b>thick</b> <b>walled</b> fortresses like Koldinghus partly lost their defensive significance. For this reason king Christian III added several buildings to the fortress and eventually {{turned it into a}} royal residence instead. The new residence became popular among the royal family and Prince Frederick, the heir apparent, grew up at Koldinghus. ChristianIII sometimes held court at the castle and it was here on 1January 1559 that he died. When Christian IV became king in 1588 he choose to expand it further with the addition of the “Giant tower”. The tower was so named because of the 4 statues of giants from the Greek and Roman mythology (Hannibal, Hector, Scipio and Hercules) which adorned it. Today, the only statue on the tower is that of Hercules, since Hannibal and Hector were crushed during the 1808 fire and in a storm in 1854, Scipio fell to the ground.|$|E

2500|$|Eucalyptus is {{the most}} common short fibre source for {{pulpwood}} to make pulp. Eucalyptus globulus (in temperate climates) and the hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis (in tropical climates) are the most used varieties in papermaking. [...] The fibre length of Eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood. The fibres are slender, yet relatively <b>thick</b> <b>walled.</b> This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers. The low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers. [...] Eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness.|$|E
2500|$|The colon crypts {{are shaped}} like {{microscopic}} <b>thick</b> <b>walled</b> test tubes {{with a central}} hole {{down the length of}} the tube (the crypt lumen). Four tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. [...] In these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). [...] The nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. As seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. [...] Baker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. [...] Thus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2530 cells per colonic crypt. [...] Nooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1500 to 4900 cells per colonic crypt. [...] Cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. [...] There are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.|$|E
2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl. It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high shrinkage rate probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a <b>thick</b> <b>walled</b> construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an unfired state, without collapsing during the air-drying process in preparation for firing. Non-backswamp clays used {{in many parts of the}} world could use grog and/or sand and create a round-bottomed vessel, favored by the cook, but not so with the [...] "gumbo" [...] clays of the Mississippi Valley.|$|E

This equipment is currently {{used at the}} Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory, UK, at temperatures up to about 230 °C. To demonstrate the utility of this approach three experiments are described: crystallization of Fe- and Cr- doped tobermorite starting compositions to produce mixed tobermorite/xonotlite end products; crystallization of gyrolite and pectolite from a starting gel of gyrolite composition reacted with NaOH solution; and formation of the hydrogarnet, katoite, from a mixture of portlandite, amorphous alumina and amorphous silica.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{beam theory}} for arbitrary open section laminated composite beams subjected to generalized beam loading is developed using a {{strength of materials}} approach. At present, the theory is limited to statistically determinate beams. Solution of the general system of equations yields strain and curvature distributions as functions of the axial coordinate x and the contour coordinate s. Average stresses on a given cross section or ply stresses in a local coordinate system are determined using these distributions. Data obtained for thin-walled open section composite beams reveal that elastic coupling occurs among curvatures, shearing strains, and axial strain, depending on the laminate stiffness parameters. Laminate ply layup {{does not affect the}} location of the shear center in the thin-wall approximation, but may have a significant impact for <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> open sections.

50|$|The {{thicknesses}} of {{the water}} pipe and tube walls can vary. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the Standard Dimension Ratio (SDR), defined as {{the ratio of the}} pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter). Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. <b>Thicker</b> <b>walled</b> pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances.|$|R
30|$|Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) is an {{important}} native species of Southeast Asia, producing an excellent quality wood with high demand in the world market contributing positively to development and economic growth of the countries. There are few published studies on the anatomical variability of teak wood from East Timor. The wood anatomical characterization and its within-tree variation were studied in three axial and radial positions of trees from an unmanaged pure stand. The wood is semi-ring-porous to ring-porous. The vessels are solitary and grouped, with 206 and 89  µm diameter (earlywood and latewood) and 259  µm length. Axial parenchyma is paratracheal unilateral and marginal. Rays are homocellular and heterocellular, varying between 241 and 1293  µm in height. Fibers, the most abundant tissue (52  %), had a mean fiber length, width and wall thickness of 1.15  mm, 28 and 6  µm, respectively. The anatomical features of teak wood differ from those reported for other origins in considerably smaller vessels and <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> fibers.

40|$|The {{crystallization}} of {{the complex}} halide PbI 2 in discrete and bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), and <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> nanotubes is described. The nanotubes were produced by either arc synthesis or catalytic chemical vapor deposition. The obtained crystals could be {{described in terms of}} ID fragments derived principally from the 2 H form of PbI 2, although some evidence for the formation of fragments derived from 4 H PbI 2 in some nanotubes was observed. The crystallization inside nanotubes was compared to the crystallization behavior of bulk PbI 2 as determined by X-ray powder diffraction measurements obtained under comparable heating conditions. While the 2 H to 4 H polytype transition is clearly observable in bulk PbI 2, stacking behavior correlated with this type of polytypism was only very occasionally observed within nanotubes, suggesting that crystallizing PbI 2 within nanotubes has a tendency to order the halide into the 2 H form. Additionally, PbI 2 apparently does not crystallize in rigid narrow DWNTs with internal diameters of less than 2 nm. Raman studies performed on the PbI 2 -filled nanotubes show that the ratio of intensity of the D and G bands generally increases after filling and that both the RBM peaks and the G band are slightly upshifted. © 2006 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} phenomenon occurring {{before and}} at the critical heat flux (CHF) for subcooled flow boiling has been investigated. The first phase of this study established the basic nature of the flow structure at CHF. A photographic study of the flow in a glass annular test section was accomplished by using microflash lighting and a Polaroid camera. The {{results showed that the}} flow structure at CHF for high heat flux (1 x 106 - 5 x 106 Btu/hr-ft 2), high subcooling (50 - 110 *F), at low pressures (less than 100 psia) was slug or froth flow depending on the mass velocity. Nucleation was shown to exist in the superheated liquid film. Pin-holes in the burned-out test sections suggested that the CHF condition was extremely localized. Flow regime studies in tubular and annular geometries, using an electrical resistance probe, provided further evidence of the slug or froth nature of the flow, and also showed that dryout of the superheated liquid film was not responsible for CHF. Since this evidence was contradictory to previously formulated models of CHF,a new model was proposed: Near the CHF condition, nucleation is present in the superheated liquid film near the surface. As a large vapor clot passes over the surface, these nucleating bubbles break the film and cause a stable dry spot which results in an increased local temperature. As the vapor finally passes the site, the dry spot is quenched by the liquid slug, and the temperature drops. At CHF, the volumetric heat generation, slug frequency, and void fraction are such that the temperature rise resulting from the dry spot is greater than the temperature drop during quenching. An unstable situation results where the temperature of this point continues to rise when each vapor clot passes the site until the Leidenfrost temperature is reached, at which point quenching is prevented and destruction is inevitable. (cont.) A new method of measuring surface wall temperatures, in conjunction with high speed (Fastax) 16 mm movies, confirmed the microscopic features of the proposed model. At CHF, the wall temperature cyclically increased with the same frequency as the slug-vapor bubble passage. Destruction finally resulted as the temperature increased beyond the Leidenfrost point. An analytical investigation based on an idealized model demonstrated that the cyclical nature of the temperature increase at CHF could be predicted with appropriate flow pattern inputs. A parametric study using the program indicated that heater thickness and heater material should affect the CHF. It was shown that the proposed model appears to be consistent with parametric trends, i. e. mass velocity, pressure, subcooling, diameter, length, and surface tension. The model indicated that the CHF for <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> tubes, keeping all other conditions the same, would increase. CHF tests were conducted which confirmed that <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> tubes (0. 078 vs. 0. 012 in.) had CHF up to 58 percent higher than thin walled tubes.

Little {{research has been done}} on the fatigue of thin-walled tubular sections below 4 mm thickness. The weld profile and weld undercut may affect the fatigue crack propagation life of welded joints especially for thin-walled sections. Numerical analysis of 2 -dimensional non-load carrying thin-walled cruciform joints was performed to determine the effect of weld profile and weld undercut on fatigue crack propagation life under cyclic tensile loading. The cruciform joints analysed are made up of 3 mm thick plates, joined by fillet welds. The Boundary Element Analysis System Software (BEASY) is used, which uses fracture mechanics theory to carry out crack propagation analysis. The weld profiles and weld undercuts were measured from welded connections in thin-walled fillet welded sections. The measured weld profiles and undercut were used in the analysis. The results are compared with those of a similar study to determine the comparative reduction in fatigue crack propagation life between thin-walled cruciform joints (T= 3 mm) and <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> cruciform joints (T= 20 mm).

30|$|We {{analyzed}} punch cores {{to determine}} the timing of transition from earlywood to latewood. We examined each punch core under a high-magnification microscope (at 10 × to 40 × magnification) {{to determine whether the}} most recently produced tracheid cells were earlywood (i.e., larger, thinner walled cells) or latewood (smaller, <b>thicker</b> <b>walled</b> cells). Overly suppressed growth or poor sample quality occurred in < 5 % of collected punch cores; these samples were not used. For each year at each study area, we determined which trees transitioned between each collection period. Trees were considered to have transitioned during a given time window (between date x and date y) if the punch cores showed earlywood at date x and then latewood at date y. Occasionally, replicate cores from the same tree and same sample date did not match in terms of most recent production of earlywood versus latewood, which is consistent with expected variability in growth patterns around a tree bole (Fritts 1976, Speer 2010). In these cases, we used the earliest date of latewood production as the end date of the transition period. After determining when individual trees transitioned between earlywood and latewood, we calculated the percentage of all trees that transitioned between sample dates for each year at each study area. If > 75 % of trees transitioned between two subsequent sample dates, then we defined the transition period as the month in which the midpoint between the two sampling dates fell. If < 75 % of trees transitioned between two subsequent sample dates (which was the case in two of the seven combinations of study area and year), then three subsequent sampling dates were used and the transition period was defined as the month containing the midpoint between the earliest and latest dates.|$|R
