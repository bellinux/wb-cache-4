2500|$|A {{telephone}} number {{serves as an}} address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing. [...] Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> which transmits the sequence of digits {{in the process of}} signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party. Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional {{telephone number}}ing plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.|$|E
2500|$|The TR.9D HF radio <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> in fighters at {{the time}} of the Battle of Britain had two {{channels}} and the operating frequencies of the two could only be selected before take-off. One channel was used for voice communication with sector control, while the other was used by the [...] "pip-squeak" [...] system. With only one voice channel, set to a squadron-specific frequency, the TR.9D limited the ability to co-ordinate with other squadrons. The set was low power, with a range of about [...] air-to-ground and [...] air-to-air, which presented numerous problems with reception quality. The TR.9 originally operated on a band that was relatively empty, but by the time of the war it was much busier and interference was a constant problem.|$|E

Very faintly but with distinctness I could hear Higgs's high voice saying, [...] "Look out, Sergeant, there's another rush coming!" [...] and Quick answering, [...] "Shoot low, Professor; for the Lord's sake shoot low. You are empty, sir. Load up, load up! Here's a clip of cartridges. Don't fire too fast.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> for the 1A2 systems were modifications of the Bell System standard 500-series telephones for rotary dial systems, and the 2500-series Touch-Tone desk sets. For key system operation these sets were equipped {{with a set of}} push-buttons (keys) and additional internal contact springs to control the additional operational features, resulting in a large variety of specialty telephones. Specifically, such <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). <b>Telephone</b> <b>sets</b> could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R
50|$|LSI {{also allowed}} smaller systems to {{distribute}} the control (and features) into individual <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that don't require any single shared control unit. Generally, these systems are used with a relatively few <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.|$|R

50|$|Initially, the {{operating}} telephone companies {{wanted to have}} the caller ID function performed by the central office as a voice announcement and charged on a per-call basis. John Harris, an employee of Northern Telecom's <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> manufacturing division in London, Ontario promoted {{the idea of having}} caller ID as a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> display. The telephone was coded ECCS for Enhanced Custom Calling Services. A video of his prototype was used to leverage the feature from the central office to the <b>telephone</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E

50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack (type No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R

50|$|Each {{connection}} to a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> required six wires from the key system: One pair (two wires) carried the talk circuit (tip and ring), one pair carried control information, known as A-Leads, for that line, designated A and A1, and the third pair carried current to a lamp for the specific line key position on the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> (L and LG).|$|E

50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a key {{telephone}} system (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system manually select their own outgoing lines on special <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically, or formerly, by an operator. The <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> connected to a PBX do not normally have special keys for central-office line control, {{but it is not}} uncommon for key systems to be connected to a PBX to extend its services.|$|R
50|$|All early <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> had dials {{with metal}} finger wheels, while {{starting}} in 1941 the colored thermoplastic units featured clear plastic finger wheels. Dial number plates {{were made from}} steel with a white vitreous enamel face. Black 302 <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were equipped from the factory with straight brown textile-covered cords until 1952, when synthetic rubber (Neoprene) jacketed cords became standard equipment. Optional retractile coiled cords were available both in textile and rubber jackets since the early 1940s.|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s, <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were {{developed}} that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s {{in many areas}} enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s. After World-War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, {{were developed}} that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.|$|R
