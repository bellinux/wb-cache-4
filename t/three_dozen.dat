40|$|International audienceUltrathin bismuth iron garnet Bi 3 Fe 5 O 12 {{films were}} grown epitaxially on (001) -oriented {{gadolinium}} gallium garnet substrates. Film thickness varied {{from two to}} <b>three</b> <b>dozens</b> of unit cells. Bi 3 Fe 5 O 12 films grow pseudomorphically on substrates up to a thickness of 20 nm, and then a lattice relaxation occurs. Magnetic properties of the films were studied {{as a function of}} bismuth iron garnet thickness. The magnetization and cubic anisotropy decrease with decreasing film thickness. The uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is constant for all film thicknesses. For two unit cell thick films, the easy magnetization axis changes from in-plane to perpendicular to the plane direction. Such a reorientation takes place {{as a result of the}} competition of constant uniaxial perpendicular anisotropy with weakening film magnetization. (C) 2013 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Autostereoscope is a {{technology}} that allows for a viewer to obtain stereoscopic effect without wearing glasses. This may potentially {{be used as a}} replacement or alternative to the current goggle-based stereoscopic technologies used in visualization and mapping practice. This paper studies the principles of popular autostereoscopic technologies, fundamental issues in using this technology for visualization, photogrammetry, and the performance of autostereoscopic photogrammetric measurement. In particular, the autostereoscopic effect is studied in terms of viewing zone and perceived depth. As a fundamental step towards autostereoscopic photogrammetry, the imaging geometry of such displays is analytically presented. To evaluate the properties and performance of the autostereoscopic measurement, we conduct a series of experiments using a backlight autostereoscopic display. A stereo pair at a pixel size of 25 and 50 microns are used in the study. <b>Three</b> <b>dozens</b> of well defined and easily identified feature points are measured by seven operators using the developed autostereoscopic measurement toolkit Auto 3 D.
