25|$|In September 1950, the anti-communist {{magazine}} Red Channels accused Bromberg {{of being}} a member of the American Communist Party.

25|$|On appeal, Salaam's {{supporters}} and attorneys charged {{that he had}} been held by police without access to parents or guardians. The majority appellate court decision noted that Salaam had initially lied to police in claiming to be 16, and he had backed up his claim with a transit pass that indeed (falsely, as it turned out) indicated that he was 16. If a suspect has reached 16 years of age, his parents or guardians no longer have a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions.</b> When Salaam informed police of his true age, police permitted his mother to be present.|$|E
25|$|A {{probationary}} {{condition that}} a defendant testify under oath on all {{questions as to}} his financial condition relating to amounts and locations of all assets was upheld as legal because the defendant made a blanket refusal <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions,</b> and therefore {{it could not be}} shown that his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated by any particular question. It was ruled that a court did not abuse its discretion in requiring, as a condition of supervised release, that the defendant report financial obligations in excess of $250 incurred by his wife. The condition was held to serve a legitimate monitoring purpose in light of the defendant's history of masking his income and ownership of assets, and the financial information was also deemed necessary for evaluating the defendant's ability to meet his restitution schedule.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, Ripken {{finally reached}} the major leagues when the Orioles named him their bullpen coach. Halfway through 1977, he became the third base coach for the Orioles when Billy Hunter was hired to be {{the manager of the}} Texas Rangers. Ripken served in this role through the 1986 season. During this time, and even later when he became a manager, he would pitch batting {{practice}} and hit fungoes before games. He {{would be one of the}} last members of the team to leave after games. Ripken could be tough on the players he coached, enjoying using the term [...] "lunkhead" [...] when talking to them, but he would always make time <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions</b> they had about the game. Doug DeCinces, who played under him through the 1981 season, recalled, [...] "He was the dictator of that regimen, instructing us on everything down to how to wear our socks. He said, `Take pride in your appearance and you'll take pride in your game.'" [...] The Orioles experienced great success during this time, reaching the World Series in 1979, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Four years later, Ripken earned a World Series ring as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series in five games over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

[...] On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. [...] Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that [...] "I have said the whole truth in court, and nothing but the truth; and I don't choose <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>any</b> <b>questions,</b> unless it be in court again." [...] Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship Tryal for her voyage to British America. [...] Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the Myrtilla in August 1754. [...] Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. [...] She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. [...] Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761.
