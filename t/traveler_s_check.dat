40|$|Model {{checking}} is {{an approach}} commonly applied for automated veri cation of reachability properties. Given a system S and a property p, reachability model checking consists in {{an exploration of}} the state space of <b>S,</b> <b>checking</b> whether there exists a state where p holds. Since concrete state spaces (models) of timed systems are usually in nite, they cannot be directly applied to model checking. One of the solution to this problem is to exploit nite abstract models, preseving the properties of interest. The paper presents a new method of buildng abstract models for Timed Automata, based on a partitioning algorithm. Our pseudo-bisimulating models are often smaller than forward-reachability graphs, commonly used in reachability analysis.

The majority of trials have been too small to produce adequate evidence to inform policy. Despite {{the lack of a}} firm evidence base, UK primary care practitioners (general practitioners) are required to offer an annual health check to patients aged 75 years and over. Design Cluster-randomised factorial trial in primary care comparing a package of assessments (i) universal versus targeted assessment and (ii) management by the primary care team (PC) or a multidisciplinary geriatric assessment team (GM). The unit of randomization is the general practice. Methods Older people aged 75 and over eligible for the over 75 <b>s</b> health <b>check</b> and excluding those in nursing homes or terminally ill were invited to participate. All participants receive a brief assessment covering all areas of the over 75 <b>s</b> <b>check.</b> In the universal arm all participants also receive a detailed health and social assessment by a study nurse while in the targeted arm only participants with a pre-determined number and range of problems at the brief assessment go on to have the detailed assessment. The study nurse follows a standard protocol based on results and responses in the detailed assessment to make referrals to (i) the randomised management team (PC or GM) (ii) other medical services, health care workers or agencies (iii) emergency referrals to the GP.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Hospitality Management and DieteticsDeborah Canter and Junehee KwonThailand {{is one of}} the world’s {{most popular}} tourist destinations. However, it has not been {{successful}} in capturing and sustaining the U. S. travel market, one of the world’s top source markets by international tourism expenditure. The destination image (DI) is a key factor that affects destination selection, but there has been limited research exploring U. S. travelers’ DI of Thailand. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to measure U. S. travelers’ DI of Thailand and identify important attributes for U. <b>S.</b> <b>travelers</b> in terms of destination selection using mixed methods of qualitative and quantitative approaches. To explore American travelers’ DI of Thailand, personal interviews with 56 U. <b>S.</b> <b>travelers</b> were conducted at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Thailand. Maximum variation purposeful sampling was used to ensure diversity of the sample. One interviewer and a verifier ensured consistent and credible data collection and analyses. Data analyses included inductive, deductive and cross-case analyses. “Friendly People,” “Beaches and Islands,” and “Amazing” described Thailand's DI. First-time visitors had tourist attraction and activity-based images, while repeat visitors rated people and culture-related experience as top reasons for destination selection. Results from the qualitative study were used to identify common and unique attributes for the quantitative survey instrument. To access general perception of Thailand’s DI among U. <b>S.</b> <b>travelers,</b> an online survey was conducted with 522 international travelers including non-visitors (n= 173), virtual-visitors (n= 175) and visitors to Thailand (n= 174). Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and factor analyses were conducted. Of five factors that solidified the DI of Thailand, cultural attributes and local experiences represented Thailand’s DI the most. DIs were different among different types of visitors. Importance-Performance Analysis illustrated Thailand’s destination attributes and their importance for destination selection. For U. <b>S.</b> <b>travelers,</b> travel environment was the most important factor but had low performance.
