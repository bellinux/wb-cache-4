In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling {{to find out who}} committed the murder and how the crime was committed. Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is more <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> than meets the eye.|$|E

25|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> the {{substance}} of copyright in United States law followed the sweat of the brow doctrine, which gave copyright to anyone who invested {{significant amount of time}} and energy into their work.

25|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> {{the issue}} {{regarding}} the constitutional validity of same-sex marriage {{had been considered}} by several of the provinces' appellate courts, all of them holding that it was constitutionally valid.

25|$|Generally, {{interactions}} between GSH and other molecules with higher relative electrophilicity deplete GSH levels within the cell. An exception <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> involves {{the sensitivity of}} GSH to the electrophilic compound's relative concentration. In high concentrations, the organic molecule Diethyl maleate fully depleted GSH levels in cells. However, in low concentrations, a minor decrease in cellular GSH levels {{was followed by a}} two-fold increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} one of 11 {{decisions}} of the High Court referred to by the Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, as cutting down the Commonwealth's powers until they were futile and justifying the changes proposed in the 1913 referendum. The case however was not decided {{on the basis of}} the constitution, thus despite the reference <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> by the Attorney-General, there was nothing in the 1913 referendum that would have affected its outcome.|$|E

25|$|The factual {{circumstances}} {{giving rise}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> began on 31 March 1903 when Henry D'Emden, who was {{employed by the}} federal government as the Deputy Postmaster-General for Tasmania, gave a receipt for his salary to a federal official without paying the Tasmanian stamp duty on it. D'Emden was convicted in a Hobart court, and was ordered to pay a one shilling fine and seven shillings and sixpence in costs and if he failed to pay, imprisoned for seven days' hard labour.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Krishnamurti's once close {{relationship}} with the Rajagopals had deteriorated {{to the point where he}} took D. Rajagopal to court to recover donated property and funds as well as publication rights for his works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence, that were in Rajagopal's possession. The litigation and ensuing cross complaints, which formally began in 1971, continued for many years. Much property and materials were returned to Krishnamurti during his lifetime; the parties <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> finally settled all other matters in 1986, shortly after his death.|$|E
25|$|Since 2014, {{women in}} Turkey {{are allowed to}} keep their birth names alone for their whole life instead of using their husbands' names. Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> the Turkish Code of Civil Law Article 187 {{required}} a married woman to compulsorily obtain her husband’s surname after the marriage; or otherwise, to use her birth name {{in front of her}} husband’s name by giving a written application to the marriage officer or the civil registry office. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that prohibiting married women from retaining only maiden names is a violation of their rights.|$|E

25|$|Jordan frames {{provide one}} of the main Jordan {{algebraic}} techniques to describe the symmetry groups. Each Jordan frame gives rise to a product of copies of R and C. The symmetry groups of the corresponding open domains and the compactification—polydisks and polyspheres—can be deduced from the case of the unit disk, the upper halfplane and Riemann sphere. All these symmetries extend to the larger Jordan algebra and its compactification. The analysis can also be reduced <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> because all points in the complex algebra (or its compactification) lie in an image of the polydisk (or polysphere) under the unitary structure group.|$|E
25|$|After {{the case}} was dismissed, Hard Drive Productions was {{involved}} in another lawsuit related <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> On February 16, 2013, Nathan Abshire, one of the defendants in Hard Drive Productions, Inc. v. Does 1–1,495, filed a new lawsuit (MND 13-cv-00380) against Hard Drive Productions. Abshire alleged that after the disclosing of the Does' identities in September 2012, Hard Drive Productions, Inc. began harassing Nathan over the phone and continued to propose various unacceptable settlement proposals. The complaint primarily requested that the court issue an order declaring that Abshire not be liable for copyright infringement, that Hard Drive Productions's purported copyright on its work was unenforceable or invalid. It also requested that Abshire be awarded costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees.|$|E

A [...] "positive test" [...] or [...] "{{positive result}}" [...] generally refers <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> A positive result {{is not considered}} a diagnosis, since it may be obtained decades before the symptoms begin. However, a negative test means that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD. The test will tell a person who originally had a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease if their risk goes up to 100 percent or is eliminated. A person who tests positive for the disease will develop HD sometime within their lifetime, provided he or she lives {{long enough for the}} disease to appear.|$|E

Many missing persons were excluded as possible identities; authorities checked Shoshana Black, Paula Ramerez-Figuroa, Ofir Ben–Haim, Cassidy Gibbs and Ayla Reynolds. Other leads were pursued involving children that were reported missing, some of whom were foreign to the United States. Some of the potential matches were later located alive. The disappearance case of Sarah Hoggle had been analyzed to have a possible link to the case, yet investigators stated it was [...] "unlikely" [...] to have been related <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> In all, over two hundred missing people were ruled out from the case.|$|E
