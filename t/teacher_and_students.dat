The next year, more than 30 graduating Seniors in the school (including many student leaders) complained that Tech's curriculum was old and outdated. Their primary complaint was that the curriculum was geared toward the small minority of students who were not planning on attending college. In 1967 the schools of New York City got to view television in the classrooms for the first time, thanks to the station WNYE-TV, then located in the transmitter center on top of Brooklyn Tech.|$|E

Despite having English as its medium of instruction, the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students,</b> especially those with spoken ability in English, Malay and Chinese, often practice codeswitching, which serves many functions in conversations (Auer, 1998; as cited in Riehl, 2005). This paper examines the attitudes of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> to codeswitching in RIC, and the teachers’ and students’ perceptions of codeswitching as a teaching and learning strategy. Data was collected through nonparticipant observation, likert-type questionnaire, and short interview sessions. The participants of the study were 28 <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> 85 <b>students.</b> In addition to that, three teachers were purposively selected for conversation observations and interview sessions. It was found that codeswitching is natural, acceptable and inevitable in the context of RIC, that the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> generally have positive attitudes to codeswitching, <b>and</b> the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> have mixed perception of codeswitching as teaching and learning strategy, as well as a gap of expectation towards the practice of codeswitching in the contexts of the college. From the findings of this research, the researcher identified that codeswitching is used as a technique to scaffold the teaching-learning of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> of RIC. In conclusion, despite previous researches’ findings on codeswitching as a speech style, it is still considered as a strategy for the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> of RIC outside of classroom contexts to communicate and achieve their teaching-learning goals...|$|R
