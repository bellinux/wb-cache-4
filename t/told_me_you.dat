500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> {{have to give me}} all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do." [...] Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E

500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single, on October 29, 2001. The song was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song only managed to reach number sixty-two on the Australian Singles Chart. A music video, directed by Hype Williams, features Simpson dancing in a futuristic spaceship-like setting, with her backup dancers. A third single was planned to be released, but after September 11 terrorist attacks, Sony refused to promote a third single, which Joe Simpson believed critical for Jessica's prospects. In a interview in 2004 he said:"When those planes crashed into those buildings, it nearly demolished our career." [...] "When You <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me" [...] {{was released}} as a promotional single in Brazil. [...] The single however charted and peaked at number 192 on the South Korean Download Chart.|$|E

500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> were prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 {{days a week for}} you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E
500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|... "When You <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me" [...] {{is another}} power ballad about love, this time {{utilizing}} a spanish guitar. Backed by a full 60 piece orchestra, {{the song and}} Simpson's vocals were {{compared to that of}} Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. [...] "Hot Like Fire", which received positive reviews from critics, is a funky mid-tempo number. Compared to the likes of Michael Jackson and Destiny's Child, the song begins with a [...] "faux" [...] telephone call between Simpson and her friend; the latter explains that Simpson's boyfriend has been cheating on her. The lyrics, sung with [...] "hard edge vocals" [...] over synth horns, hip-hop beats, and electronica rhythms, demonstrate Simpson's annoyance at being cheated on by her boyfriend. [...] "Imagination" [...] is a song with electronic and R influences. Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal commented that the song contained Stevie Wonder-styled funk music. [...] "To Fall in Love Again" [...] and [...] "For Your Love" [...] are ballads; the former is backed by a 60 piece orchestra, and Peter Marsh of BBC Music noted it [...] "morphs [...] into an R'n'B tinged slow jam." [...] It also contains a jazz breakdown, towards its end. Bob Waliszewski wrote that through the latter, [...] "Simpson pledges devotion to a partner". [...] "I Never", produced by Darkchild, infuses Spanish guitars, and has an [...] "urban" [...] tinge. The song portrays the theme of self-respect, and has Simpson getting rid of her cheating partner. The closing track, the cover of the hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow", is backed by a gospel choir and [...] "praises God for watching over His children". Reviewers called it one of the standout tracks from the album. According to Kirsten Koba of PopMatters, Simpson sings it [...] "with a depth and passion that is lacking {{on the rest of the}} album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yankees Manager Joe McCarthy, {{struggling}} {{to control his}} emotions, then spoke of Lou Gehrig, {{with whom he had}} a close, almost father-and-sonlike bond. After describing Gehrig as [...] "the finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known", McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, the manager said, [...] "Lou, what else can I say except that it was a sad {{day in the life of}} everybody who knew you when you came into my hotel room that day in Detroit and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team.

2500|$|Singer turned {{producer}} Mario Winans, {{wrote and}} produced a song for the album called [...] "Wish Your Love Away" [...] where Norwood sings with angst for her lover [...] "who played her like a fool".

[...] "Do You Know What You Have?", helmed by Mike WiLL Made It, switches direction, with Norwood firing back at her love. In the lyrics she [...] "cuts down her man for failing to return her affections." [...] The subject content changes slightly on the Bangladesh-helmed [...] "So Sick", another record which was written by Garrett. On the song, Norwood addresses a lover who pushes her too far and [...] "violating her trust", it includes the lyrics [...] "How far do you think I'll let you push me before I cross the line?".|$|E

When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (文休), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, {{he came up with}} a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have {{received}} a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a [...] "reply" [...] as such: [...] "I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and you intend to defect to my side. I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you.

When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang. His subordinates became distrustful of him and eventually he was dismissed from office.|$|E
2500|$|Most Bond {{girls are}} {{apparently}} (and sometimes expressly) sexually {{experienced by the}} time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, [...] "They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone." [...] The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme (perhaps absurd) level in Goldfinger. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, {{but at the end of}} the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> only liked women," [...] she replies, [...] "I never met a man before." ...|$|E
