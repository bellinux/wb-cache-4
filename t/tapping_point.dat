40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} era of complex systems like avionics, {{industrial}} processes, electronic circuits, etc., on-the-fly or on-line fault detection is becoming {{necessary to provide}} uninterrupted services. Measurement limitation based fault detection schemes are applied {{to a wide range}} of systems because sensors cannot be deployed in all the locations from which measurements are required. This paper focuses towards On-Line Testing (OLT) of faults in digital electronic circuits under measurement limitation using the theory of discrete event systems. Most of the techniques presented in the literature on OLT of digital circuits have emphasized on keeping the scheme non-intrusive, low area overhead, high fault coverage, low detection latency etc. However, minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> (i. e., measurement limitation) of the circuit under test (CUT) by the on-line tester was not considered. Minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> reduces load on the CUT and this reduces the area overhead of the tester. However, reduction in <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> compromises fault coverage and detection latency. This work studies the effect of minimizing <b>tap</b> <b>points</b> on fault coverage, detection latency and area overhead. Results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits illustrate that measurement limitation have minimal impact on fault coverage and detection latency but reduces the area overhead of the tester. Further, it was also found that for a given detection latency and fault coverage, area overhead of the proposed scheme is lower compared to other similar schemes reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{an important}} technique for assessing the health of high voltage power transformers. A partial discharge signal within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding first, then travel along the winding to the bushing core bar. The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its <b>tap</b> <b>point.</b> Previous published work [1] has shown that these high frequency components at the bushing <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> can be detected using a suitable sensor and transmitted to remote digital equipment for on-line analysis. In a high voltage substation there is often excessive electrical noise which may corrupt any measured PD signal from the bushing <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> as the bushing acts as an antenna. If signal transmission is implemented using standard coaxial cables this can result in further corruption of the PD signal. The use of optical transmission techniques therefore has clear advantages not only through improved noise immunity {{but also because it}} realises electrical isolation and improved operator safety. This paper details the application of an electrooptic modulator to generate transmission signals over polarization maintaining optical fibre from the measurement point. The feasibility of this approach has been investigated using PD signals measured at the <b>tap</b> <b>point</b> of a 60 kV bushing, two different PD sources have been used and in both cases it was possible to detect PD activity above 40 pC...|$|R

50|$|The Hartley {{oscillator}} is {{the dual}} of the Colpitts oscillator {{which uses a}} voltage divider made of two capacitors rather than two inductors. Although there is no requirement {{for there to be}} mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal <b>tapping</b> <b>point</b> (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a bipolar junction transistor, FET, triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an inverting amplifier or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a junction FET (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus distortion reduction) can be achieved with a simple grid leak resistor-capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to diode conduction on signal peaks building up enough negative bias to limit amplification.|$|E
40|$|Water {{separation}} in an upward, inclined separation tube, with distributed tapping points {{has been}} studied, verified and modeled in this thesis. Phase segregation in an upward inclined pipe is widely occurring {{in oil and}} gas production flow systems, but using the phenomenon for a controlled phase separation is somewhat novel and requires the establishment of understanding of the governing parameters. The thesis research consists of two major parts; 1. Conducting laboratory experiments to validate the separation concept, to quantify its efficiency and to acquire data to develop the separation model. 2. Modeling the separation process analytically to establish the governing parameters and their significance. The experimental separation observations have been conducted on an inclined test tube with distributed tapping points. The test tube is 5 m long and is 0. 154 m in diameter, a size which minimizes diameter scaling-up to field applications scale. The tests were conducted at a low pressure with a mixture of two-phase, water and synthetic oil. In addition, certain experiments were conducted with low volumes of compressed air, simulating the small quantities of free gas flowing in and near the well. Variations of full scale separator length were studied by conducting an extensive matrix of test conditions on the short 5 m-tube. These tests results can be combined in a ”pancake” fashion to model the performance of a full-length separator. The core of the modeling is the establishment of an empirical drainage function per <b>tapping</b> <b>point</b> that relates the oil and water flow rates in the tube to the oil fraction obtained in the tapping stream. Once a single tapping performance is known and expressed in terms of separation efficiency, the total separator efficiency with multiple tapping points is calculated. The drainage function is based on a physical realization that there is a region, or a ”drainage volume” in the flow stream affected by the fluid withdrawal in the <b>tapping</b> <b>point.</b> The oil fraction in the tapping stream depends on this drainage volume and this dependency can be expressed by two factors; (a) the height above the draining point and, (b) a relationship that expresses how much oil is drained from each position vertically above the <b>tapping</b> <b>point.</b> These two relationships, which were established from the experimental results, were then used to assign a weighted oil contribution from each height {{from the bottom of the}} tube. When these weighted contributions are employed on the oil dispersion model, it calculates the compound effect of the dispersion and withdrawal to yield the tapping stream oil fraction. The dispersion model calculates the distribution of the fraction of each oil droplet-size class in the pipe cross section, and the distribution of the total oil fraction. The dispersion model is based on the balance of forces acting on oil droplets perpendicular to the flow direction. The applied forces are gravity, buoyancy, lift and turbulent dispersion. The model is unified. That is, it captures the oil distribution at all the observed flow patterns. The model has been used to study the effect of variation of the parameters that were kept constant in the experiments, such as water and oil density and interfacial tension and pipe diameter. In addition, the developed and tuned model has been tested for predicting separation efficiency in single and multiple tapping arrangements. The studied separation variables are; inlet rates of the fluids, inclination angle and diameter of the separation pipe, oil and water densities, interfacial tension, number of tapping points and distance between the tapping points. The results concluded that the flow pattern is the most significant factor affecting the separation performance. High separation efficiency is obtained for flow patterns with a water-rich bottom layer. This layer can be either upwards flowing, or a back-flowing film. The pipe inclination angle, the pipe diameter, water and oil densities and the interfacial tension are strongly affecting the flow patterns, and thus the separator performance. On the other hand, separation performance was not greatly affected by the drainage rate or the number of drainage points per section. Furthermore, as expected intuitively, the presence of air increases the turbulence and thus decreases the performance of the separation. However, it was also observed that in the presence of free gas, oil-water flow patterns with a thick, clear (transparent) and back-flowing water layer yielded better separation than the ones with upward flow films. In summary, the thesis provides a basic understanding of the process of separation in inclined flow using single and multiple tapping, gives information on the range of expected performance, and provides some fundamental knowledge for design and engineering of separators based on this principle.

40|$|A {{description}} is given of {{the installation of}} prefabricated, timber, flat-vee weirs to measure the discharge rates in the principal runoff streams from waste rock dumps at the abandoned mine site at Rum Jungle, Northern Territory. Details are presented of the <b>tapping</b> <b>point,</b> stilling well, stilling well/tapping point connection and the technique used to measure gauge height. The relationship between discharge rate and gauge head for the weir structure installed is discussed. The high gradient and high silt load of the run-off streams have led to silt deposition behind the weirs. Information is given on the silt levels and their effect of the discharge/gauge head relationship. The total error on the discharge from uncertainties in stream bed depth, uncertainties in the discharge coefficient and uncertainties in the measured gauge height, {{is estimated to be}} less that 10 % in the range 5 x 10 - 2 m 3 s- 1 to 0. 9 m 3 s- 1, the upper rate being just greater than the maximum discharge rate observed.

40|$|Near {{real-time}} {{continuous monitoring}} {{systems have been}} proposed as a promising approach for helping drinking water utilities detect and respond quickly to threats related to the normal operation of the water network. Water quality sensors may detect contamination events that pose a growing threat to public health, while pressure and flow sensors are used for estimating the hydraulic state of the system. So far, optimization algorithms for the placement of sensor nodes in water networks were implemented separately for water quality and hydraulic applications. Deploying two independent sensor networks within one distribution system is not a cost-effective approach, since an in-line sensor <b>tapping</b> <b>point</b> is expensive to install and maintain, and is bounded by physical constraints such as limited access to underground pipelines and/or power sources. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to consider a sensor network with a dual hydraulic-water quality monitoring capability (i. e., sensor nodes that collect both hydraulic and water quality data at the same tapping points). An additional benefit from this integrated monitoring approach is the possibility of reducing false positive detections of contamination events by associating abnormal water quality records with observable changes in the hydraulic data. In this study, a multi-objective sensor network placement model for integrated monitoring of hydraulic and water quality parameters using the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm- II method is demonstrated on two water distribution systems of increasing complexity. Tradeoffs between competing hydraulic and water quality design objectives are explored and analyzed. 2...|$|E

For total pipeline conveying characteristics, the shapes of the PCC curves and the location of the PMC were found to be significantly influenced by pipeline layout (e. g., location and number of bends) and not entirely by the dense-to-dilute-phase transition of flow mechanism.
