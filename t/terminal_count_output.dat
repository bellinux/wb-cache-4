40|$|The NB 7 N 017 M is a {{high speed}} 8 –bit dual modulus {{programmable}} divider/prescaler with 16 mA CML outputs capable of switching at input frequencies greater than 3. 5 GHz. The CML output structure contains internal 50 � source termination resistor to VCC. The device generates 400 mV output amplitude with 50 � receiver resistor to VCC. This I/O structure enables easy implementation of the NB 7 N 017 M in 50 � systems. The differential inputs contain 50 � termination resistors to VT pads and all differential inputs accept RSECL, ECL, LVDS, LVCMOS, LVTTL, and CML. Internally, the NB 7 N 017 M uses a> 3. 5 GHz 8 –bit programmable down counter. A select pin, SEL, is used to select between two words, Pa[0 : 7] and Pb[0 : 7], that are stored in REGa and REGb respectively. Two parallel load pins, PLa and PLb, are used to load the level triggered programming registers, REGa and REGb, respectively. A differential clock enable, CE, pin is available.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel method {{for assessing the}} maximum allowable PV generation on low voltage feeders. It identifies a relationship between load, total feeder impedance, <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> and PV generation at which the upper voltage limit for the line is breached. Identifying such a relationship alleviates the need for Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) to perform load flow calculations {{on a case by}} case basis. It also increases a DNSP's understanding of power flow in low voltage feeders and potentially enables them to develop improved strategies for managing PV on their networks. Using feeder models provided by a DNSP servicing the Australian city of Sydney's Greater West region, a substantial number of load flow calculations were performed for wide variations in feeder impedance, load and PV generation. The PV generation range is chosen such that a breach of the upper voltage limit occurs on the line. The feeder voltage profile from these simulations are analysed in Matlab to determine PV generation limits. For evenly distributed PV and load, results show a linear relationship between this PV generation limit and load for a given <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> and a second relationship between the PV generation limit and <b>terminal</b> <b>count.</b> It is then demonstrated that through the combination of these two relationships the PV generation limit can be determined for a given load, <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> and total feeder impedance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a new wide-range digital speed measurement method with jitter removal technique {{and using the}} direct memory access (DMA) <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> register (TCR). Our work also supports a multi node interfacing from different measure ends. The multiple measure ends are interfaced with DMA channels through pipelines to improve hit ratio. Here hit ratio indicates the exact identification of encoder pulses without any fail or miss. But the conventional pipeline system is facing problems due to improper synchronization of clock pulses. This is a universal problem in all the digital systems mostly called jitter or skew. Here a new system is implemented {{in the path of}} the clock to remove or reduce the clock skew. The jitter is also introduced in the pipeline due to different clock paths to the parallel pipelines. While one pipeline access the encoder pulses the remaining pipelines remain in idle state as single clock pulse is used to fed encoder pulses. And it creates a big challenge if multiple clock pulses are given to individual pipeline systems. This can be overcome using parallel ports as clock signals. The DMA method is based on both pulses counting in the constant sampling time at <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> stop pin of a DMA controller. The hardware configuration and algorithms for a microcontroller implementation are also presented. The proposed method is suitable in systems using microcontrollers with DMA controller and timers.

40|$|Wires {{have become}} {{a major source of}} {{bottleneck}} in current VLSI designs, and wire length prediction is therefore essential to overcome these bottlenecks. Wire length prediction is broadly classified into two types: macroscopic prediction, which is the prediction of wire length distribution, and microscopic prediction, which is the prediction of individual wire lengths. The objective of this thesis is to develop a clear understanding of limitations to both macroscopic and microscopic a priori, post-placement, pre-routing wire length predictions, and thereby develop better wire length prediction models. Investigations carried out to understand the limitations to macroscopic prediction reveal that, in a given design (i) the variability of the wire length distribution increases with length and (ii) the use of Rent s rule with a constant Rent s exponent p, to calculate the <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> of a given block size, limits the accuracy of the results from a macroscopic model. Therefore, a new model for the parameter p is developed to more accurately reflect the <b>terminal</b> <b>count</b> of a given block size in placement, and using this, a new more accurate macroscopic model is developed. In addition, a model to predict the variability is also incorporated into the macroscopic model. Studies to understand limitations to microscopic prediction reveal that (i) {{only a fraction of the}} wires in a given design are predictable, and these are mostly from shorter nets with smaller degrees and (ii) the current microscopic prediction models are built based on the assumption that a single metric could be used to accurately predict the individual length of all the wires in a design. In this thesis, an alternative microscopic model is developed for the predicting the shorter wires based on a hypothesis that there are multiple metrics that influence the length of the wires. Three different metrics are developed and fitted into a heuristic classification tree framework to provide a unified and more accurate microscopic model. Ph. D.
