40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} filtering short wavelength light on visual performance under <b>intense</b> <b>light</b> conditions among pseudophakic patients previously implanted with a clear intraocular lens (IOL). This was a patient-masked, randomized crossover study conducted at 6 clinical sites in the United States between September 2013 and January 2014. One hundred fifty-four bilaterally pseudophakic patients were recruited. Photostress recovery time and glare disability thresholds were measured with clip-on blue-light-filtering and placebo (clear; no blue-light filtration) glasses worn over patients’ habitual correction. Photostress recovery time was quantified as the time necessary to regain sight of a grating <b>target</b> after <b>intense</b> <b>light</b> exposure. Glare disability threshold was assessed as the intensity of a white-light annulus necessary to obscure a central target. The order of filter used and test eye were randomized across patients. Photostress recovery time and glare disability thresholds were significantly improved (both P< 0. 0001) when patients used blue-light-filtering glasses compared with clear, nonfiltering glasses. Compared with a nonfiltering placebo, adding a clip-on blue-absorbing filter to the glasses of pseudophakic patients implanted with clear IOLs significantly increased their {{ability to cope with}} glare and to recover normal viewing after an intensive photostress. This result implies that IOL designs with blue-light-filtering characteristics may be beneficial under <b>intense</b> <b>light</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of high-powered lasers to produce 50 - 100 keV x-ray sources for applications for programs such as Stockpile Stewardship and nuclear weapons effects testing (NWET). To produce these x-ray sources requires irradiating <b>targets</b> with <b>intense</b> laser <b>light</b> to efficiently generate high-energy electrons. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) of <b>intense</b> laser <b>light</b> produces electron plasma waves, which in turn generate high-energy electrons. To make a high-energy x-ray source, the maximization of this laser- driven instability is desired. Using computer simulations, we show that SRS can be driven by {{using a combination of}} frequency-tripled and a 'seed' beam of frequency doubled Neodymium laser light in a plasma of the appropriate density. Electron plasma waves with a high phase velocity are produced, which trap electrons and accelerate them to high energy. These energetic electrons will in turn generate high energy x-rays via collisions with nearby dense material. By adjusting the angle between the 0. 35 micrometers and 0. 53 micrometers laser beams, the characteristic temperature of the heated electrons (and the x-rays) can be varied. We show one and two-dimensional simulations and illustrate the important role that laser-driven ion fluctuations play...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutaneous {{hyperpigmentation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} cosmetically disturbing sequel of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. <b>Intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> is a promising tool for treating some melanocytic lesions. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effect of <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> in treating post-toxic epidermal necrolysis facial hypermelanosis. METHODS: Two Caucasian men aged 35 and 50 years presented with long-standing (32 and 39 years) severe hypermelanosis of the face after sulfonamide-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. They were treated by <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light.</b> Cutoff filters of 550, 590, and 615 nm were employed for five <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> sessions at 4 -week intervals. The treatment was characterized by energy fluence of 25 to 32 J/cm 2, pulse width of 2. 2 to 3. 2 ms, and double- to triple-pulse mode respecting a 30 -ms delay. Before <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> treatment, and 2 months after the fifth <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> session, clinical photographs and skin biopsies were performed in combination with quantitative narrow-band remittance spectrophotometry of melanin pigmentation. Patients were clinically followed-up for 8 months after the end of the treatment. RESULTS: In both patients, clinical, histologic, and spectrophotometric assessments showed an average of 80 % decrease in the hypermelanosis. No clinical recurrence of the hypermelanosis developed during the 8 -month follow-up after <b>intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> treatment. No major persistent side effects were experienced, especially hypopigmentation. CONCLUSION: <b>Intense</b> pulsed <b>light</b> appears to be effective and safe for treating post-toxic epidermal necrolysis hypermelanosis in Caucasian patients. Peer reviewe...|$|R
