5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E

5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> <b>and</b> in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E

5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> {{accounts for more}} than half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a {{separate}} non-profit organization operated by the Archdiocese of Miami. It {{is part of a}} national network of organizations that are operated in each U.S. diocese. This organization claims to be the largest nongovernmental provider of services to the needy in South Florida. It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. It employs over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. Some of these services include transitional housing, homeless shelters, elderly day care, child day care, addiction recovery, HIV/AIDS programs, family and school counseling, meals for <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> various immigrant and refugee help programs among others.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{their recent}} deterioration, village clinics have {{historically}} been {{an important source of}} health care for <b>the</b> poor <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> in rural China. In this paper, we examine the current role of village clinics, the patients who use them and some of the services they provide. We focus specifically on the role of village clinics in meeting the health-care needs of <b>the</b> rural poor <b>and</b> <b>elderly.</b> We find that although clinics are continuing to decline financially, they remain a source of care for <b>the</b> rural <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> poor. We estimate that <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> are 1015 percent more likely than young individuals to seek care at a clinic. We show that clinics provide many unique services to support <b>the</b> rural <b>elderly</b> (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> poor), such as in-home patient care, the option for patients to pay on credit, and free and discounted services...|$|R

5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> <b>and</b> a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
