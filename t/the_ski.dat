5|$|Events under <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup {{have several}} {{differences}} to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in ski flying also count towards <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely ski flying competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships, <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E

50|$|For the 1928 games, <b>the</b> {{cross-country}} <b>skiing</b> and <b>the</b> cross-country <b>skiing</b> part of <b>the</b> Nordic combined events {{took place}} around {{the hills of}} St. Moritz. Twenty years later, once again <b>the</b> cross-country <b>skiing,</b> <b>the</b> cross-country <b>skiing</b> part of <b>the</b> Nordic combined, and the ice hockey events took place in St. Moritz.|$|R
5|$|On 16 January at <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships in Kulm, Prevc became <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> flying world champion. The event {{consisted}} of three rounds as the fourth round was cancelled because of strong wind. He set two hill records during the competition.|$|E
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the hill}} and judge's tower started on 1 July 1980 and was {{completed}} on 1 December 1982. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> lift started on 1 October 1982 and was completed on 30 October 1983. The jumps were inaugurated in 1983. After the Olympics, Sarajevo experienced a boom in recreational skiing among locals, including ski jumping.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Ingham (1914-2000) was a UK pioneer and {{entrepreneur}} of <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> holiday. After World War II, Britain saw {{an emerging}} demand for organised escorted foreign holidays. He helped develop <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> marketplace in Britain and the [...] "package holiday".|$|R
5000|$|Like most of <b>the</b> Nordic <b>skiing</b> disciplines, <b>the</b> first <b>ski</b> jumping {{competitions}} {{were held}} in Norway in the 19th century, although <b>the</b> evidence of <b>ski</b> jumping in <b>the</b> late 18th century exist. The recorded origins of <b>the</b> first <b>ski</b> jump traces back to 1808, when Olaf Rye reached 9,5 metres (31 feet). Sondre Norheim, who {{is regarded as the}} [...] "father" [...] of <b>the</b> modern <b>ski</b> jumping, won <b>the</b> first-ever <b>ski</b> jumping competition with prizes, which was held in Høydalsmo in 1866.|$|R
5000|$|Downhill skiing focusses {{much of its}} {{attention}} {{on the development of}} skier techniques for smoothly turning <b>the</b> <b>skis.</b> This is used both for directional control as well as the primary method for controlling speed. When the skier is pointed down the hill, or [...] "along the fall line", they will accelerate. If the same skier points <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> across <b>the</b> fall line, or more radically, uphill, speed will be reduced. Using turns, the skier can control the amount of time <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are pointed down the fall line, and thereby control their speed.|$|R
5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> stadium close to <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011/12 season, Prevc {{recorded}} four top 10 finishes. In February, Prevc was {{a member}} of the team that won the first ever World Cup team victory for Slovenia at <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> flying team event in Oberstdorf, together with Robert Kranjec, Jurij Tepeš, and Jure Šinkovec. Prevc jumped 225.5 meters (which would equal the hill record) in the one-series event but fell hard after the landing and injured his shoulder. He required an operation which meant that he had to finish the season early and also missed out <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships in Vikersund. Although he missed the last five events of the season, Prevc finished 15th in the overall standings.|$|E
5|$|Much like in <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
50|$|The {{snowplough}} turn, {{also known}} as a wedge turn or the pizza slice, is a downhill skiing braking and turning technique taught to beginners. <b>The</b> front <b>ski</b> tips of <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are together and the tails wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible. To turn, weight is shifted from <b>the</b> downhill, outside-of-the-turn <b>ski</b> to <b>the</b> uphill, inside-of-the-turn <b>ski.</b> As <b>the</b> turn is completed, the old uphill, inside <b>ski</b> then becomes <b>the</b> new downhill, outside ski.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ski</b> jumping venue {{took place}} at Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E

The format went unchanged from the previous games, but the Albertville Olympics {{were the first to}} see the mainstream use of V-style. The large hill competition was won by Austria's Ernst Vettori, the normal hill event was won by Finland's Toni Nieminen and the team event was won by Finland. Nieminen, Vettori and Austria's Martin Höllwarth collected medals in all three events. In Nordic combined, France won a double with Fabrice Guy and Sylvain Guillaume in the individual event, while Japan won the team event.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E
