5|$|Newman's {{determination}} to make <b>the</b> <b>promenade</b> concerts attractive to everyone {{led him to}} permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available {{in all parts of}} the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were about one fifth of those customarily charged for classical concerts: <b>the</b> <b>promenade</b> (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.|$|E

50|$|Bagnères-de-Luchon {{is celebrated}} as a fashionable resort.

The road is lined with bars and restaurants.|$|R
5|$|In Harford County, high {{waves and}} {{the storm surge}} caused {{moderate}} flooding in areas, forcing 55 to evacuate along the Bush River and 12 to evacuate along the waterfront to Havre de Grace. <b>The</b> <b>promenade</b> boardwalk in Havre de Grace was destroyed. Moderate winds left 51,600residents in the county without power. Damage in the county totaled at least $12.5million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer.|$|E

5|$|To {{appeal to}} its broad {{consumer}} base, the Alrov Group presents changing exhibits of sculpture and art along <b>the</b> <b>promenade.</b> All {{the pieces are}} by local artists, and most are for sale. During the summer and Jewish holidays, the mall hosts free concerts, street performances, folk dancing, and family activities. During Hanukkah, a Chabad candle-lighting ceremony takes place here nightly.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{he might}} have had {{business}} with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson, his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Deck.|$|E

5|$|At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie {{confirmed}} {{that she was}} expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on <b>the</b> <b>promenade.</b> She {{gave birth to a}} son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood that the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, {{so that it would}} become an elevated park or greenway, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when the}} historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
5|$|In 2007–2008, <b>the</b> <b>promenade</b> hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at {{the smaller}} Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist {{unfettered}} to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making A Few Good Men into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
5|$|Speyer was a {{supporter}} of the musical arts and a friend of several leading composers, including Edward Elgar, Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy. He was chairman of the Classical Music Society for ten years, and he largely funded <b>the</b> <b>Promenade</b> Concerts between 1902 and 1914. His non-musical charitable activities included being honorary treasurer of the fund for Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition.

The series Little Britain had the {{character}} Emily Howard strolling along <b>the</b> <b>promenade.</b> Other brief appearances {{were made in}} the television series Agatha Christie's Marple, The Two Ronnies, French and Saunders and Foyle's War. A sequence of sketches that appear in each episode of Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, was shot in the old Jo Pip's / Cunninghams theatre venue on Seaside Road, which has since been developed into flats. The 1993 BBC drama series Westbeach was filmed on location in Eastbourne and surrounding areas.|$|E
