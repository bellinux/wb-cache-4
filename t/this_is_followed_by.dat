5|$|Between 814 and 816, Claudius {{also wrote}} a Chronicle. It {{begins with a}} letter to a priest named Ado. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a diagram of the {{genealogy}} of Jesus going back to Adam, accompanied by commentary. A final section, which was in fact composed first, chronicles the Six Ages of the World based mainly on Bede. Claudius expends much effort in dating the events of the Old Testament according to the Christian calendar.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> mounting and copulation.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 1,662 {{turbines}} at 55 {{offshore wind}} farms in 10 European countries produced 18 TWh, enough to power almost five million households.

5|$|Technetium {{also has}} {{numerous}} nuclear isomers, which are isotopes {{with one or}} more excited nucleons. Technetium-97m (97mTc; 'm' stands for metastability) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91days (0.0965MeV). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> technetium-95m (half-life: 61days, 0.03MeV), and technetium-99m (half-life: 6.01 hours, 0.142MeV). Technetium-99m emits only gamma rays and decays to technetium-99.|$|E
5|$|The fort complex, {{which is}} {{accessed}} from an arched causeway, {{leads to a}} large gateway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a large quadrangular open yard surrounded by palaces. These are Raja Mahal or Raja Mandir, Sheesh Mahal, Jahangir Mahal, a temple, gardens and pavilions. The battlements of the fort have ornamentation. Notable architectural features in the fort complex are projected balconies, open flat areas and decorated latticed windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{knockout}} {{stage is}} a single-elimination tournament in which teams play {{each other in}} one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.|$|E

In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E

5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Stanmoor lock was {{constructed}} above the junction with the River Tone, but {{all traces of}} it have gone. Next to the pedestrian bridge at Stathe four living willow cones, which were woven in 1997 by Clare Wilks, have now rooted and sprouted. Oath lock no longer functions as a lock, but the sluice is used to regulate the river levels. Below Langport, the river is crossed by a lattice girder bridge, carrying the Taunton to Westbury railway line, which approaches the crossing on multi-arched viaducts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the derelict remains of the Langport lock and sluice.|$|E

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|Texas has {{the most}} farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked #1 for revenue {{generated}} from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked #2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California. At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas' annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broilers at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement {{and its potential}} for the greater democratization of society. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third {{part of the book}} comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.|$|E

5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with {{a large amount of}} cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The report {{typically}} {{begins with}} an introduction, summarising the most significant birds occurring during the year, and discussing any current issues relating to the committee's work. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a list of accepted records in taxonomic sequence. Records for each taxon are listed by county, followed by comments about its occurrence during the year. Late-accepted records and decisions to reject a previously identified record are included. This section of the report contains painted illustrations and photographs {{of some of the}} birds. The report lists records that have not been accepted, often noting the most significant that remain under consideration.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
