5|$|In July 1941, Blenheims from Bomber Command's No. 2 Group {{joined the}} campaign. They claimed 104 vessels sunk and 72 damaged. Only 73 vessels totalling 178,000 tons were {{credited}} destroyed and 62 vessels, totalling 96,780 tons damaged. Intelligence in August 1941 saw this drop to 31 destroyed (73,348 <b>tons)</b> <b>and</b> 58 (148,000 tons) damaged. Post-war assessments reveal even this was over stated. Final figures were seven sunk (9,556 <b>tons)</b> <b>and</b> six (13,088) seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Route 232 Alternate Truck is a truck route {{around a}} weight-restricted bridge over {{a branch of}} Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township, on which trucks over 30 <b>tons</b> <b>and</b> {{combination}} loads over 35 tons are prohibited. The route follows Swamp Road, Worthington Mill Road, and PA 413. It was signed in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Production of bivalve {{molluscs}} by mariculture in 2010 was 12,913,199 tons, up from 8,320,724 tons in 2000. Culture of clams, cockles and ark shells {{more than doubled}} over this time period from 2,354,730 to 4,885,179 tons. Culture of mussels {{over the same period}} grew from 1,307,243 to 1,812,371 tons, of oysters from 3,610,867 to 4,488,544 <b>tons</b> <b>and</b> of scallops from 1,047,884 to 1,727,105 tons.|$|E
40|$|Approximately 400 paired {{measurements}} of total organic nitrogen (<b>TON)</b> <b>and</b> total organic phosphorus (TOP) {{were made on}} a hydrographic transect across Drake Passage by a uv photooxidation technique. Latitudinal variations in <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP concentrations were observed, with the continental margins having surface-water concentrations approximately 50 % greater {{than those in the}} centre of Drake Passage. This may be due to enhanced primary production on the continental shelves leading to increased production of organic nutrients. The vertical distributions of <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP were characterised by surface maxima, declining to approximately constant levels of about 2. 5 ?M <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> levels of TOP below detection by about 800 m. <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP can be related by the equation TON=(15. 7 ± 1. 7) TOP+(2. 48 ± 0. 17), r 2 = 0. 44, n= 397. This is interpreted as reflecting two weakly connected pools of organic material, the first a substantial refractory pool containing about 2. 5 ?M <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> undetectable levels of TOP, which dominates in deep water, and the second a surface labile pool containing <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP in quasi-Redfield stoichiometry. This relationship between <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP is not significantly different from a similar regression of data from the HOTS site in the central Pacific, implying that the composition of organic material, and hence the processes controlling its formation, are not substantially different in these two biogeochemically very different environments. Our postulation of two different pools of organic material with different chemical compositions and residence times leads us to suggest that the cycles of <b>TON</b> <b>and</b> TOP are more strongly coupled than is often thought...|$|R

5|$|The American {{data were}} {{analysed}} by Harold Van Buskirk in 1919. About 1,256 ships were painted in dazzle between 1 March 1918 {{and the end}} of the war on 11 November that year. Among American merchantmen 2,500 <b>tons</b> <b>and</b> over, 78 uncamouflaged ships were sunk, and only 18 camouflaged ships; out of these 18, 11 were sunk by torpedoes, 4 in collisions and 3 by mines. No US Navy ships (all camouflaged) were sunk in the period.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding {{turned a}} ship of 500 tons {{into one of}} 700 <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old carrack-style structure. By consequence, modern research is based mostly on interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of {{this version of the}} Mary Rose. The construction of the original design from 1509 is less known.|$|E

5|$|U-41 left Wilhelmshaven on 19 August 1939, before World War II began. Her first patrol {{involved}} traveling as {{far south}} as Portugal after entering the North Sea and circumnavigating the British Isles. During this patrol, two ships were captured: the Finnish Vega, of 974 <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> the 1,099-ton Suomen Poika. U-41 then returned to Wilhelmshaven, arriving on 17 September 1939.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of 1940, Coastal Command's Anti-shipping Operations (ASO) {{campaign}} against German seaborne trade in north-west European waters had claimed a direct attack on only six vessels, totalling 5,561 <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> 14 others badly damaged. In exchange, 158 aircraft were shot down or lost to other causes; 26 for every enemy vessel. Human casualties amounted to 600 men including 46 to 50 POWs. Coastal Command's performance contrasted heavily with the service' joint mine-laying effort with Bomber Command, that sank 86 enemy vessels in the same period, (totalling 82,983 <b>tons)</b> <b>and</b> ten others damaged for the loss of just 31 aircraft. The performance of Coastal Command's strike wings was down to poor intelligence and equipment, which it was refused, in favour of diverting them to other roles.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves - about 10kg of lithium per car. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found sufficient resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use. The study estimated global reserves at 39 million <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E
5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E

5|$|Both the Two <b>Tons</b> <b>and</b> Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 <b>tons</b> <b>and</b> were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber.|$|E
5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million <b>tons,</b> <b>and</b> revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E

5|$|Granat was a three-axis-stabilized {{spacecraft}} and {{the last}} of the 4MV Bus produced by the Lavochkin Scientific Production Association. It was similar to the Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 metric <b>tons</b> <b>and</b> carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its solar arrays. The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400W.|$|E
5|$|Gurnard rose to periscope depth {{two hours}} later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and {{equipment}} from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 <b>tons)</b> <b>and</b> Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) {{as well as the}} cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.|$|E
