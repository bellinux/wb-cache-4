5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

50|$|Some ELCBs do {{not respond}} <b>to</b> <b>rectified</b> fault current.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} of delayed-onset cavitation during ultrasound insonation {{have been suggested}} as being caused by {{a change in the}} size distribution of the bubble population due <b>to</b> <b>rectified</b> diffusion. <b>To</b> investigate this hypothesis, a single bubble model is used here to explore the effect of heating and the subsequent elevated temperatures on the rectified diffusion process. Numerical solution of the model, which includes the temperature dependences of seven relevant physical parameters, allows quantification of the change in the pressure threshold for rectified diffusion, as well as the importance of the bulk liquid saturation concentration in determining bubble evolution. Although elevated temperatures and liquid supersaturation reduce the rectified diffusion threshold, it remains coincident with the inertial cavitation thresholds at submicron bubble sizes at all temperatures. This observation suggests that changes in the nucleation environment, rather than bubble growth due <b>to</b> <b>rectified</b> diffusion, is a more likely cause of delayed-onset cavitation events...|$|R
5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{problems}} with the original design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, well after the initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543. The decision <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> the problems with the castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as the master of the works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman {{but he was}} not {{a prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers to a lack of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, in {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> this, the Ready Reserve scheme was established. Under this scheme the 6th Brigade, an {{existing}} Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time, was converted to a Ready Reserve formation. The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government.|$|E

5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys.

50|$|DTC {{has also}} been applied to {{three-phase}} grid side converter control. Grid side converter is identical in structure to the transistor inverter controlling the machine. Thus it can in addition <b>to</b> <b>rectifying</b> AC <b>to</b> DC also feed back energy from the DC to the AC grid. Further, the waveform of the phase currents is very sinusoidal and power factor can be adjusted as desired. In the grid side converter DTC version the grid {{is considered to be}} a big electric machine.|$|R

The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As {{a result of her}} different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive <b>to</b> <b>rectify</b> sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

40|$|The Au/n-ZnO contact {{behavior}} was investigated {{as a function}} of hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment of the ZnO sample by current-voltage (IV) measurement. The change from non-rectifying <b>to</b> <b>rectifying</b> performance upon etching was discussed in connection with sample characterization by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was concluded that the gain of the rectifying property was properly associated with the formation of a defective interfacial region at the Au/n-ZnO contact. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
