5|$|Borders and {{administration}} of <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> similarly changed {{a number of}} times. Originally, and for the initial period, <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization of <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|Most of Clarke's time in England {{was during}} the Interregnum, when rule {{of the country was}} under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector. Clarke's primary purpose there was to secure a {{strengthened}} charter for <b>the</b> <b>Colony</b> of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ensuring the religious liberties on which <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> had been founded, and Cromwell confirmed the validity of Rhode Island's 1643 patent. Clarke also assisted <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> in 1656 by sending home four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets, and in 1657 he handled a letter from <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.|$|E
5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers in <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> middle <b>colonies</b> were <b>the</b> Delaware <b>Colony,</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey <b>Colony,</b> <b>the</b> New York <b>Colony,</b> and <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Colony.</b> Their climate {{helped them}} become the 'breadbasket' of British North America. Arable land was {{plentiful}} and the soil was fertile. The excellent natural harbors helped <b>the</b> middle <b>colonies</b> become traders among <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> Due {{in part to}} immigration from foreign (Mainland Europe) countries, the people were ethnically and religiously diverse.|$|R

When the pair gain access to <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> they find a dishevelled Zakary who informs them that both he and Barzahl were unsuccessful in revitalizing <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> which remains a barren desert. He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will.

5|$|Another revolutionary, José Manuel Herrera, {{created a}} {{government}} on Galveston Island in September 1816 which he proclaimed {{part of a}} Mexican Republic. A group of French exiles in the United States attempted {{to create their own}} colony on the Trinity River, known as Le Champ d'Asile.

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the Boston Tea Party, the British {{government}} instated the Coercive Acts, called the Intolerable Acts in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> There were five Acts within the Intolerable Acts; the Boston Port Act, the Massachusetts Government Act, the Administration of Justice Act, the Quartering Act, and the Quebec Act. These acts placed harsher legislation on <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> especially in Massachusetts, changed the justice system in <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> made colonists provide for the quartering of permanent British troops, and expanded the borders of Quebec. <b>The</b> <b>colonies</b> became enraged at the implementation of these laws as they felt it limited their rights and freedoms. Outraged delegates from <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> united to share their grievances in the First Continental Congress in Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774 to determine if <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> should, or were interested in taking action against the British.

5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later {{claimed that he}} had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.|$|E
5|$|European powers {{ignored the}} area until accidentally {{settling}} there in 1685. Miscalculations by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River. <b>The</b> <b>colony</b> lasted {{only four years}} before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.|$|E
5|$|Henry Darnall died in 1711. Carroll {{took over}} Darnall's {{positions}} as agent and receiver general for the Calvert family in <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> both posts with significant additional salaries. Among the many uses {{to which he}} put this money was lending. After 1713, he became the largest mortgage lender in <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> and {{made a number of}} large personal loans to other planters. Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts. His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man in <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.|$|E

5|$|In 1634 King Charles I reorganized <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> into {{a system}} of shires. The former Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire. After persuading 105 people to settle in <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> Adam Thoroughgood (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King's Lynn, Norfolk, England) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the Lynnhaven River in 1636.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 Colonial Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act, which {{authorised}} fifty-nine {{new lines}} to almost {{every corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> and thus {{became known as the}} Octopus Act. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was also this decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three other lines following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s the majority of <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> was now covered in railways, {{with the exception of the}} Mallee country in the north west of <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> The Governor {{and a number of}} other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> Soon thereafter, the new leaders of <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.|$|E
50|$|By the mid 19th century, {{there was}} a strong desire for {{representative}} and responsible government in <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> of Australia. In 1840, the Adelaide City Council was established as the first city council in <b>the</b> Australian <b>colonies.</b> <b>The</b> Australian <b>Colonies</b> Government Act 1850 was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state. In 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte rule, new laws were created for <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> to replace <b>the</b> {{previous}} universal laws that applied to both France and <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> Napoleon Bonaparte rejected assimilation {{and declared that}} <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> would be governed under separate laws.

5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> had a number of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities.

5|$|The British {{expedition}} {{was led by}} Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone {{and sailed}} in April 1795, arriving off Simon's Town at the cape in June. Attempts were made to negotiate a settlement with <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August. A short battle was fought at Muizenberg, and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed. With Cape Town under threat, Dutch governor, Abraham Josias Sluysken, surrendered <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port. Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> {{only to find that}} it was badly outnumbered, and surrendered without a fight. The British occupation continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch.

5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> constituted a political system of division of power.
