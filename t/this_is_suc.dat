40|$|Fault-tolerance, {{which is}} a {{complement}} to fault prevention, is an effective method of achieving ultra-high reliability. By taking this approach fault-free computation can be achieved {{despite the presence of}} fault in the system. In this thesis three new fault tolerant techniques are presented and their advantages over well known fault-tolerant strategies are shown. One of these new techniques achieves higher reliability than any other similar techniques presented in the literature. Generally fault-tolerant structures consist of four major blocks: the replicated modules, the disagreement and detection circuit, the switching circuit, and the voting mechanism. The most critical component in a fault-tolerant system is the voter because the final output of the system <b>is</b> computed by <b>this</b> component. This dissertation presents a new implementation for voters which reduces both the complexity and the occupied area on the chip.

In this paper, we propose a new continuous time model to recover the volatility of underlying asset from observed market European option price. The model is a couple of fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations(see (34), (36)). As an inverse problem, the model is deduced from a Tikhonov regularization framework. Based on our method, the recovering procedure is stable and accurate. It is justified not only in theoretical proofs, but also in the numerical experiments. 1. Introduction. In the Black-Scholes framework one of basic assumptions is that the volatility of the underlying asset is known, and never changes.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{problem in}} inversion of geophysical data {{is developing a}} stable inverse problem solution that can si multaneously resolve complicated geological structures. The traditional way to obtain a stable solution is based on maximum smoothness criteria. This approach, however, provides smoothed unfocused images of real geoelectri cal structures. Recently, {{a new approach to}} reconstruc tion of images has been developed based on a total varia tional stabilizing functional. However, in geophysical ap plications it still produces distorted images. In this paper we develop a new technique to solve this problem which we call focusing inversion images. It is based on specially selected stabilizing functionals, called minimum gradi ent support (MGS) functionals, which minimize the area where strong model parameter variations and disconti nuity occur. We demonstrate that the MGS functional, in combination with the penalization function, helps to generate clearer and more focused images for geologi cal structures than conventional maximum smoothness or total variation functionals.

40|$|Many {{numerical}} {{methods for}} systems of convection–diffusion equations {{are based on}} an operator splitting formulation, where convective and diffusive forces are ac-counted for in separate substeps. We describe the nonlinear mechanism of the splitting error in such numerical methods in the one-dimensional case, a mechanism that is intimately linked to the local linearizations introduced implicitly in the (hyperbolic) convection steps {{by the use of}} an entropy condition. For convection-dominated flows, we demonstrate that operator splitting methods typically generate a numerical widen-ing of viscous fronts, unless the splitting step is of the same magnitude as the diffusion scale. To compensate for the potentially damaging splitting error, we propose a cor-rected operator splitting (COS) method for general systems of convection–diffusion equations with the ability of correctly resolving the nonlinear balance between the convective and diffusive forces. In particular, COS produces viscous shocks with a correct structure also when the splitting step is large.
