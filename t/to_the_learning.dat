500|$|Tippett's {{earliest}} compositions cover several genres.

Clarke observes that in these youthful efforts, characteristics which would mark his mature work were already discernible. Some of the early work is of high quality—the Symphony in B flat of 1933 was, in Kemp's view, comparable to William Walton's contemporaneous First Symphony. Tippett pondered for years whether to include this work in his formal canon before deciding that its debt to Sibelius was too great. Nevertheless, it foreshadows techniques that feature in the String Quartet No. 1 and in the Corelli Fantasia.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of reviewers gave Dota 2 highly positive reviews, a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome. While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve's product stability, Fredrik Åslund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota 2 {{as one of the}} most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career, citing the learning curve and players' attitudes as unwelcoming. Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> curve as a [...] "learning cliff", calling the newcomer's experience to be painful, with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful. In a review for the Metro newspaper, Dota 2 was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with the learning curve from Defense of the Ancients, as well as the sometimes hostile community, which is commonly criticized in multiplayer online battle arena games. Peter Bright of Ars Technica also directed criticism at the ability for third-party websites to allow skin gambling and betting on match results, similar to [...] with Valve's [...] Using Dota 2 as an example, Bright thought that Valve had built gambling elements directly into their games, and had issues with the unregulated practice, which he stated was often used by underage players and regions where gambling is illegal. Australian senator Nick Xenophon had similar sentiment, stating that he wanted to introduce legislation in his country to minimize underage access to gambling within video games, including Dota 2. In response to the controversy, Valve and Dota 2 project manager, Erik Johnson, stated that they would be taking action against the third-party sites, saying that the practice was not allowed by their API or their user agreements.|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, {{academic}} dishonesty {{undermines the}} academic world. It {{interferes with the}} basic mission of education, the transfer of knowledge, by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge. [...] Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process, which affects honest students as well. When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author's [...] "capital and identity", and if a person's ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Dewey was alarmed {{by many of}} the [...] "child-centered" [...] excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much {{reliance}} on the child could be equally detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process. In this second school of thought, [...] "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" [...] (Dewey, 1902, pp.13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.|$|E

2500|$|Skinner's views {{influenced}} {{education as}} well as psychology.

He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only {{in the presence of}} stimuli relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as [...] "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" [...] can be an effective reinforcer (Skinner, 1961, p.380). Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.389).|$|E

2500|$|In Europe, Charlemagne {{decreed that}} a {{hospital}} should {{be attached to}} each cathedral and monastery and the historian Geoffrey Blainey likened {{the activities of the}} Catholic Church in health care during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: [...] "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great Abbey of Cluny. The Church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied. The Schola Medica Salernitana in Salerno, looking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> of Greek and Arab physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.|$|E

40|$|Multi-metric {{learning}} techniques learn local metric tensors {{in different}} parts of a feature space. With such an approach, even simple classifiers can be competitive with the state-of-the-art because the distance measure locally adapts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> struc-ture of <b>the</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>learned</b> distance measure is, however, non-metric, which has prevented multi-metric learning from generalizing to tasks such as dimensional-ity reduction and regression in a principled way.
