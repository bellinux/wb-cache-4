5|$|During the 1911 {{football}} season Baker scored 92 points, {{a school record}} that lasted until 1974. Princeton finished the 1912 season with seven wins, one loss, and one tie in nine games. As the Princeton hockey team did not have its own ice rink, most of their home games were played in New York City at the St. Nicholas Rink, {{one of the few}} facilities in the world with artificial ice at the time. The team finished the 1911–12 hockey season with a record of eight wins and two losses in ten games. During his sophomore year, Baker was invited to join the Ivy Club, the oldest and most prestigious of the eating clubs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the center of social life at the university.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{was made}} a {{historic}} monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain inset as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the greatest risk of collapse. Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948–1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and {{the same year that}} the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the time the largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around the shop. There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{attracting}} the capital grew as people realized the commercial benefits and prestige <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> stake. New York City and Philadelphia each built houses for the president. State officials in New York offered to cede Kingston, while Maryland officials offered to cede either Annapolis or Baltimore. Also, {{as had been}} the case in earlier debates during the 1780s, regional biases, state pride and local loyalties were potent forces and figured into the contest. There was much maneuvering by northern and southern factions in favor of certain sites, and by interstate coalitions that were formed and dissolved almost daily, as Congress debated the matter during the spring of 1790. More than 20 sites were proposed publicly as candidates for the capital city.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Wilson {{was known}} for championing causes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> times unpopular, {{including}} {{the abolition of slavery}} and workers' rights for both blacks and whites. Massachusetts politician George F. Hoar, who served in the United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a Senator, and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson's reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his Senate career by his involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure. Several lawsuits were settled and corporate policies <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the center of the corporate disputes with the franchises were ended or amended.|$|E
5|$|British ships did not {{participate}} in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed 'Urabi's Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.|$|E
5|$|In Saw, Jigsaw {{has just}} {{concluded}} the bathroom trap of Lawrence Gordon and Adam Stanheight, {{an incident that}} occurred {{at the end of}} the first film. David Tapp, a police officer who had his throat damaged by Jigsaw's knife and was later shot in the chest by a suspect named Zep Hindle, has been healed and is brought to Whitehurst insane asylum, an abandoned sanitarium with a reputation for medieval tactics and frequent patient abuse. The asylum has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of the asylum consists of cells <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> one time used to hold the criminally insane. Jigsaw placed traps all around the asylum to continue his tests of will for Detective Tapp and his apprentice, Amanda Young, who monitors Tapp as the story progresses.|$|E
