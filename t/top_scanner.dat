Significant features incorporated in the Cloud <b>Top</b> <b>Scanner</b> design are: (1) flexibility and growth potential through use of easily replaceable modular detectors and filters; (2) full aperture, multilevel inflight calibration; (3) inherent channel registration through employment of a single shared field stop; and (4) radiometric sensitivity margin in a compact optical design through use of Honeywell developed (Hg,Cd) Te detectors and preamplifiers...|$|E
40|$|To aid in {{the process}} of {{evaluating}} print quality, five print quality metrics and methods to measure them have been developed. The attributes of interest are: (1) Edge quality, Sharpness, Detail, Raggedness; (2) Scatter, Particles, Halo, Character ghosts; (3) Readability, broken characters (4) Readability, touching characters; (5) Inverse text. The print quality is measured from a test chart containing typical text in a range of sizes and multiple fonts.

40|$|Protein microarrays {{are useful}} tools for highly {{multiplexed}} determination of presence or levels of clinically relevant biomarkers in human tissues and biofluids. However, such tools {{have thus far}} been restricted to laboratory environments. Here, we present a novel 384 -plexed easy to use lateral flow protein microarray device capable of sensitive (< 30 ng/mL) determination of antigen-specific antibodies in ten minutes of total assay time. Results were developed with gold nanobeads and could be recorded by a cell-phone camera or table <b>top</b> <b>scanner.</b> Excellent accuracy with an area under curve (AUC of 98 % was achieved in comparison with an established glass microarray assay for 26 antigen-specific antibodies.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel stereo vision {{technique}} for <b>top</b> view book <b>scanners</b> which {{provide us with}} dense 3 d point clouds of page surfaces. This is a precondition to dewarp bound volumes independent of 2 d information on the page. Our method is based on algorithms, which normally require the projection of pattern sequences with structured light. We use image sequences of the moving stripe lighting of the <b>top</b> view <b>scanner</b> instead of an additional light projection. Thus the stereo vision setup is simplified without losing measurement accuracy. Furthermore we improve a surface model dewarping method through introducing a difference vector based on real measurements. Although our proposed method is hardly expensive neither in calculation time nor in hardware requirements we present good dewarping results even for difficult examples.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of high resolution passive radiative remote sensing of the cloudiness volume in the atmospheric window between 10. 5 - 12. 5 microns is described. Airborne radiometers, the NASA/Cloud <b>Top</b> <b>Scanner,</b> {{were used to}} obtain radiances during several passages over two merging cumulus clouds, with the data being converted into equivalent blackbody temperatures. Data were also gathered in the 0. 55 - 0. 70 micron visible bands {{as part of the}} SESAME- 79 experiment. The number of points observed in the IR channel were adjusted to account for the viewing angle and areal extents were calculated. A relationship was assumed to exist between the brightness temperatures of the cloud surface and the level of cloudiness at a given atmospheric altitude.

40|$|Advances in {{molecular}} {{methods for}} analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins in humans {{as well as}} in other animals, plants, fungi, bacteria or viruses have greatly increased the resolution with which we can study life’s complexity and dynamics on earth. While genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic laboratory tools for molecular diagnosis of disease are rapidly becoming more comprehensive, the access to such advanced yet often expensive and centralized procedures is limited. There is a great need for rapid and comprehensive diagnostic methods in low-resource settings or contexts where a person can not or will not go to a hospital or medical laboratory, yet where a clinical analysis is urgent. In this thesis, results from development and characterization of novel technologies for DNA and protein microarray analysis are presented. Emphasis is on methods that could provide rapid, cost-effective and portable analysis with convenient readout and retained diagnostic accuracy. The first study presents a magnetic bead-based approach for DNA microarray analysis for a rapid visual detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the second work, magnetic beads were used as detection reagents for rapid differential detection of presence of pestiviral family members using a DNA oligonucleotide microarray with read-out by means of a tabletop scanner or a digital camera. In paper three, autoimmune responses from human sera were detected on a protein autoantigen microarray, again by means of magnetic bead analysis. Here, special emphasis was made in comprehensively comparing the performance of the magnetic bead detection to common fluorescence-based detection. In the fourth study, an immunochromatographic lateral flow protein microarray assay is presented for application in the classification of contagious pleuropneumonia from bovine serum samples. The analysis could be performed within 10 minutes using a table <b>top</b> <b>scanner,</b> and the performance of the assay was shown to be comparable to that of a cocktail ELISA. In the fifth paper, the lateral flow microarray framework is investigated in further detail by means of experiments and numerical simulation. It was found that downstream effects play an important role, and the results further suggest that the downstream binding profiles may find use in simple affinity evaluation. QC 2010071...|$|E
40|$|High {{sensitivity}} and high resolution have been pursued {{as some of}} the most important research goals for preclinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. PETbox 4, a new, fully tomographic bench <b>top</b> PET <b>scanner</b> dedicated for mouse imaging, was designed and developed in this work. The aim of the PETbox 4 scanner is to achieve very high {{sensitivity and}} produce high quality PET tomographic images for molecular imaging based biomedical research. Performance of the prototype PETbox 4 system was characterized using the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 4 - 2008 standards. Due to the different characteristics caused by the compact geometrical factors, PETbox 4 requires data acquisition protocols that differ from those optimized for conventional large diameter ring systems. In this work the energy window for data acquisitions with PETbox 4 was optimized using the Geant 4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) simulation. A lower level discriminator (LLD) of 350 keV was proposed as the optimized energy threshold. Pulse pileup is a common problem in multiplexed scintillator detectors readout by resistor divider networks. In this work, a new pileup rejection method named position shift rejection (PSR) is introduced. The PSR method is based on the detection of position shifts on event location as the signal is being integrated. Both simulations and physical measurements show that PSR performs more accurate rejection and avoids erroneous rejection and loss of sensitivity compared to the conventional leading edge rejection (LER) method. A new phoswich DOI Detector with crystal scatter identification capability is being designed and developed for implementation in a next generation small animal PET system at UCLA. Both simulations and measurements were performed to evaluate the characteristics and benefits of the proposed design. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the proposed detector is feasible and can potentially lead to a high spatial resolution, high sensitivity and DOI PET system...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: PETbox is a {{low cost}} bench <b>top</b> {{preclinical}} PET <b>scanner</b> dedicated to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mouse studies. A prototype system was developed at our institute, and this manuscript characterizes {{the performance of the}} prototype system. Procedures: The PETbox detector consists of a 20 × 44 bismuth germanate crystal array with a thickness of 5 mm and cross-section size of 2. 05 × 2. 05 mm. Two such detectors are placed facing each other at a spacing of 5 cm, forming a dual-head geometry optimized for imaging mice. The detectors are kept stationary during the scan, making PETbox a limited angle tomography system. 3 D images are reconstructed using a maximum likelihood and expectation maximization (ML–EM) method. The performance of the prototype system was characterized based on a modified set of the NEMA NU 4 - 2008 standards. Results: In-plane image spatial resolution was measured to be an average of 1. 53 mm full width at half maximum for coronal images and 2. 65 mm for the anterior–posterior direction. The volumetric reconstructed resolution was below 8 mm 3 at most locations in the field of view (FOV). The sensitivity, scatter fraction, and noise equivalent count rate (NECR) were measure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a 20 mT bench <b>top</b> MRI <b>scanner</b> with 25 mm field of view using a receiver based on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Applications include imaging of finger joints and small animal models. The very low field strength means that magnet costs are greatly reduced and the low fringe field means the system can be installed in areas not available to high field scanners. Also, chemical shift and susceptibility artefacts are negligible, and tissue contrast is potentially increased compared to high field. The imager uses a temperature stabilised, NdFeB permanent magnet with ferrite pole faces to minimise eddy current paths. The magnet does not require a power supply, so the short-term field stability is excellent, and there is no supply-generated interference. The instrument occupies an area of only 0. 45 m 2 and may be operated without any additional RF shielding. Proton NMR signals are received at 830 kHz using a tuned SQUID amplifier, cooled to 4. 2 K in a low noise liquid helium cryostat. Measurements made in a shielded room show that the tuned SQUID receiver's sensitivity exceeds that of a conventional room temperature receiver coil, or an untuned SQUID magnetometer, by at least 6 times at the same frequency. When the receiver is located in the imager; the performance is degraded by magnetically coupled noise from room temperature components. However, this noise already approaches the level of magnetically coupled noise from imaged tissues, and further reductions would be possible by relatively simple modifications to the gradient sub~system. Even so, phantom images acquired with the SQUID receiver exhibit up to 4 -fold SNR improvement compared to a room temperature coil, and in vivo-images of human fingers, acquired in less than five minutes, show a high level of anatomical detail with sub-millimetre in-plane resolution.

50|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.The choice of a probe will depend on the depth needed to be studied. For example, the superficial venous system (SVS) can be very well examined using a high frequency probe of 12 MHz. For patients who have thick adipose tissue a probe of 7.5 MHz will be required. Deep veins require probes of around 6 MHz whilst the abdominal vessels are better studied with probes of between 4 and 6 MHz. In summary, three probes are needed together with a <b>top</b> level <b>scanner.</b> Also, the proper use of the scannercalls for a high level of expertise, so that the examiner must be well qualified and experienced {{in order to give}} effective results. In contrast to arterial ultrasonography the wall of the vein is not relevant and importance is given to the hemodynamic conclusions that the examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report. (Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow and of the laws that govern the circulation of blood in the blood vessels). It follows that the examiner knowledge of venous hemodynamics is crucial, which can be a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field, who might wish to carry out these examinations.Specialized training in venous ultrasonography is not undertaken in some countries, which undermines best practice, mainly when varicose veins need to be examined.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. March 2015. Major: Dentistry. Advisor: Heather J. Conrad DMD, MS, FACP, FRCD(C). 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 45 pages. Purpose: To {{determine if a}} novel technique combining the attributes of a cement-retained implant restoration fabricated extraorally and delivered to the patient as a screw-retained implant restoration has the necessary strength to provide a clinically acceptable and predicable restoration. Materials and Methods: Thirty specimens were fabricated and tested in this novel implant restoration technique, in which stock abutment was scanned using a bench <b>top</b> laboratory <b>scanner</b> and 30 lithium disilicate full contour crowns were designed and milled. In the first experimental group, the occlusal access channel was prepared in a pre-sintered crown using new high-speed diamond burs in a high-speed handpiece with ample irrigation as to keep the specimen cool. The access channel was prepared by the same operator for every specimen and the diameter was recorded. The specimens were allowed to air dry for 48 hours prior to being glazed, fired and finished. In the second experimental group, the screw access channel was prepared after the crown was fired and finished. In the control group, no screw access channel was prepared. Each finished crown intaglio surface was silinated per manufacturer specifications and luted with self-adhesive resin cement to its corresponding stock abutment. The cement was allowed to cure for at least 24 hours before testing. Each specimen was individually mounted in a custom-fabricated testing fixture and tested to failure on a servo-hydraulic testing system for static and dynamic tests. Each specimen was vertically loaded at a dynamic rate of 0. 100 mm/min until failure and the highest force reached {{at the point of}} failure was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed by consultants from the Biostatistical Design and Analysis Center. Results: A total of thirty CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated and tested to failure. The first experimental group had a mean failure of 990. 64 N. The second experimental group had a mean failure of 1167. 65, and the control group had a mean failure of 188. 68 N. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the load among the three groups and because there are 3 comparisons, Bonferroni method is applied to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. The results show that experimental group # 1, experimental group # 2 and the control group are statistically significantly different from each other. The diameter of the screw access channel did not make a statistically significant difference, most likely because the difference among the diameter wasn't that great between samples. Conclusions: The null hypothesis stated there will be no difference in the axial force required to fracture a lithium disilicate crown with and without a screw access channel prepared. The results of this study support rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative hypothesis. The preparation of a screw access channel in a lithium disilicate crown has statistical significance and reduces the axial load capacity from a crown without occlusal access. The diameter of the screw access channel did not make a statistically significant difference, most likely because the difference among the diameter wasn't that great between samples...|$|R
