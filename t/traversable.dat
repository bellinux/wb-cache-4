5|$|Flight Unlimited is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the Bellanca Decathlon, Extra 300S, Pitts Special S-2B, Sukhoi Su-31 and Grob G103a Twin II sailplane. The game {{begins at the}} fixed-base operator (FBO) interface—a <b>traversable</b> 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of scale airplane models to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including Sedona, Arizona and Springfield, Vermont.|$|E
25|$|The area <b>traversable</b> in Inquisition is {{much larger}} than both Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, and is said to cover two {{countries}} and the land between. The countries are: Ferelden (setting of Dragon Age: Origins) and Orlais, with a land known as the Dales located within.|$|E
25|$|With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever {{he showed}} that <b>traversable</b> Lorentzian wormholes can {{exist in the}} {{structure}} of spacetime only if they are threaded by quantum fields in quantum states that violate the averaged null energy condition (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region). This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended negative energy. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through <b>traversable</b> wormholes could never engender paradoxes – there are no initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that any situation in a time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions.|$|E
25|$|Minimal {{coupling}} {{of general}} relativity with scalar fields allows solutions like <b>traversable</b> wormholes stabilized by exotic matter of negative energy density. Moreover, Modified Newtonian Dynamics {{as well as some}} bimetric theories of gravity consider invisible negative mass in cosmology as an alternative interpretation to dark matter, which classically has a positive mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} of {{the theory}} of general relativity have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the Schwarzschild wormhole, which would be present in the Schwarzschild metric describing an eternal black hole, but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross {{from one end to the}} other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as <b>traversable</b> wormholes, would only be possible if exotic matter with negative energy density could be used to stabilize them.|$|E
25|$|The Casimir effect {{shows that}} {{quantum field theory}} allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be {{negative}} relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, {{and it has been}} shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point, Many physicists such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and others therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a <b>traversable</b> wormhole. Miguel Alcubierre has suggested using the effect to obtain the negative energy density required for his Alcubierre Drive.|$|E
25|$|A {{plan for}} the New Zealand Company's new {{settlement}} of Britannia at Pito-one (Petone) had been prepared in England by Samuel Cobham. The key elements of his city were {{a large amount of}} flat land on the shores of a harbour, <b>traversable</b> by a navigable river. When surveyors arrived in 1840 on the Cuba led by Captain William Mein Smith, it was determined that the Hutt River was not navigable and, due to its tendency to flood, was not appropriate to support a major city. For these reasons the new settlement was relocated to the southern shores of Port Nicholson and renamed Wellington.|$|E
25|$|The city of Davis is {{a college}} town, with {{the ratio of}} {{students}} to long term residents estimated at 1:4. Also contributing to the college-town environment is the close proximity of downtown Davis to the campus' main quad—a {{matter of a few}} blocks, and 5- to 10-minute walk or bike ride. Davis' 15 minute distance from Sacramento provides it with both the isolation critical to fostering a college-town environment while also providing a lively and large metropolitan area nearby. Though the campus itself is vast, the entire community of Davis is relatively small and is easily <b>traversable</b> on bike utilizing Davis' extensive bicycle trails.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the metric}} {{proposed}} by Alcubierre {{is consistent with}} the Einstein field equations, it may not be physically meaningful, in which case a drive will not be possible. Even if it is physically meaningful, its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed. The proposed mechanism of the Alcubierre drive implies a negative energy density and therefore requires exotic matter. So if exotic matter with the correct properties can not exist, then the drive could not be constructed. However, at the close of his original article Alcubierre argued (following an argument developed by physicists analyzing <b>traversable</b> wormholes) that the Casimir vacuum between parallel plates could fulfill the negative-energy requirement for the Alcubierre drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} predicts that if <b>traversable</b> wormholes exist, they can also alter the speed of time. They could allow time travel. This would be accomplished by accelerating {{one end of the}} wormhole to a high velocity relative to the other, and then sometime later bringing it back; relativistic time dilation would result in the accelerated wormhole mouth aging less than the stationary one as seen by an external observer, similar to what is seen in the twin paradox. However, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at each mouth will remain synchronized to someone traveling through the wormhole itself, no matter how the mouths move around. This means that anything which entered the accelerated wormhole mouth would exit the stationary one at a point in time prior to its entry.|$|E
25|$|The Casimir effect {{shows that}} {{quantum field theory}} allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be {{negative}} relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, {{and it has been}} shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point. Many physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne and others, therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a <b>traversable</b> wormhole. Physicists have not found any natural process that would be predicted to form a wormhole naturally in the context of general relativity, although the quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest that tiny wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale, and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates. It has also been proposed that, if a tiny wormhole held open by a negative mass cosmic string had appeared {{around the time of the}} Big Bang, it could have been inflated to macroscopic size by cosmic inflation.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Kip Thorne et al. {{published}} work showing how <b>traversable</b> wormholes can exist in spacetime {{only if they}} are threaded by quantum fields generated by some form of exotic matter that has negative energy. In 1993 Scharnhorst and Barton showed that the speed of a photon will be increased if it travels between two Casimir plates, an example of negative energy. In the most general sense, the exotic matter needed to create wormholes would share the repulsive properties of the inflationary energy, dark energy or zero-point radiation of the vacuum. Building on the work of Thorne, in 1994 Miguel Alcubierre proposed a method for changing the geometry of space by creating a wave that would cause the fabric of space ahead of a spacecraft to contract and the space behind it to expand (see Alcubierre drive). The ship would then ride this wave inside a region of flat space, known as a warp bubble and would not move within this bubble but instead be carried along as the region itself moves due to the actions of the drive.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} {{solutions}} to Einstein's equations exist that contain closed timelike curves (CTCs), which allow for loops in time. [...] The solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever {{to occur in}} practice, and it {{remains an open question}} whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely. [...] Since then, other—similarly impractical—GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and <b>traversable</b> wormholes.|$|E

Feeling their way from Lababia Ridge they located a <b>traversable</b> path through the jungle towards the coast but on 20 June, 'D' Company came under heavy attack from two Japanese battalions from the 66th Infantry Regiment, amounting to 1,500 men, and for three days intense {{fighting}} followed before the Japanese were successfully beaten back. The Australians relied on well-established and linked defensive positions, featuring extensive, cleared free-fire zones.

Half of its area was covered by dense kangaroo grass [...] high, but in parts where there had been a build-up of silt, Kunai grass grew from [...] high. Rainfall was around [...] per annum. The Markham Valley was <b>traversable</b> by motor vehicles in the dry season, which ran from December to April, and therefore formed part of a natural highway between the Japanese bases at Lae and Madang.|$|E
500|$|The fort and fortlet at Castleshaw are {{situated}} on {{a step of}} Grindslow shale {{on the eastern side}} of Castleshaw Valley below Standedge, part of the Pennine ridge in northern England. From the site there are clear views up and down the valley, although it is overshadowed by higher ground on all sides. It is remote and exposed and lies along the Deva Victrix (Chester) to Eboracum (York) Roman road. The road crosses the Pennines at Standedge where the area dips and narrows, creating a <b>traversable</b> pass which would have been guarded by the Castleshaw fort. The nearest forts are Mamucium (Manchester) [...] to the west and one at Slack [...] to the east, both on the line of the Roman road. There was also possibly a fortlet or signal station at Worlow, between Slack and Castleshaw. The later fortlet is on the same site as the fort (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy V {{includes}} many standard role-playing elements {{as well as}} renovated features introduced in earlier Final Fantasy games. Players navigate from a top-down perspective; a <b>traversable</b> overworld connects the various towns, dungeons, and other points of interest. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, Chocobo, hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or airship, depending on the situation. Most towns contain scattered inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several side quests that become available as the story progresses. Characters grow in strength by gaining experience points from random encounters with monsters on the overworld or in a dungeon. Experience culminates in a [...] "level up", in which character attributes such as hit points and magic power increase. A menu-based management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character's selected job outside of battle {{as well as to}} save the game's progress.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, the USMC {{revealed}} {{plans for}} new V-22 weapons [...] "to increase all-axis, stand-off, and precision capabilities", {{which may be}} potentially operated by additional crew members. Armament increases are for enhanced offensive capabilities to special rapid crisis response task forces, {{rather than as an}} attack platform. The V-22 could be adapted for various precision weapons, including the AGM-114 Hellfire, AGM-176 Griffin, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, and GBU-53/B SDB II. Fuselage-based hardpoints would be used to clear the proprotors. In November 2014, Bell and Boeing conducted self-funded weapons tests using a V-22 equipped with a small pylon on the front port-side fuselage and the AN/AAQ-27A EO camera replaced with an L-3 Wescam MX-15 sensor/laser designator. 26 unguided Hydra 70 rockets, two guided APKWS rockets, and two Griffin B missiles were fired over five flights. The USMC and USAF seek a <b>traversable</b> nose-mounted weapon connected to a helmet-mounted sight; recoil complicates integrating a forward-facing gun. A pylon {{on either side of the}} fuselage can carry [...] of munitions.|$|E
500|$|Lyautey {{returned}} to his former position in Morocco {{at the end of}} May and immediately decided on a new strategy. [...] He concentrated his forces in the Moulouya Valley, convinced that the submission of the tribes in this area would lead to the collapse of the Zaian resistance. [...] In preparation for this new offensive Poeymirau established a French post at El Bekrit, within Zaian territory, and forced the submission of three local tribes. [...] He then used this post to protect his flanks during an advance south-eastwards into the valley, intending to meet with a column led by Colonel Paul Doury, advancing north-west from Boudenib. [...] The two columns met at Assaka Nidji on 6 June, a moment which represented the establishment of the first French-controlled route across the Atlas mountains, and earned Poeymirau promotion to brigadier-general. [...] A defensive camp was soon established at Kasbah el Makhzen, and Doury began construction on a road that he promised would be <b>traversable</b> by motor transport by 1918.|$|E
500|$|NY30 {{has been}} realigned in two areas along its routing. The first {{realignment}} {{was in the}} Schoharie Valley near the hamlets of Breakabeen and Fultonham. NY30 was originally routed along the base of Toepath Mountain near Fultonham and along a pair of village streets in Breakabeen. In the 1950s, a proposal was made to reroute NY30 onto a new routing {{in the base of}} the valley surrounding Schoharie Creek. The proposal was approved, and the new alignment of NY30 opened [...] The former routing of NY30 from Max V. Shaul State Park near Breakabeen to Fultonham, still visible from the modern alignment of the route, was closed to the public and guardrails were installed to stop motor traffic from using the route. However, biking and walking was still allowed, and the old highway is now a [...] trail known as [...] "Old Route30". The trail is not maintained; thus, the quality of the blacktop along Old Route30 has deteriorated over the years. There are significant potholes and overhanging trees, but the path is still <b>traversable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not <b>traversable</b> in both directions, their {{existence}} inspired Kip Thorne to imagine <b>traversable</b> wormholes created by holding the [...] "throat" [...] of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with exotic matter (material that has negative mass/energy).|$|E

[...] (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)

[...] Two such turrets were mounted on sponsons, {{one on each side}} of the aircraft.

2500|$|Kip Thorne and his {{graduate}} student Mike Morris, {{unaware of the}} 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov, [...] manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole {{for use as a}} tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of <b>traversable</b> wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of exotic matter, was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a Morris–Thorne wormhole. Later, other types of <b>traversable</b> wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by Matt Visser, in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure Gauss–Bonnet gravity (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of brane cosmology) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter. A type held open by negative mass cosmic strings was put forth by Visser in collaboration with Cramer et al., in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, what some {{physicists}} {{refer to as}} [...] "apparent" [...] or [...] "effective" [...] FTL depends on the hypothesis that unusually distorted regions of spacetime might permit matter to reach distant locations {{in less time than}} light could in normal or undistorted spacetime. According to the current scientific theories, matter is required to travel at subluminally Slower-than-light (also subluminal or STL) speed with respect to the locally distorted spacetime region. Apparent FTL is not excluded by general relativity, however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the Alcubierre drive and the <b>traversable</b> wormhole.|$|E
2500|$|Mini-roundabouts can be {{a painted}} circle or a low dome but must be fully <b>traversable</b> by vehicles. The idea is to allow motorists to drive over them {{in the absence of}} other traffic, but the {{practice}} is dangerous if other cars are present. Once the practice is established {{it may be difficult to}} discourage. Mini-roundabouts use the same right-of-way rules as standard roundabouts, but produce different driver behaviour. Mini-roundabouts are sometimes grouped in pairs (a double mini-roundabout) or in [...] "chains", simplifying navigation of otherwise awkward junctions. In some countries road signs distinguish mini-roundabouts from larger ones.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the war, the {{commander}} fought at a further disadvantage; the forward-opening hatch {{and the lack}} of a turret cupola forced him to observe the battlefield through a single vision slit and <b>traversable</b> periscope. German commanders liked to fight [...] "heads-up", with their seat raised and having a full field of view – in the T-34 this was impossible. Soviet veterans condemned the turret hatches of the early models. Nicknamed pirozhok (stuffed bun) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942 to using two hatches in the turret.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{solutions}} of {{the field}} equations of general relativity which describe [...] "warp drives" [...] (such as the Alcubierre metric) and stable, <b>traversable</b> wormholes. This by itself is not significant, since any spacetime geometry is a solution {{of the field}} equations for some configuration of the stress–energy tensor field (see exact solutions in general relativity). General relativity does not constrain the geometry of spacetime unless outside constraints are placed on the stress–energy tensor. Warp-drive and traversable-wormhole geometries are well-behaved in most areas, but require regions of exotic matter; thus they are excluded as solutions if the stress–energy tensor is limited to known forms of matter. Dark matter and dark energy are not understood enough at this present time to make general statements regarding their applicability to a warp-drive.|$|E
2500|$|With Anna Żytkow, Thorne {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} red supergiant stars with neutron-star cores (Thorne–Żytkow objects). He laid the foundations for the theory of pulsations of relativistic stars and the gravitational radiation they emit. With James Hartle, Thorne derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including {{the influence of the}} coupling of their multipole moments to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects. Thorne has also theoretically {{predicted the}} existence of universally antigravitating [...] "exotic matter" [...] – the element needed to accelerate the expansion rate of the universe, keep <b>traversable</b> wormhole [...] "Star Gates" [...] open and keep timelike geodesic free float [...] "warp drives" [...] working.

2500|$|In {{mathematical}} physics, {{a closed}} timelike curve (CTC) {{is a world}} line in a Lorentzian manifold, of a material particle in spacetime that is [...] "closed", returning to its starting point. This possibility was first discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1937 and later confirmed by Kurt Gödel in 1949, who discovered {{a solution to the}} equations of general relativity (GR) allowing CTCs known as the Gödel metric; and since then other GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and <b>traversable</b> wormholes. If CTCs exist, their existence would seem to imply at least the theoretical possibility of time travel backwards in time, raising the spectre of the grandfather paradox, although the Novikov self-consistency principle seems to show that such paradoxes could be avoided. Some physicists speculate that the CTCs which appear in certain GR solutions might be ruled out by a future theory of quantum gravity which would replace GR, an idea which Stephen Hawking has labeled the chronology protection conjecture. Others note that if every closed timelike curve in a given space-time passes through an event horizon, a property which can be called chronological censorship, then that space-time with event horizons excised would still be causally well behaved and an observer {{might not be able to}} detect the causal violation.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the theory}} of special {{relativity}} forbids objects to have a relative velocity greater than light speed, and general relativity reduces to special relativity in a local sense (in small regions of spacetime where curvature is negligible), general relativity does allow the space between distant objects to expand {{in such a way}} that they have a [...] "recession velocity" [...] which exceeds the speed of light, and it is thought that galaxies which are at a distance of more than about 14 billion light-years from us today have a recession velocity which is faster than light. Miguel Alcubierre [...] that it would be possible to create an Alcubierre drive, in which a ship would be enclosed in a [...] "warp bubble" [...] where the space at the front of the bubble is rapidly contracting and the space at the back is rapidly expanding, with the result that the bubble can reach a distant destination much faster than a light beam moving outside the bubble, but without objects inside the bubble locally traveling faster than light. However, several objections raised against the Alcubierre drive appear to rule out the possibility of actually using it in any practical fashion. Another possibility predicted by general relativity is the <b>traversable</b> wormhole, which could create a shortcut between arbitrarily distant points in space. As with the Alcubierre drive, travelers moving through the wormhole would not locally move faster than light travelling through the wormhole alongside them, but they would be able to reach their destination (and return to their starting location) faster than light traveling outside the wormhole.|$|E
2500|$|By the Neolithic Revolution, {{during the}} {{introduction}} of grain-based agriculture, {{people all over the}} world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or [...] "cool fires", as opposed to uncontrolled [...] "hot fires", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests <b>traversable.</b> Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture.
