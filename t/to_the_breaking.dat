5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E

Since 1977, {{players from the}} Negro Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced {{the formation of a}} Committee on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro Leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.|$|E

5|$|The {{island has}} been {{occupied}} since the Mesolithic period, {{and its history}} includes a time of Norse rule and {{a long period of}} domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th century Jacobite risings led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001. About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.|$|E

25|$|The wave peel {{angle is}} one of the main {{constituents}} of a potential surfing wave.

The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).|$|E

25|$|Surfers' {{skills are}} tested by {{their ability to}} control their board in {{difficult}} conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> wave) and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the floater (riding {{on top of the}} breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence that}} heterologous sequences of different sizes have on the frequency of double-strand-break repair by gene conversion in Drosophila melanogaster. We induced a double-strand break on one X chromosome in female flies by P-element excision. These flies contained heterologous insertions of various sizes located 238 bp from <b>the</b> <b>break</b> site in cis or in trans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break,</b> or both. We observed {{a significant decrease in}} double-strand-break repair with large heterologous insertions located either in cis or in trans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>break.</b> Reestablishing <b>the</b> homology by including the same heterologous sequence in cis and in trans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> double-strand <b>break</b> restored <b>the</b> frequency of gene conversion to wild-type levels. In one instance, an allelic nonhomologous insertion completely abolished repair by homologous recombination. The results show that the repair of a double-strand break by gene conversion requires chromosome pairing in the local region of <b>the</b> double-strand <b>break...</b>|$|R

25|$|On March 24, 1865, the {{day before}} the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, Grant already had planned an {{offensive}} for March 29, 1865. The objective was to draw the Confederates out into an open battle where they might be defeated and their military effectiveness destroyed. In the alternative, if the Confederates held their lines, the Union force could cut the remaining road and railroad supply and communication routes, the South Side Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, which connected with the previously severed Weldon Railroad to Petersburg, and the Richmond and Danville Railroad to Richmond, and to stretch Lee's line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> point.|$|E
25|$|Grant's {{strategy}} was to destroy or cut off sources of supply and sever supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond, which also would result in extending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> point the defensive lines of the outnumbered and declining Confederate force. In pursuit of these objectives, Grant launched five more offensives at Petersburg during the remaining months of 1864, another in February 1865, and two more {{at the end of}} March and beginning of April 1865. During the fall of 1864 and the winter of 1864–1865, Grant slowly extended the Union Army line south of Petersburg westward. Lee extended the Confederate line to match the Union moves, but the defenders were stretched increasingly thin.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 the Canadian {{government}} {{declared a}} moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery that, for the past 500 years, had largely shaped the lives and communities of Canada's eastern coast. The interplay between fishing societies and the resources on which they depend is palpable {{to even the most}} unacquainted observer: fisheries transform the ecosystem, which in turn pushes the fishery and society to adapt. In the summer of 1992, when the Northern Cod biomass fell to one percent of its earlier level, it became apparent to Canada's federal government that this relationship had been pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> point and a moratorium was declared, ending the region's half-millennium run with the Northern Cod.|$|E

25|$|Adding {{water to}} silica drops its melting point by around 800°C due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of the {{structure}} by replacing Si–O–Si linkages with terminating Si–OH groups. Increasing water concentration results {{in the formation of}} hydrated silica gels and colloidal silica dispersions. Many hydrates and silicic acids exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula n, similar to the behaviour of boron, aluminium, and iron, among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as orthosilicic acid Si(OH)4 and metasilicic acid SiO(OH)2, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.|$|E
25|$|Sky News objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> of its monopoly, {{complaining}} about {{the costs associated with}} running a channel that only a minority could view from the licence fee. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the European Commission ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the licence fee should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.|$|E
