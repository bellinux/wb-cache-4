5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> <b>country</b> with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

The work also considered factors that {{have resulted in the}} underdevelopment of <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> <b>countries.</b> These factors were identified as human resource development and corruption.

The verdict was that, the density of <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> lies in their own hands. Their development cannot be trace to any event present or future.

Tenacity in the face of difficulty can be found in every character the player interacts with in the game, where despite [...] "each one surviving through varying degrees of hardship, they describe their problems not with bitterness but with an undertone of perseverance" [...] and a certain [...] "burning desire to be happy" [...] notwithstanding their deteriorating surroundings. Damas describes Sukeban Games' titles as [...] "dramedies", or a fusion of drama and comedy, as they feel it is something the game industry lacks and [...] "laughter in the middle of despair" [...] sums up their experiences of living in Venezuela. Ortiz and Damas noted that, compared to these real-life experiences, such as when a friend had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to escape the protests in San Cristóbal, [...] "VA-11 HALL-A is kind of tame in comparison". Two in-game apps, the [...] "danger/u/" [...] textboard and the [...] "Augmented Eye" [...] news site, mirrors much of Venezuela's problems into the game's world. Damas explained how they wished to create a more [...] "optimistic kind of dystopia", where the player is just [...] "a normal person living in an interesting future". Additionally, since VA-11 HALL-A is primarily about interaction with characters, the objective of the game is not to save the world but rather to become a part of it.|$|E

However, an analysis of community based tourism and development brings to light another driving force which is paramount to development strategies in the difficult conditions of <b>third</b> <b>world</b> countries: this driving force is "place revitalization".
