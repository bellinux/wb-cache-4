5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US1-9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was {{designated}} as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US1-9 <b>Truck</b> <b>was</b> designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{department}} ordered a rescue truck for $194,448 ($ today) from 3-D Manufacturing, and a Pierce pumper <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> purchased at $312,777 ($ today) for Scarborough to replace their corroding 1974 Mack truck. A year later, {{the department}} hosted the Westchester County Volunteer Firemen Association Convention, the usual parade with 43 departments, a golf outing, {{and the annual}} meeting and dinner of the Association. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, the department sent some of its engines to the Bronx to cover for units that had left for the World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Sognsvann Line {{was closed}} {{during the summer}} {{vacations}} due to improvements of the track and third rail. In 2008, the line was closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that had covered the tracks. The operation of the line was replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsjå over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one-way-traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had to stop at Berg in the meantime.|$|E

The <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch.|$|R
50|$|Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin Trucks (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin Trucks. RKP trucks tend to hold {{traction}} {{better and}} {{are easier to}} handle at speed, whereas TKP <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height. Other forms of <b>trucks</b> have <b>been</b> seen in downhill but remain on the sidelines. These would include torsion trucks (seismic) and CAM trucks (Other Planet). Downhill <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> the economical choice {{as well as the}} most common, although Precision <b>Trucks</b> <b>are</b> becoming more common. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable. Due to the casting process cast trucks have 'slop' which is caused by small gaps in between parts. This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels. Precision trucks can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally. Precision <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} non {{centralized}} sanitation systems {{are served by}} vacuum <b>trucks.</b> They <b>are</b> used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems. The <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used in the cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. Vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to collect waste from airplane toilets.|$|R
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the {{situation}} remained tense in Tawau. A {{group of eight}} Indonesians were detained while trying to poison the water supply of the town. On 12 May 1964, there was a bombing attempt on the Kong Fah cinema. At the end of January 1965, a night time curfew was imposed in Tawau to prevent attackers from contacting the approximate 16,000 Indonesians living there. By the end of February 1965, 96 of the 128 Indonesian volunteers had been killed or captured, around 20 successfully retreated to Indonesia, and 12 remained at large. On 28 June 1965, an attempt by Indonesian troops to invade eastern Sebatik was repelled by a heavy bombardment by Australian destroyer HMAS Yarra. In August 1965, an unknown assailant made an attempt {{to blow up a}} high-tension electricity pylon while in September 1965, a logging <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by a land mine.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace {{the route of the}} Ford van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31am {{on the morning of the}} explosion.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army quickly {{deemed the}} French {{experiment}} a failure. It reassigned 7 Independent Company in late November to Marymount Mission, a small settlement {{to the east}} of Rusambo where there was a minor police station. The number of patrols they would embark on was reduced. Two of the company's vehicles were ambushed by cadres between Marymount and Rusambo on 6 January 1978, resulting in two men being injured, one fatally so. A week later another <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> surprised on the same bush road, resulting in one death and three serious casualties. The company was brought back from the bush four days later for rest and recuperation (R) in Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected {{about two-thirds of}} Mexico. The rains from Ingrid caused flooding and landslides across Mexico, causing many rivers to rise, and isolating towns. In Veracruz alone, the rains flooded 68rivers, which damaged 121roads and 31bridges, including two destroyed bridges. About 14,000houses were damaged to some degree. Heavy rainfall forced 23,000people to evacuate their homes, 9,000of whom went to emergency shelters, some forced to leave by the Mexican army in high risk areas. Evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to the houses of friends and family. Also in Veracruz, flooding killed about 20,000livestock. Along the coast of Tamaulipas, damage occurred from Soto la Marina to La Pesca. The Pánuco River in Tamaulipas rose above its banks, flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads. Also in the state, the storm damaged local sorghum fields. Two {{people in the state}} required rescue after their <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> swept away by a river.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road.

Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> not injured.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35inches (161mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from {{four days of}} rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20homes were destroyed, and 20villages were left without power. A transport vehicle carrying 15people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> later rescued by police workers. About 300hectares (740acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended. Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000people, and initially there were two people missing; however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.|$|E
5|$|The truck-mounted Katyushas were {{installed}} on ZiS-6 6×4 trucks, {{as well as}} the two-axle ZiS-5 and ZiS-5V. In 1941, a small number of BM-13 launchers were mounted on STZ-5 artillery tractors. A few were also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV-1K, but this was a needless waste of heavy armour. Starting in 1942, they were also mounted on various British, Canadian and U.S. Lend-Lease trucks, in which case they were sometimes referred to as BM-13S. The cross-country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½ ton <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> so good that it became the GAU's standard mounting in 1943, designated BM-13N (normalizovanniy, 'standardized'), and more than 1,800 of this model were manufactured by the end of World War II.

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
