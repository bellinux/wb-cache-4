5000|$|Vermaports level carts {{using three}} valleys. Specialized carts have their front wheels set closer {{together}} and thus not {{in line with}} <b>the</b> back, outset, <b>wheels.</b> For upwards travel, <b>the</b> <b>inset</b> <b>wheels</b> glide along <b>the</b> center valley, <b>the</b> outset <b>wheels</b> ride on <b>the</b> two higher outer valleys. This allows the shopping cart to stay level along an inclined path. On the way down, the center valley is higher and the side valleys are lower to allow the cart to transport level while facing down. Due to these valleys, shopping carts on the Vermaport SC {{do not have the}} typical plastic or metal grate shelf below the basket of the shopping cart that is used to carry large or bulk items.|$|R

50|$|A wheel, {{mirror and}} a light {{can be used to}} {{visualize}} real and imaginary described in this equation. The mirror is placed at a 45 degree angle above <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> so that you can see the front and top of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> at <b>the</b> same time. The light is attached to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> so that you can see <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> when <b>the</b> room lights are turned off. You sit directly in front of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> while a friend rotates <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> view of the front of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (real) and <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (imaginary) tell you the position of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{overshot}} <b>wheel</b> was a later {{innovation in}} waterwheels and was around {{two and a}} half times more efficient than the undershot. <b>The</b> undershot <b>wheel,</b> in which <b>the</b> main water <b>wheel</b> is simply set into the flow of the mill race, suffers from an inherent inefficiency stemming from the fact that <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, entering <b>the</b> water behind the main thrust of the flow driving <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> followed by <b>the</b> lift of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> out of <b>the</b> water ahead of the main thrust, actually impedes its own operation. <b>The</b> overshot <b>wheel</b> solves this problem by bringing the water flow to the top of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water fills buckets built into <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> rather than <b>the</b> simple paddle <b>wheel</b> design of undershot <b>wheels.</b> As <b>the</b> buckets fill, the weight of the water starts to turn <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water spills out of the bucket on the down side into a spillway leading back to river. Since <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself is set above the spillway, the water never impedes the speed of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> impulse of the water on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is also harnessed in addition to the weight of the water once in <b>the</b> buckets. Overshot <b>wheels</b> require <b>the</b> construction of a dam on the river above the mill and a more elaborate millpond, sluice gate, mill race and spillway or tailrace.|$|R
5000|$|Balance Truing Caliper: This {{device was}} used in {{fashioning}} <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> and gearwork of the clock, to make sure <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> particularly <b>the</b> balance <b>wheel</b> was balanced and circular. The pivots of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> were mounted in the caliper. An index arm was moved next to the edge and <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> was spun {{to see if the}} edge was true.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machine is}} {{shaped like a}} large, closed letter [...] "C". At {{the ends of the}} C, there are two <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> on <b>the</b> top is called <b>the</b> rolling <b>wheel,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> on <b>the</b> bottom is called <b>the</b> anvil <b>wheel.</b> (Some {{references}} refer to <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> by their position: upper wheel and lower <b>wheel.)</b> <b>The</b> anvil <b>wheel</b> usually has a smaller radius than <b>the</b> rolling <b>wheel.</b> Although larger machines exist, <b>the</b> rolling <b>wheel</b> is usually 8 cm (3 inches) wide or less, and usually 25 cm (9 inches) in diameter, or less.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> larger driving <b>wheel</b> for {{travelling}} in {{a forward}} direction, and a trailing {{steering wheel and}} 90 degrees to this one. Both <b>the</b> drive <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' <b>wheels</b> that allow <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> to be moved laterally. When moving forward <b>the</b> main <b>wheel</b> will be powered and <b>the</b> smaller planet <b>wheels</b> on <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> will rotate to avoid <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> dragging. To turn <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, <b>the</b> planet <b>wheels</b> on <b>the</b> drive <b>wheel</b> will be powered appropriately.|$|R
5000|$|True <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> by {{knocking}} abrasive particles from <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> surface and making <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> concentric. This minimizes vibration and improves surface finish, eliminating the vibration of <b>the</b> out-of-balance <b>wheel</b> across <b>the</b> workpiece's surface. It {{is not unusual}} for grinding wheels to become out of round with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> surveyor's <b>wheel</b> {{is marked}} in {{fractional}} increments of revolution from a reference position. Thus its current position {{can be represented}} as {{a fraction of a}} revolution from this reference. If <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> rotated a full turn (360 angular degrees), the distance traveled would be equal to the circumference of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> Otherwise, <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> traveled is <b>the</b> circumference of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> multiplied by <b>the</b> fraction of a full turn. In the figure on the right, the blue line is the reference starting point.

During the play, when <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> offense is in the 1-3-1 formation, it can also switch to other plays {{based on the same}} formation. This greatly increases the variation of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> offense, making it very hard to defend.|$|R

Then the tooth slides off the end of the pallet, beginning the cycle again.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an equation based model to simulate the combined heat and mass transfer in <b>the</b> desiccant <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> performance model is one dimensional in the axial direction. It applies a lumped formulation in the thickness direction of the desiccant and the substrate. The boundary conditions of this problem represent the inlet outside/process and building exhaust/regeneration air conditions as well as the adiabatic condition of the two ends of the desiccant composite. The solutions of this model are iterated until <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> reaches periodic steady state operation. The modeling results are obtained as the changes of the outside/process and building exhaust/regeneration air conditions along <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> depth and <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation. This performance model relates <b>the</b> <b>wheel’s</b> design parameters, such as <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> dimension, <b>the</b> channel size and the desiccant properties, and <b>the</b> <b>wheel’s</b> operating variables, such as the rotary speed and the regeneration air flowrate, to its operating performance. The impact of some practical issues, such as wheel purge, residual water in the desiccant and <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> supporting structure, on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> performance has also been investigated...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> freeing <b>the</b> splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> on <b>the</b> right side of the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> becomes loose <b>the</b> tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> securely.|$|R
50|$|The {{new feature}} of Wheel of Fortune is <b>the</b> namesake <b>wheel,</b> which takes <b>the</b> {{place of the}} {{starting}} tile. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> consists {{of a number of}} spaces, and players, in place of placing followers on the tile they just played, may place tiles on spaces along the rim of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> Each space on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> may have one or two spaces on the rim. In addition, a pig-shaped marker begins on <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> and is moved whenever a tiles with certain markings are drawn. When these tiles are drawn, the marker is advanced clockwise along <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>the</b> number of spaces stated on the tile. The space on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is resolved, and followers {{on the rim of the}} particular space are scored, before the tile is placed. Wheel effects include scoring by all players for certain types of followers (including unplayed followers), scoring by only the player on move, or the removal of a follower on the board (except on <b>the</b> <b>wheel)</b> by all players. Followers on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> score three points, except when there is only one follower on a wheel space that has two spaces on the rim, in which the follower scores six points. Followers on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> at <b>the</b> end of the game are not worth any points. Once scored, followers on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> are returned to their owners.|$|R

50|$|Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> {{offense is}} very helpful for team-building. Because <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> offense demands every player {{to have good}} ball-handling and {{shooting}} skills, each player is forced to develop more fully. In <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> offensive play, five players play as a team rather than individuals. Thus practicing and running <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> offense is very helpful for developing a team spirit among the players.|$|R
50|$|Centring is {{actually}} accomplished through shaping of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> tread of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is slightly tapered. When {{the train is}} in {{the centre of the}} track, the region of <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> in contact with the rail traces out a circle which has the same diameter for both <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> velocities of <b>the</b> two <b>wheels</b> are equal, so the train moves in a straight line.|$|R
5000|$|Clean <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> If a {{workpiece}} is softer than the grade for which <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is designed, <b>the</b> abrasive particles {{will not be}} dislodged in time to present fresh, sharp grains. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> therefore appears to lose its edge especially as the pores between grains fill with fragments of <b>the</b> workpiece. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> is then said to be loaded. This {{is one reason why}} <b>the</b> selection of <b>wheel</b> is extremely important.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason to}} add a lever to the {{mousetrap}} bar {{is to reduce the}} amount of torque applied to <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> If too much torque is applied to <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> force between <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>the</b> ground will exceed the maximum frictional force due to the coefficient of friction between <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and ground surfaces. When this happens, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> slip and energy stored in the spring is wasted. Using a long lever on the mousetrap bar reduces the tension in the string due to the spring's torque, and thus reduces the torque applied to <b>the</b> car's <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
