5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each {{was attached to}} a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had {{to be accompanied by}} a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E
5|$|History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1648) {{covers a}} period {{in the history of}} Poland and Lithuania, before their joint state was {{subjected}} to devastating wars {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a more closely unified federal state, replacing the previously existing personal union of the two countries. The Union was largely run by the Polish and increasingly Polonized Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, through <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central parliament and local assemblies, but from 1573 led by elected kings. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility constituted a sophisticated early democratic system, in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Waldorf State Apartments, {{consisting}} of nine suites, were {{located on the}} second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt {{and his wife had}} brought back from Europe. Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung-Chang of China, Chowfa Maha Rajiravuth, Prince of Siam, and Albert of Saxe-Coburg. The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits. There were about 6,000 lights in the hotel, with as many as 1,000 were small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures. The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Company. The building was wired throughout on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interior Conduit and Insulation Company.|$|E

While the law does not require any connection between <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administrative-territorial divisions of a federal subject and its municipal structure, Adygea's administrative districts are nevertheless incorporated as the municipal districts and the republican urban okrugs are incorporated as the municipal urban okrugs.

5|$|The {{system uses}} eight {{lettered}} zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county {{road in the}} system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system.

25|$|But the Liber secundus of 1685 {{can still}} be read today. Even after it was {{superseded}} by Book 3 of the Principia, it survived complete, {{in more than one}} manuscript. After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs). It appeared under the English title A Treatise of <b>the</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World. This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the Principia. Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title De Mundi Systemate, amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the Principia, making it look superficially {{as if it had been}} written by Newton after the Principia, rather than before. <b>The</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a 'corrected' reprint of the second edition (1740).|$|E

While in the death camps, the victims were usually killed shortly after arrival, in the other camps able-bodied Jews were worked and beaten to death. The operation of concentration camps depended on Kapos, the collaborator-prisoners. Some of them were Jewish themselves, and their prosecution after the war created an ethical dilemma.|$|E
