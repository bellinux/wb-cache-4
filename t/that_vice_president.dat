25|$|With emotion {{still in}} his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining {{the significance of the}} pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was no}} report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while.|$|E

In 1975, Lowe speculated <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Nelson A. Rockefeller, an older brother of Winthrop Rockefeller, had retained support within the Arkansas GOP because of “the feelings for his brother,” but Nelson Rockefeller soon removed himself for consideration to a full term and was replaced on the unsuccessful 1976 Republican ticket by Robert J.

25|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007, Whitman stated <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Dick Cheney's insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided that {{because she did not}} agree with the rule, she {{would not be able to}} defend it if it were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|Seychelles' {{previous}} president France Albert René came {{to power}} after his supporters overthrew the first president James Mancham on 5 June 1977 in a coup d'état and installed him as president. René {{was at that time}} the prime minister. René ruled as a strongman under a socialist one-party system until in 1993, when he was forced to introduce a multi-party system. He stepped down in 2004 in favour of his vice-president, James Michel, who was re-elected in 2006 and again in 2011.

25|$|Dean {{was criticized}} during his 2004 presidential {{campaign}} for another decision related to civil unions. Shortly before leaving office, {{he had some}} of his Vermont papers sealed {{for at least the}} next decade, a time frame longer than most outgoing governors use, stating that he was protecting the privacy of many gay supporters who sent him personal letters about the issue. On the campaign trail, he demanded <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including Democratic Senator and failed 2004 presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.|$|E

[...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with {{what seems to be the}} goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, as the Cosby {{controversy}} {{continued to}} unfold, {{there was an}} increasing movement {{to draw attention to}} sexual violence on college campuses, with growing criticism that the bureaucracy of higher education led to a culture where sexual crimes were not taken seriously. New York magazine referred to the movement in 2014 as a [...] "revolution against campus sexual assault". It became so prevalent <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Joe Biden released an op-ed in 2015 to combat the issue.

2500|$|According to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Libby {{first learned}} of Valerie Wilson's {{employment}} at the CIA in early June 2003 from Vice President Dick Cheney {{and proceeded to}} discuss her with six other government officials in the following days and months before disclosing her name to reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper in early July 2003. Fitzgerald asserts <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Cheney told Libby about Mrs. Wilson's CIA employment as the two crafted a response to an inquiry about Wilson's trip from reporter Walter Pincus. While her name was not disclosed to Pincus, Fitzgerald asserts that Pincus's inquiry [...] "further motivated [...] to counter Mr. Wilson’s assertions, making {{it more likely that}} [...] disclosures to the press concerning Mr. Wilson's wife were not casual disclosures that he had forgotten {{by the time he was}} asked about them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and before the grand jury." ...|$|E
2500|$|Voters {{were split}} {{as to who}} won the first presidential debate. Bush {{improved}} in the second debate. Before the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and {{spent much of the}} day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being intellectually cold. Reporter Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered; Dukakis's answer discussed the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Several commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue, but many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of a person asked about a loved one's rape and death. Tom Brokaw of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast, [...] "The consensus tonight is <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> George Bush won last night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night." ...|$|E
