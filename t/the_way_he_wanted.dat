5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable. Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> their characters to act when the cameras were off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera man was not around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu Kassovitz {{said that}} 20th Century Fox {{interfered}} throughout production, {{and he never}} had a chance to shoot a scene the way it was scripted, or <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be.|$|E

25|$|While Schmalz {{covered the}} 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, {{he started to}} figure out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to cover AIDS. In June 1992, he wrote his first post-diagnosis article about the disease, a profile piece on {{dermatologist}} Marcus Conant, {{one of the first}} U.S. doctors to diagnose and treat AIDS back in 1981. The New Yorker wrote an article about Schmalz and his work on October 5, 1992 and one month later he discussed his career and his illness during an appearance on Charlie Rose.|$|E
25|$|As a youngster, Cannavaro {{played for}} a team from Bagnoli before being quickly spotted by the scouts of Napoli, his {{hometown}} and favourite childhood team. Cannavaro initially served as the club's ball boy and would often watch his idols Diego Maradona and Ciro Ferrara play. He later joined the club's youth team, initially playing as a midfielder like his idol Marco Tardelli, before the team's youth coach switched him {{to the role of}} centre-back. He gained a reputation when, in a training session at Napoli, the young Fabio produced a strong sliding challenge on Maradona, who was then the undisputed star of the club, to dispossess him. The rough challenge angered teammates and staff at Napoli. However, Maradona himself defended the promising player and encouraged him to play <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> and reportedly congratulated by Cannavaro by giving him his boots as a souvenir after the training session.|$|E
25|$|Warren Oates as Willett Gashade. By {{the time}} Warren Oates starred in The Shooting, {{he had become}} a veteran western {{character}} actor, having appeared in dozens of film and television series in the genre since 1957. When director Hellman first suggested Oates as the star of the film, co-star and co-producer Nicholson immediately agreed with the choice. But during the filming, Nicholson and Oates repeatedly clashed, with the two frequently ending up in screaming matches. According to Hellman, production had to shut down for half a day when Oates refused to speak a lengthy amount of dialogue in the way Hellman wanted, preferring instead to whisper the lines almost unintelligibly. Oates stormed away from the film crew in anger when the director insisted. After Oates finally returned late in the afternoon, Hellman allowed the actor to read the lines <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> as long as he also read them in Hellman's preferred manner. In the editing room, Hellman rejected Oates's version.|$|E

50|$|Despite Carlson's culinary skill, Schwa has {{struggled}} to remain afloat. Friends have attributed this to a complete lack of business acumen on Carlson's part, {{as well as his}} general lack of interest in material possessions.

25|$|Mascis {{listened to}} classic rock {{artists such as}} the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, {{elements}} of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Daltrey spotted Entwistle {{by chance}} {{on the street}} {{carrying}} a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals. [...] The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, {{and a variety of}} pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, [...] "ran things <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> them". Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though he was older {{than the rest of the}} band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.|$|E

500|$|During the Corps' {{tenure at}} West Point, Nicola faced many challenges. Firstly, his troops {{did not act}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> In October 1777, Nicola sent out an arrest warrant for Sergeant Major Jonathan Guy for giving uniforms of the Continental Army to the British. The other example was in April 1778; Nicola stopped robberies done {{by members of the}} Corps in Easton. Secondly, Nicola was unable to fill the higher ranks {{because of the lack of}} {{qualifications}} from the men. In a letter to Washington, Nicola wrote that without men, he was unable to [...] "keep the men under proper discipline". During court trials, Nicola had to borrow men from other units as the jury. The third problem was the lack of enlisted men for the Corps.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} driven by Wong's desire to write an episode {{focussing}} on Watts, as he wanted to showcase O'Quinn as an actor. Wong also felt [...] "that by revealing that the Millennium Group had existed for centuries and setting the episode overseas, {{that would give the}} story greater scope and weight". The introduction of schisms within the Group was inspired by Wong's research into the Knights Templar and Freemasonry, as he considered these secretive organizations to have mirrored <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to present the Group, and he felt each contained factions or reactionary elements which he wanted to recreate. The episode features the penultimate appearance by C. C. H. Pounder as pathologist Cheryl Andrews. Pounder portrayed the character in four other episodes, appearing across all three seasons.|$|E

500|$|The {{piano wire}} scene {{was meant to}} end with Kirk's {{sandwich}} being sliced just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> until George Meyer suggested that his arm be cut off instead. Mike Scully described the ensuing laughter at his suggestion as the most intense he had ever heard from the staff, saying: [...] "They were literally choking because the joke was so unexpected. It was a shocked kind of laugh, and it just started rolling, one of those laughs that build the more they reverberate through you." [...] In the unemployment line, the unemployment recipient with the bucket hat and the beard is a caricature of George Meyer. Due to Phil Hartman's death, the recurring characters of Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were retired. As such, this episode is the last speaking appearance of Hutz, with him only being featured as a background character in some future episodes. McClure's final appearance would be in [...] "Bart the Mother", the third episode of season ten.|$|E
500|$|In the series' second season, new {{executive}} producers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{began to}} explore a new direction for the Group, moving away from its investigative function and giving a more religious focus. The tone of the second season focused more on the supernatural, showing the Group dealing with demonic forces more than the serial killers of the first season. Producer Ken Horton felt that the increased focus on the Group in the second season arose as the first season's use of serial killers as episodic antagonists had [...] "overpowered" [...] its storytelling, making it necessary to turn the show's attention elsewhere instead; the focus switched from external forces and villains to the internal workings of the Group. The introduction of schisms within the Group was inspired by Wong's research into the Knights Templar and Freemasonry, as he considered these secretive organizations to have mirrored <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to present the Group, and he felt each contained factions or reactionary elements which he wanted to recreate.|$|E
500|$|... "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} between March 1994 and May 1995, with the composition happening in sessions between band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker's basement recording studio, and the recording itself being done {{at their own}} Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Bass on [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] was played by Mike Kashou, and additional percussion by Pauli Ryan. In the latter stages of the album recording, Garbage mixed [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] twice before it was sent for mastering. At the last minute, Vig decided to increase the mix of the guitar tracks louder; he later claimed that the song still did not sound <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it to, in his head. The mixing was noted for Manson's voice being at the same volume level as the instruments, while in mainstream pop the singing is louder than the musical backdrop. The song is written in the key of G# minor, set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, and the chord progression is G#m–F#–E–C#m–E–F# in the verses and C#-F#-A-B in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|An initial fee of £300,000 was agreed, plus an {{additional}} £50,000 depending on appearances, and in October 1998 Horsfield joined Fulham. A clause was {{also included in}} the contract which would allow Halifax a share of the profits from any future sale. The remainder of his 1998–99 season produced 15 goals from 28 games as Fulham won the Second Division title by 14 clear points. He was also named in the PFA's Second Division Team of the Year. According to Keegan, [...] "Geoff's your old-fashioned centre forward and we love him. He will score goals in this division, he will score goals in the next divisions. He chases a lot of lost causes and is very important for us." [...] Though less prolific in the First Division, seven league goals and another seven in the cups still made him the club's top scorer for the 1999–2000 season. After new manager Jean Tigana made it clear that Horsfield's aggressive style and perceived lack of pace and mobility would not fit <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> his new team to play, and brought in Louis Saha as his main striker, the player agreed to join Fulham's First Division rivals Birmingham City.|$|E
