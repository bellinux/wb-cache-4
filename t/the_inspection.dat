50|$|An Ofsted {{inspection}} in May 2014 {{rated the}} school as 'inadequate' and a monitoring inspection in January 2015 found that the school was still not meeting independent school standards. <b>The</b> <b>inspections</b> found that teaching was inadequate, and was undermining British values because of restricted educational opportunities for girls.

These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>inspection</b> of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of {{some parts of the}} aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>inspection,</b> Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries in England.

On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to <b>the</b> <b>inspection</b> requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to wrap up {{the point of view}} of <b>the</b> bank <b>inspection</b> and to figure out how the basic idea of GHQ/SCAP is reflected in <b>the</b> Japanese bank <b>inspection</b> manual.

This research paper consists of the following: 1) To see what contents were copied from the US to <b>the</b> Japanese bank <b>inspection</b> policy in post World War II. 2) To analyze how <b>the</b> bank <b>inspection</b> procedure was taken over from GHQ/SCAP by checking the contents of the Japanese “New bank inspection method”. 3) To compare the contents of <b>the</b> new bank <b>inspection</b> method to <b>the</b> bank <b>inspection</b> manual in prewar Japan. One characteristic of <b>the</b> new bank <b>inspection</b> method was to set the objectives of <b>the</b> bank <b>inspection</b> to keep <b>the</b> security of the bank management and to realize the public nature of banking. Another characteristic of <b>the</b> new bank <b>inspection</b> method was that the manual implemented new concepts: 1) scientific approach, 2) enforcement of empirical testing, 3) systematization to power up <b>the</b> bank <b>inspection</b> in order to help the collaboration of bank regulatory policy and bank inspection policy...|$|R
