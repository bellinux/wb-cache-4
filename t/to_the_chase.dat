5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover dates back <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Chase,</b> where a Dalek was implied {{to have taken}} flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the United States Army Air Forces, {{which became}} the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1947, {{developed}} a requirement for a new, large assault glider type to replace smaller types that were then in service, all existing gliders having been declared obsolete. The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required to be easily adaptable to a powered configuration. As part of a five-year development program, a contract was awarded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase</b> Aircraft Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 {{for the construction of}} two types of gliders. These included a smaller model being designated XCG-18A, and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.|$|E
5|$|Somerset had {{performed}} well but missed out narrowly {{in both the}} other one-day competitions in 2009, and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match. News filtered through to the County Ground during their final match, against Durham, that leaders Sussex had lost to Worcestershire, meaning that a win against the north-eastern team would guarantee Somerset the title. The result rarely looked likely; a rapid opening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> by Durham openers Phil Mustard and Ian Blackwell provided a platform for their team to claim victory, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), {{more than any other}} county in Division One.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico. These locations ran the gamut from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E
25|$|The next {{format of}} the Chase was {{announced}} by France on January 26, 2011, along with several other changes, most significantly to the points system. After 26 races, 12 drivers still advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase,</b> but the qualifying criteria changed, {{as well as the}} number of base points that drivers received at the points reset.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, NASCAR {{announced}} another revamp <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase</b> format, {{expanding the}} Chase pool to 16 drivers, and eliminating four drivers after every three races, leaving four drivers {{to compete for}} the championship at the season finale at Homestead. In addition, wins were given an increased emphasis, with the 16 drivers with the most wins (15 if the points leader is winless; points leader will receive an automatic berth) gaining a spot in the chase. If there are less than 16 winners, the remaining spots will be filled based on the conventional points system.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{started off}} solidly in their reply, {{but then the}} Bangladesh spinners led by Shakib and Mohammad Ashraful took wickets at regular intervals. The match was evenly poised with Ireland 93/4 after 25 overs. Niall O'Brien was the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> but with the score at 110, he was {{dismissed}} after a brilliant catch by Tamim Iqbal. Kevin O'Brien continued to fight, taking Ireland above 150 and giving them another sniff at victory till he holed out to deep square-leg off Shafiul Islam. A pumped-up Shafiul then ran through the tail, and Ireland were all out for 178, falling 27 runs short.|$|E
25|$|Rockwell {{transferred}} {{from high school}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase</b> Art School {{at the age of}} 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys' Life, and other youth publications. As a student, Rockwell was given small jobs of minor importance. His first major breakthrough came at age 18 with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy's Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} occurred around 7:20am, {{when the}} balloon {{was attempting to}} land after completing a partial figure-8 flight pattern over the Carterton area. The pilot had indicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> team he was likely to land near Somerset Road, a rural through road just north of Carterton in the locality of Clareville. At first the balloon was heading north-east over Somerset Road, around 700metres east of the road's intersection with State Highway 2. Around 400metres north of Somerset Road, the balloon reversed direction and headed back towards the road. The two chase vehicles, carrying some {{of the family members}} of the passengers, positioned on the road ready to assist with the landing.|$|E

25|$|Menard {{returned}} to the 27 for 2014, with the car running schemes more oriented towards the associate sponsors of MENARDS featured {{on the hood of}} the car. Six races prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase</b> for the Sprint Cup at Indy in July, Menard was involved in an incident with part-time driver Juan Pablo Montoya, sending Menard into the turn 3 wall and relegating him to a 34th-place finish. The incident upset both driver and crew, who felt Montoya had cost them a spot in the Chase (Menard was dropped to 16th in points). After the fall Richmond race, Menard remained winless and ranked 20th in points, losing out on a spot in the new chase format.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen of the 16 {{slots in}} the Chase Grid are {{reserved}} for the drivers with the most race wins over the first 26 races, provided that said drivers are in the top 30 in series points and have attempted to qualify for each race (with rare exceptions). The remaining spot is reserved for the points leader after 26 races, if that driver {{does not have a}} victory. If fewer than 16 drivers have wins in the first 26 races, the remaining Chase Grid spots are filled by winless drivers in order of season points. As in the recent past, all drivers on the Chase Grid have their driver points reset to 2,000 prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chase,</b> with a 3-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races.|$|E
25|$|The next day, on 26 March, , {{under the}} command of Captain Charles B.H. Ross, was sailing from Santo Domingo to Curacoa when she {{encountered}} two French navy brigs. At 1pm, Pique began firing at long range, and by 2pm had caught up with them. After an intensive cannonade that lasted some 20 minutes, Pique was able to send a boarding aboard one of the two French vessels. A terrible struggle ensued before the French vessel struck. The French crew had concealed themselves under sails and in the wreckage, emerging once the boarding party arrived and subjecting it to a devastating fusillade that killed or wounded most of the boarding party. Ross then sent over more men, before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> of the second brig. After the exchange of several more broadsides, the second French vessel struck.|$|E

25|$|The pursuers skillfully took up {{position}} to limit South Carolinas options {{in trying to}} get away, the British windward ship attempted to mask the South Carolinas wind. For eighteen hours the British chased South Carolina. When she came in range, she fired her stern chasers at Diomede, which returned fire from her bow-guns. By 1500hrs the British ships were close enough to exchange shots and could each yaw, fire a broadside and return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase</b> while preventing South Carolina from doing the same. The first of the British broadsides did major damage to South Carolina, leading Joyner to call his officers together to discuss whether to fight or to continue the flight. The decision was to continue the latter. By 1700hrs Quebec and Diomede came up alongside South Carolina, with Astrea behind in support, together with Hope and Constance. The British were soon in position to fire six broadsides, five from the Diomede and the other from the Quebec, all aimed at South Carolinas masts, sails and rigging, which within two hours were in tatters.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Hooters {{sponsored}} NASCAR driver Alan Kulwicki as {{he won the}} Winston Cup Championship, beating Bill Elliott by ten points, {{the closest}} margin in NASCAR prior <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Chase</b> era. On April 1, 1993 Kulwicki, along with several others including Hooters Chairman Bob Brooks' son Mark {{were killed in a}} plane crash near Bristol, Tennessee. They were flying back to the track for Sunday's race after making a sponsor appearance at a Hooters in Knoxville, Tennessee. Hooters remained in the sport, sponsoring drivers like Loy Allen Jr., Rick Mast and Brett Bodine before ending their involvement in 2003. The restaurant returned to NASCAR in 2007 to sponsor a Craftsman Truck Series team led by Jason White, Derrike Cope and Brad Keselowski. Six years later, Hooters sponsored Nationwide Series driver Nelson Piquet Jr.'s car. For the 2016 Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, Hooters made a comeback in the Cup Series with a one-off paint scheme for Greg Biffle. Hooters currently sponsors the No. 24 of Chase Elliott.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan started {{well in the}} ICC Cricket World Cup, {{which was}} held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, after beating Kenya, Sri Lanka (one of the tournament favourites) and bye a margin, beating Canada. Shahid Afridi clearly stated that his team is capable of {{qualifying}} for the Semifinals. After a huge loss against New Zealand, Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 7 wickets. After victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC CWC 2011 Quarters. One {{of the highlights of}} the tournament for Pakistan was when they beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display. This saw Australia's record win streak of 27 consecutive world cup games broken which saw them win every game between the 1999 world cup up until this game. In the quarter-finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were ruthless, as they emphatically won against the West Indies side by 10 wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the semi-finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India managed 260 after they batted first. Not having a good batting line-up along with a slow start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase,</b> Pakistan were 29 runs short as India reached the final (India {{went on to win the}} final, by defeating Sri Lanka).|$|E
