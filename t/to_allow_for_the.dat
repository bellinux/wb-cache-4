5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> widened gape.|$|E

Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E

5|$|St. Lawrence's Church is an Anglican parish {{church at}} Mereworth, Kent, United Kingdom. It {{is in the}} deanery of West Malling, the Diocese of Rochester and Province of Canterbury. The church {{was built in the}} mid-1740s by John Fane, the 7th Earl of Westmorland {{following}} his removal of the village's 12th century place of worship <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enlargement of Mereworth Castle.|$|E
5|$|The Grantham Canal is a canal {{that runs}} for 33 miles (53km) from Grantham, falling through 18 locks to West Bridgford where it joins the River Trent. It was built {{primarily}} <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797, and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then {{sold to a}} railway company, after which it declined, and was finally closed in 1936.|$|E

25|$|The {{water network}} around Satu Mare is {{composed}} of the Someș River, Pârâul Sar {{in the north and}} the Homorod River in the south. The formation and evolution of the city was closely related to the Someș River, which, in addition <b>to</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> settlement of a human community around it, has offered, since the early Middle Ages, the possibility of international trade with coastal regions, a practice that favored milling, fishing and other economic activities.|$|R

5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> casting of an older actress.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|By April 2010 {{almost five}} {{years had passed since}} the {{previous}} general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E

5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one of only a handful of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started on}} the {{extension}} in 1914. <b>To</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extension of the line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments {{within the limits of}} Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E

5|$|Further {{development}} of BackupHDDVD was being hosted on SourceForge until the site received a DMCA takedown notice alleging a violation in late February.

HDDecrypter, a port of BackupHDDVD to C with a native Windows GUI is also available. This version supports multiple CPU threads and runs faster than its Java counterparts.

5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France.

At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peaceful transfer of non-military goods to {{an enemy of the}} nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, San Diego {{officials}} {{believed that a}} normal school should be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers. The tuition and travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E
