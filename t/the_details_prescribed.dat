40|$|Drug Education may be {{evaluated}} in two ways: by examination {{of what a}} doctor knows, or by audit of what a doctor does. Since knowledge does not necessarily determine performance, the audit approach is more appropriate. It has three requirements: [...] <b>detailed</b> <b>prescribing</b> data must be available {{for the purpose of}} comparison; [...] drug volumes must be measured accurately, and prescribing rates be standardized for the age-sex structure and morbidity of the practice population; [...] valid standards must be established. In <b>the</b> United Kingdom <b>detailed</b> <b>prescribing</b> data are available. However, methods of measurements are unsatisfactory and standards are based either on local averages of dubious worth, or on an approach that is negative and often arbitrary.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, due to early {{detection}} and advances in treatments, rectal cancer survival has been improved significantly. Meanwhile, rectal cancer survivors and health practitioners are facing more challenges arising from the disease, in terms of survivors’ longterm morbidity and work ability. The general aims of the register-based doctoral projects therefore include: 1). to evaluate the short- and long-term work loss in incident relapse-free rectal cancer survivors, together with the underlying association between work loss and survivors’ clinical characteristics; 2). to investigate the long-term cardiotoxicity in irradiated relapse-free rectal cancer survivors; 3). to systematically estimate the long-term drug use {{as a proxy for}} morbidity in relapse-free rectal cancer survivors. In Study I, we included 2815 curatively treated working-age rectal cancer patients without previous disability pension and their matched general comparators. After a median follow-up of 6 years (range 0 - 10 years), we found nearly one fourth relapse-free survivors and one tenth of their comparators were on disability pension listing, making the disability pension risk significantly doubled in the relapse-free survivors. Abdominoperineal resection was associated with higher disability pension risk than anterior resection. Surgical complications and reoperation also yielded more risk in survivors’ disability pension. In Study II, using the same study design as the previous study, we found the median work loss days during the 1 st after treatment was 147 days and 336 days among relapse-free rectal cancer survivors without (n= 2, 529) and with (n= 909) prediagnostic work loss history, respectively. Among those who had prediagnostic work loss, the post-treatment work loss varied very little by clinical characteristics; whereas among those without any prediagnostic work loss, advanced stage at diagnosis, operated with Abdominoperineal resection, neoadjuvant (chemo) radiotherapy treatment and surgical complications were all associated with higher work loss risk in survivors. In Study III, we included 14901 register-based (9227 received preoperative radiotherapy (RT) and surgery and 5674 were treated only with surgery) and 2675 trial-based (randomized into preoperative RT or not followed by surgery) relapse-free rectal cancer patients during a maximum follow-up of 18 and 33 years, respectively. We found no significant overall or subtypes of cardiovascular risk associated with preoperative RT. Although a slightly elevated risk of venous thromboembolism was noted in both cohorts during the first 6 months following treatment, the absolute number of patients affected was rather low, hence the safety of RT was further assured. In Study IV, we evaluated <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>prescribed</b> drug dispensing using defined daily doses (DDDs) by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification among relapse-free rectal cancer patients across a maximum follow-up of 10 years. In comparison to the general population, rectal cancer survivors had a slight increase in overall drug use. While the survivors did acquire more drugs in digestive system, this could be due to both the long-term disease complications and potential prophylactic treatment...|$|R

Variances and covariances of these beliefs also exhibited gender-based differences. Men and women hold conceptually similar but distinct perceptions of inducements, which {{may influence the}} development and evaluation of psychological contracts.

At the level of the individual, psychological contracts represent the perceived set of mutual obligations exchanged between employees and their employers (Rousseau, 1989). Psychological contracts are perceptual in nature and can contain both transactional and relational components (Coyle-Shapiro & Kessler, 2000; McLean Parks, Kidder, & Gallagher, 1998). The relational component reflects an affect-laden, open-ended exchange whereas the transactional component reflects a more calculative exchange for specific times and tasks (Rousseau, 1995; Rousseau & McLean Parks, 1992).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the use of off-label antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and paediatric wards in Jordan. Methods: Data of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care units and paediatric wards in King Abdulla University Hospital were collected over an 8 -week survey between May and July 2012. Data collected in this study included patients’ age, weight, medical history, diagnosis and <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of antibiotics <b>prescribed</b> to each patient. Results: The study involved a total of 250 children (80 admitted to the NICU and 170 admitted to the wards). A total of 598 antibiotic prescriptions were issued for these patients (244 in NICUs and 354 in paediatricwards). The results {{of the present study}} show that off-label antibiotic prescribing to paediatric patients is very common. Off-label antibiotic prescribing to paediatric patients is related mostly to doses and indications, and rarely to age. The majority of admitted patients received at least one off-label antibiotic during their hospital stay. Conclusion: This study reveals the high prevalence of off-label use of antibiotic among paediatric children in Jordan. There is a serious need for robust and continuous educational programs to improve the awareness of paediatricians of guidelines surrounding the use of antibiotics in paediatric patients. Furthermore, true collaboration between paediatricians and clinical pharmacists towards safe and effective antibiotic prescribing in paediatric patients is crucial...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of nowadays embedded systems. Along with system complexity, the complexity of safety engineering grew alike. Many engineers in industry face the challenge that they do not oversee what is necessary to develop a safe system anymore. The putative way out of this misery is to buy the relevant (international) standard for functional safety and obstinately follow the requirements written in there. But this appearance is deceiving. Standards for functional safety (and standards in general) have the disadvantages that as more <b>detailed</b> <b>the</b> standards <b>prescribe</b> things, the less people think about what it means to build a safe system. Contributing to this nuisance is the plethora of available seminars, and companies making money out of the needs of the engineers. In the end most of the seminars do not really help the engineer in understanding the standards or more importantly functional safety, but even worse they further push the idea of unattainability of the Holy Grail "safety". We literally reach out a helping hand to these engineers (and researchers). "Literally" is meant in the sense that we reduced this overvalued, almost artistic discipline, safety engineering, to five main principles: One for each finger! Thus, all you need is a "handful" of safety...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} focused on the private sector {{organizations}} (businesses) that support the economy at the individual, family, community, local, state and national levels. However, even with this focus, the framework and principles of for profit business crisis and continuity management (BCCM) are applicable to all organizations, be they private, public or not-for-profit. Organizations exist to provide products and/or services to their customers and should strive to maintain and/restore this capability, {{even in the face of}} highly disruptive events. Regardless of the terminology chosen as the title for organizational continuity, crisis and continuity management or continuity of operations, continuity is a strategic responsibility and function for all organizations if they are to survive and prosper. Central to the development and maintenance of a comprehensive organizational continuity program is an understanding of the myriad functions supporting continuity and their interdependencies. Recent efforts to develop a national standard as contained in the NFPA 1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs, 2004 Edition, is a starting point, but falls short of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> necessary to <b>prescribe</b> true standards. As an alternate to the NFPA 1600 program description, a visual framework of BCCM, with definitions is presented and explained as the foundation of an enterprise wide program of BCCM. The framework was developed to be simple enough to be understandable at all levels of an organization, yet complete enough to support the case for functional integration and management to multiple stakeholders including boards of directors, executive level managers, stock owners, and customers. The framework supporting function of risk management and its sub-functions is explained to demonstrate the applicability and benefit of the business specific functions of business area analysis and business impact analysis to any organization...|$|R
40|$|Labor {{laws are}} in the process of being {{reformed}} in many parts of the world. Traditional labor laws were originally shaped and developed in societies undergoing industrialization oriented toward large-scale production and large-scale consumption, and in consequence they have become unable to cope with the increasing complexity and globalization of society in recent years. The new labor law theories that are attracting attention as the basis of this change and reform are the procedural regulations theory being advocated in Europe and the structural approach in the U. S. The theoretical bases of these two differ, the former being based on politico-philosophical thinking and the latter on economic thinking. Nevertheless, what the two have in common is the advocacy of new theories and approaches to address the realities of societies that are growing increasingly diverse and complex, and the consequent giving of importance to dynamic processes. By considering the current state of Japan's system of labor law in the light of these two legal theories, we can see the issues affecting labor law reform and its direction. One important issue is that of building a foundation for decentralized communication in which the opinions of diverse employees can be reflected, and another is that of shifting the regulatory substance of labor laws away from an ex-ante regulatory system in which <b>the</b> state <b>prescribes</b> <b>detailed</b> rules, and toward an ex-post regulatory system that gives importance to collective communication by the parties concerned. ...|$|R
40|$|The model-based {{approach}} in control engineering works well when a reliable plant model is available. However, in practice, reliable models seldom exist: instead, typical “levels” of limited reliability occur. For instance, Computed Torque Control (CTC) in robotics assumes almost perfect models. The Adaptive Inverse Dynamics Controller (AIDC) and the Slotine Li Adaptive Robot Controller (SLARC) assume absolutely correct analytical model form, and only allows imprecise knowledge regarding the actual {{values of the}} model parameters. Neglecting the effects of dynamically coupled subsystems, and allowing the action of unknown external disturbances means {{a higher level of}} corrupted model reliability. Friction-related problems are typical examples of this case. In the traditional control literature, such problems are tackled by either drastic “robust” or rather intricate “adaptive” solutions, both designed by the use of Lyapunov’s 2 nd method that is a complicated technique requiring advanced mathematical skills from the designer. As an alternative design methodology, the use of Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT) was suggested, which concentrates on guaranteeing <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> <b>details</b> of tracking error relaxation via generation of iterative control signal sequences that converge on the basis of Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem. This approach is essentially based on the fresh data collected by observing the behavior of the controlled systems, rather than {{in the case of the}} traditional ones. For the first time, this technique is applied for order reduction in the adaptive control of a strongly nonlinear plant with significant model imprecisions: the control of a DC motor driven arm in dynamic interaction with a nonlinear environment is demonstrated via numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{approval}} of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) offers a major {{advance in the}} management of HCV infection. These DAAs, boceprevir and telaprevir, when given with pegylated interferon alfa (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), result in a much higher sustained virologic response rate compared with Peg-IFN and RBV. The DAA-containing regimens are approved for HCV genotype 1 infection in HCV treatment–naive and HCV treatment–experienced patients. In this review, we present an overview of pharmacology, efficacy, adverse events, and emergence of resistance-associated variants with the use of these agents.

40|$|Taylorism, we are told, is {{essentially}} alienating. This paper argues the opposite thesis. I submit that Taylorism represents a fundamentally emancipatory philosophy of job design. Since Taylorism continues to exert enormous {{influence in the}} practice of job design — as witnessed by current enthusiasm for Total Quality Management, ISO 9000, and a host of management techniques for bringing greater discipline to manufacturing, clerical and professional work — this debate matters. By Taylorism, I refer to a pattern in job design practice and theory that privileges short repetitive work cycles, <b>detailed</b> <b>prescribed</b> task sequences, and a separation of conception from execution. What I will call the “standard critique ” sees such job designs as essentially alienating and thus engendering low levels of motivation and commitment.
