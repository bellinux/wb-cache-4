5|$|Janet's {{landfall}} as a Category5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was {{the first}} recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland; prior <b>to</b> <b>Janet,</b> landfalls of Category5 intensity were only known {{to have taken place}} on islands. Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. At least 1,023deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8million in damages. The name Janet was later retired from the Atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific research community.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} Swan Islands, Janet made {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700UTC on September28. At the time, it had winds of 175mph (280km/h). Hurricane force winds were reported {{for two hours}} preceding the hurricane's landfall, with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar (hPa; 28.00inHg). Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due <b>to</b> <b>Janet.</b> In Xcalak, Quintana Roo, the strong winds from Janet flattened the port's infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage. 97people were killed in Xcalak, constituting {{more than a third}} of the port's population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet (2m), 1600ft (490m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40million in damages and at least 500deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, as Janet {{dissipated}} {{over the}} mountainous central Mexico, the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the Tamisi and Panuco River basins. The water {{levels in the}} Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks. In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets. According to some sources, 800people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city. Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River. The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12people. Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800people in the town to evacuate. Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated to amount to $12million in damages. Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200million, {{nearly half of the}} government's 1955national budget. Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates, at least 1,000people were injured and another 100,000people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due <b>to</b> <b>Janet.</b>|$|E

50|$|Though {{initially}} {{upset at}} having to wear the body brace, Deenie eventually resigns herself to her fate. She finds herself at peace {{with the idea of}} not becoming a model, and, inspired by her experience, begins to ponder a future career as an orthopedist, concluding that she never really wanted to be a model anyway. The book concludes with Deenie asking her father, Frank, for permission to not wear the brace <b>to</b> <b>Janet's</b> party. Though Thelma is amenable to the idea, Frank, who, until then, was rather mute about everything, firmly refuses, rightfully pointing out that Deenie would want to not wear the brace for every special occasion thereafter if he gave in that night. In defiance, Deenie brings a bag with the outfit that would not fit over the brace <b>to</b> <b>Janet's</b> house, intending <b>to</b> remove the brace and change clothes once there, but she changes her mind and leaves the bag in Janet's room {{for the duration of the}} party.|$|R
