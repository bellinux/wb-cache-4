When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she {{realized that there was}} not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first “Librarian for the Deaf Community” from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one {{of the first}} library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.|$|E

500|$|O'Sullivan is a keen {{football}} fan and {{a supporter}} of Arsenal. Another of his hobbies is motor racing. In 2004, he appeared on Top Gear as the [...] "Star in a [...] ", and finished {{with a time of}} 1:47.3 around the test track in a Suzuki Liana. He also succeeded in clearing a snooker table of four reds plus all the colours faster than the Stig was able to drive O'Sullivan's own Mercedes SL 500, with its [...] "147" [...] number plate, around the track. Over the weekend of 15–16 August 2009, in the Volkswagen Racing Cup at Silverstone using a Volkswagen Jetta with the car number [...] "147", he drove two 20-minute rounds. In the first round, he spun off into a gravel trap, but fared better in the second, in which he finished 14th. O'Sullivan is also a keen runner, and runs for Woodford Green with Essex Ladies.

500|$|Meanwhile, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) {{wants to}} help a grocery-store worker, Guillermo (Lin-Manuel Miranda), so she convinces Jay (Ed O'Neill) to let Guillermo pitch him a {{business}} idea: a dog-training system labeled [...] "The Good-doggy / Bad-doggy Training System", which consists of two sets of dog treats, one of them being bland {{and the other a}} tastier one with bacon. The pitch goes wrong when Guillermo's dog, Stella (Brigitte), chews on Jay's pillow and seems to prefer the bad doggy treat. Seeing that Gloria's blind encouragement is doing him no favours, Jay adopts a firm, frank tone with Guillermo and tells him that, while he has obvious skill, enthusiasm and charisma, his idea is not good. Guillermo, who had invested five years of his life in this idea, leaves in tears. Gloria follows him to apologize, but Guillermo admits that he found Jay's honesty refreshing, and has decided to reorganize his life, which means moving back in with his sister <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> but it also means that he must give the dog away. Gloria allows the dog to stay with them much to Jay's anger, which is increased when Manny walks in and believes the dog is a present for him. Jay drives the dog to the pound but Stella's sweet face makes him take her back home.|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old {{enough to be able to}} ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
