5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E

5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days, Thodoros is {{becoming}} more and more paranoid, as <b>he</b> first suspects <b>that</b> someone is playing a prank on him, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> being blackmailed and, as the fake Lefterakis seems to know a lot of details about him, <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> indeed losing his mind.|$|R

25|$|His {{health was}} poor but {{his desire for}} {{retirement}} was refused. Camillus decided <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would command through his son Lucius. Thus, Camillus campaigned. On the battlefield, although Camillus tried {{to help with the}} military actions while located safely in a distant camp, Lucius could not cope with his duties so Camillus moved onto the battlefield and the Romans were able to defeat their enemy. Camillus headed then to Satricum with his youngest men and the city was relieved.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August 2009, anti-Ukrainian demonstrations {{were held}} in Crimea by ethnic Russian residents. Sergei Tsekov (of the Russian Bloc and then deputy speaker of the Crimean parliament) said <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped that Russia would treat Crimea {{the same way as}} it had treated South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Crimea is {{populated}} by an ethnic Russian majority and a minority of both ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, and thus demographically possessed one of Ukraine's largest ethnic Russian populations.|$|E
25|$|Unhappy {{with either}} offer, Stewart then {{asked for the}} return of the Stax masters, but the {{executives}} at Warner-Seven Arts refused. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was informed that Atlantic's lawyers had included a clause in the 1965 distribution contract which gave Atlantic all right, title and interest, including any rights of reproduction, in all Stax's Atlantic-distributed recordings between 1960 and 1967. Only its unreleased recordings remained the property of Stax; all of the masters delivered to Atlantic between 1960 and 1967 are still wholly owned by Atlantic's current parent company, Warner Music Group.|$|E

Pellot showed an {{interest}} in baseball at a young age, however his father didn't want him to play baseball and would punish him if he caught him doing so. When he was 13 years old, his father died and it was only <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to play the game he loved. His mother moved to the city of Caguas, there he attended and graduated from José Gautier Benítez High School.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} he lived in Bath, and played once for Somerset in 1905, {{but it was clear}} from his failure <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could no longer play serious cricket. His weight gain, {{combined}} with a congenital heart abnormality, resulted in a fatal heart attack at the age of 41, whilst on a summer walking holiday in Chambéry, France. According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker. Richardson was buried in Richmond Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{joined the}} All-England Eleven, playing {{his first game}} for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got up to some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hecker {{returned}} to his farm in Illinois. It was with great joy that he heard of the union of Germany {{brought about by the}} victory over France in 1870-71. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gave his famous address at St. Louis, in which he gave animated expression to the enthusiasm of the German Americans for their newly united fatherland. After the war, he became more and more involved in the German-language press and Republican Party activities. He received a less favourable impression when he visited Germany in 1873 for criticizing lack of individual rights and the size of government in the new German government organization. He died at his farm in Summerfield, Illinois on March 24, 1881.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Tenochtitlan {{with a large}} army, on November 8 {{they were}} peacefully {{received}} by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter {{the heart of the}} Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later. The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians. But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.|$|E

The latter was translated into French the same year, and is considered by many historians to be his most original contribution to military literature.|$|E
25|$|Kon Ichikawa {{stated in}} a Criterion Collection {{interview}} that he had witnessed {{the destruction of the}} atom bomb first hand, and had felt since <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to speak out against the horrors of war, despite the many comedies that made up most of his early career. Fires on the Plain got greenlighted by the studio Daiei, because they thought it would be an action movie. Ichikawa decided that it was a film that needed to be made in black and white, specifically requesting Eastman's black and white. The studio initially balked, but after a month of arguing, the studio agreed to Ichikawa's request. Ichikawa also said that he had wanted actor Eiji Funakoshi to be in the film from the beginning. Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, penned the script which got the approval of novel author Shohei Ooka.|$|E
