40|$|Background: This study tests <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> interim {{accounting}} information. The {{study also}} explores whether <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> annual and interim financial statements {{has changed over}} time. Aim: It explores whether <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> interim financial statements is higher than <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> annual financial statements. Finally, it investigates whether accounting information published in interim and annual financial statements has incremental value <b>relevance.</b> Setting: Data for <b>the</b> period from 1999 to 2012 were collected from a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Method: The Ohlson model to investigate <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> accounting information {{was used for the}} study. Results: The results show that interim book value of equity is value relevant while interim earnings are not. Interim financial statements appear to have higher value relevance than annual financial statements. <b>The</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> interim and annual accounting information has remained fairly constant over the sample period. Incremental comparisons provide evidence that additional book value of equity and earnings that accrue to a company between interim and annual reporting dates are value relevant. Conclusion: The study was conducted over a long sample period (1999 – 2012), in an era when a technology-driven economy and more timely reporting media could have had an effect on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> published accounting information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> published interim and annual financial statements...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and {{the effect}} of the {{financial}} crisis on European financial firms. The empirical work is divided into two parts. The first part examines the impact of mandatory IFRS adoption and of the financial crisis on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> accounting information. For a sample of financial firms listed in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland over 1998 - 2012, the results indicate that <b>the</b> combined value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> book value of equity and earnings has increased following mandatory IFRS adoption in 2005, thereby supporting the view that IFRS adoption improves the quality of accounting information. In addition, the findings suggest that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> book value of equity increases while that of earnings decreases as the financial crisis evolves. Moreover, during the crisis period <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> equity book value appears greater for firms operating in countries with weak institutional environment as well as for firms with weak corporate governance mechanisms. The results are consistent for the whole sample of financial firms and a sub-sample of banks. The second empirical part of this thesis evaluates <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 that requires firms to classify fair value measurements into three levels based on the valuation inputs. Using a sample of listed financial firms in the EEA and Switzerland over 2009 - 2012, the results show that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> level 1 and level 2 fair values is greater than <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> fair values at level 3, although the difference is significant only for level 1. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> level 3 fair values is lower for firms domiciled in countries characterised by a weak institutional environment and for firms with weak corporate governance mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– The paper aims {{to examine}} the {{influence}} of financial disclosure (FD) level and time on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings, book value, and cash flows relative to three share price proxies, namely average annual share price, annual closing share price, and share price after a three-month period following the financial year-end for Jordanian companies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs price model to examine the influence of FD level and time on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> three accounting variables relative to three share price proxies for 91 Jordanian companies (consisting of 5, 460 observations) within 2004 - 2009. Findings– Relative to three share price proxies, the findings proved that FD level and time have a significant influence on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> book value, but not for cash flows. Also, FD level and time have a significant influence on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings relative to annual closing share price, while they are not relative to share price after a three-month period following the financial year-end. FD time has a significant influence on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings relative to the average annual share price.
