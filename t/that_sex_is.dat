5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
25|$|According to Ward and Ogden's {{qualitative}} {{study on the}} experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).|$|E

500|$|Journalist Luke Ford writes <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> given {{emphasis}} over {{story in}} A Free Ride. The film uses humor in its opening credits through false {{cast and crew}} names, such as A. Wise Guy as director, Will B. Hard as photographer, and Will She as the title writer. Williams describes this as [...] "crude humor" [...] and asserts it was common in American stag films produced from this time. Professor Frank A. Hoffman of University at Buffalo writes that the film's production standard indicates {{that there had been}} previous experimentation with stag films. O'Toole writes that despite the elementary nature of movies like A Free Ride, stag films became [...] "rigidified into a restricted visual experience" [...] {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E
500|$|Raëlians believe <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> a normal, {{natural and}} healthy {{part of life}} and {{encourage}} people {{to be true to}} their natural sexuality. They promote healing from damaging messages from strict puritanical belief systems and social stigmas that stifle one's natural sexuality. Acceptance of masturbation, homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, naturism and any legal, safe and consensual adult activity is promoted as part of a healthy and long life, and this is used to attract young converts to the religion. Raelians believe that sexuality is a gift of pleasure to mankind from the Elohim. The Raëlian book Let's Welcome our Fathers From Space says that new advanced extraterrestrial civilizations will ultimately practice a final religion or [...] "religion of the infinite" [...] that involves ubiquitous practice of Sensual Meditation.|$|E

500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend <b>that</b> <b>SEX</b> <b>IS</b> SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky.

500|$|The third book covers asceticism. He {{discusses}} marriage, {{which is}} treated similarly in the Paedagogus. Clement rejects the Gnostic opposition to marriage, arguing that only {{men who are}} uninterested in women should remain celibate, and <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> a positive good if performed within marriage {{for the purposes of}} procreation. However it has not always been so: the Fall occurred because Adam and Eve succumbed to their desire for each other, and copulated before the allotted time. He argues against the idea that Christians should reject their family for an ascetic life, which stems from Luke , contending that Jesus would not have contradicted the precept to [...] "Honour thy Father and thy Mother" [...] (Exodus [...] ), one of the Ten Commandments. Clement concludes that asceticism will only be rewarded if the motivation is Christian in nature, and thus the asceticism of non-Christians such as the gymnosophists is pointless.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> {{the most important element}} in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E
40|$|Reported <b>sex</b> drive <b>was</b> {{recently}} {{found to be}} positively associated with heterosexual women's attraction to {{both men and women}} (Lippa, 2006). This finding was interpreted as evidence <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> drive <b>is</b> a generalized energizer of women's sexual behaviors and responses, rather than energizing behavior and responses towards potential mates only. Here we show <b>that</b> reported <b>sex</b> drive <b>is</b> positively associated with heterosexual women's preferences for sexual dimorphism in both men's and women's faces (Studies 1 and 2). These findings complement those reported by Lippa (2006), since our own studies and Lippa's show <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> drive <b>is</b> positively associated with heterosexual women's judgments of both men and women. Our findings for associations between reported sex drive and women's preferences for sexual dimorphism implicate sex drive as a possible source of individual differences in women's face preferences and present novel converging evidence <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> drive <b>is</b> a generalized energizer of women's sexual behaviors and responses...|$|R

2500|$|These {{findings}} on sexuality in Giardia, above, {{have important implications}} for understanding the origin of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. [...] Even though sexual reproduction is widespread among extant eukaryotes, it seemed unlikely, until recently, <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> a primordial and fundamental feature of eukaryotes. [...] A probable reason for the view that sex may not be fundamental to eukaryotes was that sexual reproduction previously appeared to be lacking in certain human pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes (e.g. Giardia) that diverged from early ancestors in the eukaryotic lineage.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation, also {{published}} as Sexual Desire: A Moral Philosophy of the Erotic, is a 1986 {{book about the}} philosophy of sex by the philosopher Roger Scruton, in which the author argues <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy. Sexual Desire has received praise from reviewers, and {{has been seen as}} one of the most important works in the philosophy of sex, but has also been criticized for Scruton's treatment of topics such as homosexuality and sociobiology, and his claim that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person. Some critics described Sexual Desire as [...] "silly".|$|E

Another modern tantrika is Daniel Odier who believes that desire can be a valid pathway to transcendence. Sexologists, porn star and mother of Yoni massage Annie Sprinkle and Joseph Kramer and father of Lingham massage are two examples of practitioners who teach sacred erotic massage.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual narcissism {{has been}} {{described}} as an egocentric pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement. [...] In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself. [...] Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy. This behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to domestic violence in men and sexual coercion in couples. Hurlbert argues <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction. [...] He and his colleagues assert that any sexual addiction {{is nothing more than a}} misnomer for what is actually sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity. While Hurlbert writes mainly of sexual narcissism in men, Schoenewolf (2013) describes what he calls [...] "gender narcissism" [...] which occurs in both males and females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud and obsessed with their masculinity or femininity.|$|E

2500|$|When {{incubated}} {{with their}} bacterial food supply, heterothallic or homothallic sexual development can occur, {{resulting in the}} formation of a diploid zygote. [...] Heterothallic mating occurs when two amoebae of different mating types are present in a dark and wet environment, where they can fuse during aggregation to form a giant zygote cell. The giant cell then releases cAMP to attract other cells, then engulfs the other cells cannibalistically in the aggregate. The consumed cells serve to encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a macrocyst. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through meiosis, then through mitosis to produce many haploid amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would. Homothallic D. discoideum strains AC4 and ZA3A are also able to produce macrocysts. [...] Each of these strains, unlike heterothallic strains, likely express both mating type alleles (matA and mata). [...] While sexual reproduction is possible, it is very rare to see successful germination of a D. discoideum macrocyst under laboratory conditions. [...] Nevertheless, recombination is widespread within D. discoideum natural populations, indicating <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> likely an important aspect of their lifecycle.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing sexual perversion, Scruton {{argues that}} its [...] "major {{structural}} feature" [...] is the [...] "complete or partial failure to recognise, {{in and through}} desire, the personal existence of the other", {{which in turn is}} [...] "an affront, both to him and oneself." [...] Scruton calls perversion, [...] "narcissistic, often solipsistic". In his chapter on perversion, Scruton considers masturbation, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, and fetishism. Scruton argues that there are two forms of masturbation, and only one is perverted. Scruton argues that homosexuality is significantly different from heterosexuality, and that this helps to explain the traditional judgment that homosexuality is a perversion. Heterosexuality involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, whereas homosexuality does not: [...] "Desire directed towards the other gender elicits not its simulacrum but its complement." [...] Scruton writes that, [...] "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out from my body towards the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own." [...] Scruton dismisses the classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978) as [...] "trivialising" [...] and faults Michael Levin's arguments for the abnormality of homosexuality, calling them absurd. In Scruton's view, normal sexuality involves not only giving recognition to the other's person in and through desire for him or her, but also according them accountability and care in the process. Scruton argues <b>that</b> <b>sex</b> <b>is</b> morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy.|$|E
