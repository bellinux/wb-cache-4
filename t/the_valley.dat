5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor, gradually moving back up the slopes as <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>valley</b> {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located on either side of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> and to the west, a scarp cuts across <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

Formerly a fertile lake and valley, Owens Lake and the southern portion of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> are now dry.

5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California gave <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> with twenty-mule teams. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E

5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along the western edge of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> passing {{to the west of the}} communities of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E
