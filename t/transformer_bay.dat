40|$|When a transformer's winding {{gets too}} hot, either the load {{has to be}} reduced as a {{short-term}} solution or another <b>transformer</b> <b>bay</b> needs to be installed as a long-term solution. To decide on whether and when to employ either of these two strategies, one needs be able to predict the transformer temperature accurately. There are several transformer models for predicting top-oil temperature. These include the traditional top-oil-rise model, top-oil model and semi-physical model.

40|$|To {{monitor and}} protect the power system the energy flow is to be measure. To connect a meter, relay or other current sensing device in series with a large current source would be impractical. Current Transformer is a device that {{has been around for}} a long time and will monitor the {{electrical}} power system. The current transformer is measuring device to determine current flow in a power system. For the reliable and correct operation of the protection relays, the current transformer has to be carefully chosen. The distortion of the secondary current of a saturated CT may endanger the operation, selectivity and co-ordination of the protection. This dissertation proposing the selection of a CT, thus enables fast and reliable protection. In this dissertation the calculation of the actual accuracy limit factor (ALF) for protection type (P) current transformer (CT) is described. First the calculation of the Voltage knee point and the burden of the CT, including connection wires and protection relay impedance, are presented. The scope of this calculation involves the cost, value and the safety of protection in power. The CT accuracy primary limit current defines the highest fault current magnitude at which the CT will need the specified accuracy. Beyond this level, the secondary current of the CT will be distorted, and this may cause severe effects on the performance of the protection relay. This dissertation is based on PMU PERLING substation and all the CT data are collected accordingly for calculation purposes. The ii modeling of Current transformer containing 5 - CT Core 1 – Transformer Biased Differential Protection, Core 2 – Transformer High Impedance Protection, Core 3 – Back-up Distance Protection and Core 4 & Core 5 – High Impedance Busbar Protection (Main and Check) and used as for designing using GUI, MATLAB software. The simulation of this has been investigated and the CT is suitable for this protection through any variable changes of 275 / 132 KV auto <b>transformer</b> <b>bay</b> and line parameters. This modeling also shows the comparison between the transient analysis which proves according the CT Data at the PMU Perling Substation. The modeling of CT was developed by using GUI, Matlab software and analysis of CT calculation and equation has showed the performance results. It can be concluded that the change of certain parameters will causes the CT to be adequate or inadequate of the protection system and CT has to be carefully chosen...|$|E

40|$|Substations (HV/MV) connect {{transmission}} and distribution systems with consumers of electric energy. The selective search method was used for calculation of substation reliability, where all arrangement elements were grouped into blocks. Subject of the analysis was H-arrangements comprising air-insulated switchgears on the high voltage side of HV/MV substations with different number of feeder and <b>transformer</b> <b>bays</b> and diverse scope of the installed switching equipment. Failure rate and duration were used as main HV/MV substation equipment reliability indices. A large number of arrangements were classified into groups, and within a group the arrangements were ranked {{with the use of}} multiple criteria. It is shown that the reliability of the electricity transit depends on the equipment of field for the transit of electricity, which favors poorly equipped field. On the other hand, the reliability of transformation of the full power depends mostly on the equipment in coupling field. It is essential that in the coupling field, {{there are at least two}} disconnectors. Installation of the switch in the coupling field is meaningful only with appropriate protection, because it further improves reliability. Conclusions are drawn for phased construction and expansion of the single pole diagram with an additional field for the transmission line...|$|R

40|$|Capítulos en librosDuring {{the last}} ten years Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica has built a {{considerable}} number of high voltage/medium voltage transformer stations in urban areas using high voltage (220 kV and 132 kV) Gas Insulated Substations (GISs). The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line <b>bays,</b> two <b>transformer</b> <b>bays</b> and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either insulated cables or Gas Insulated Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the insulated cables or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using insulated cables. 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, insulated cables, GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the insulated cables and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} 2009 - 2013, {{investments}} in the Swedish national grid increase {{by a factor of}} ten compared to previous years. In order to fulfil their mission to manage the national grid in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound way, Svenska Kraftnät (Swedish National Grid) needs to take all these perspectives into account while planning new investments. To compare and relate perspectives of technology, economy and environment the same yard stick must be used. That yard stick is commonly money. A problem arises however as environmental issues are difficult to price. The purpose of this master’s degree project was to develop a tool for evaluation of environmental impact related to {{investments in the}} Swedish national grid. It was initiated by and conducted at the unit for Grid development at Svenska Kraftnät. A life cycle perspective was used and the following stages were identified: material production, construction, operation and decommissioning. The environmental impact from these stages was sorted into ten impact categories using the LCIA method ReCiPe 2008 and then two economical evaluations were performed: one at midpoint level and one at endpoint level. Also included in the evaluation were the change in power losses or in the power production mix and the visual impact coming from overhead transmission lines. Impact categories Type Unit Part of economic evaluation Climate change Midpoint kg CO 2 eq Midpoint evaluation Ozone depletion Midpoint kg CFC- 11 eq No Particle formation Midpoint kg PM 10 eq Midpoint evaluation Acidification Midpoint kg SO 2 eq Midpoint evaluation Eutrophication Midpoint kg P eq Midpoint evaluation Use of metallic resources Midpoint kg Fe eq No Use of fossile resources Midpoint kg oil eq No Damage on human health Endpoint DALY Endpoint evaluation Damage on ecosystem quality Endpoint disappeared species per year Endpoint evaluation Resource depletion Endpoint Endpoint evaluation The tool was implemented in Excel and offers the possibility to evaluate the environmental impact from five different power line technologies (per km), substation line <b>bays</b> (per <b>bay),</b> <b>transformers</b> (per piece) and reactors (per piece). The main results show that AC land cable has a significantly higher environmental impact and cost than the other power line technologies. Material production and construction are the life cycle stages that contribute the most to the environmental cost. The impact categories that affect the environmental cost the most are climate change (for midpoint evaluation) and resource depletion (for endpoint evaluation). When the investment affects the power production mix, e. g. by changing the transmission capacity to another country, the subsequent environmental impact can be very influential on the total environmental cost of the investment...|$|R
