25|$|An ogbanje is a reincarnating evil {{spirit that}} would {{deliberately}} plague {{a family with}} misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under {{a certain amount of}} time (usually before puberty), would deliberately die and <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits Iyi-uwa, which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The Iyi-uwa is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.|$|E

25|$|Fever during {{treatment}} can {{be due to}} a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled and <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, Richard went on Montreal {{radio to}} ask fans to cease rioting, and instead support the Canadiens in the playoffs; {{he offered to}} take his punishment <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> the following year to win the Cup. While the Canadiens were eliminated in the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals, Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup. [...] The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada; the riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. Campbell's decision to suspend Richard was widely supported by fans outside of Quebec. Some, including Detroit's Ted Lindsay, said the suspension did {{not go far enough}} and argued Richard, a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history, should have been banned for life.|$|E

500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E

[...] "Gone for Goode" [...] included guest appearances by actors who later become much more widely known. Steve Harris, who later achieved fame playing Eugene Young on the ABC legal drama The Practice, played an uncooperative suspect who repeatedly lies to Munch during questioning. Alexander Chaplin, who later played speechwriter James Hobert on the ABC sitcom Spin City, portrayed the alleged murderer Johnny in [...] "Gone for Goode". The comedic confession scenes involving Jim Grollman as accused murderer Jerry Jempson were almost entirely improvised.|$|E

500|$|Fuller readily agreed, having focused {{much of his}} {{own career}} on racial issues. Already {{familiar}} with the novel and {{with the concept of}} [...] "white dogs," [...] he was tasked with [...] "reconceptualizing" [...] the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would [...] "see a dog slowly go insane and <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to sanity." [...] Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a [...] "second-rate novel" [...] and questioned its use when [...] "bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H.

Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and read it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, [...] "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E

500|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} prefer {{to swim in}} waters of [...] Their daily {{movement}} {{is influenced by the}} tides; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides. Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand, surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills. They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down: the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust. The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray, and repeated four to five times rapidly. The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group, from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins. The rays also performs dips and jumps; in a dip the ray will dive and <b>then</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> up rapidly, perhaps as many as five times consecutively. There are two main types of jump: in one, the ray propels itself vertically out of the water, to which it returns along the same line; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45degree angle, often repeated multiple times at high speeds. When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone, but they do also congregate in schools. One form of traveling is called loose aggregation, which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group, with occasional interactions between them. A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed.|$|E
