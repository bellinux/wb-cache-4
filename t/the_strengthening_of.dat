Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted Emilia to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs' climatologically weak nature during the summer. This led to high confidence in the forecasts, resulting in a lack of watches or warnings. Nonetheless, a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands.|$|E
