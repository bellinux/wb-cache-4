Bono said of the song: [...] "Its quite a question, but <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> mark on it," [...] as the band took the question mark off the title of the song for fearing it would be perceived as [...] "too heavy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reception of [...] "Light On" [...] was {{generally}} positive to mixed. Billboards Chuck Taylor said that [...] "melodically, <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that this bullet is heading {{right for the}} brain, where the only thing stickier than the chorus is Cooks appreciably sweaty performance". He predicted success for Cook, stating [...] "Like Chris Daughtry before him, heres an Idol who is bound for true rock cred", summing it up with [...] "Light On" [...] is right on." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{surprising}} {{aspect of}} Hinz character are his (very seldom) intellectual thoughts.Example: {{when he has}} to interview fictional expert Stolte-Benrad (Patrick Frey) concerning Iraq, he awkwardly searches the question list, while the expert gets angry. The expert starts talking despite <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question,</b> but suddenly, Fredi interrupts him and claims, that the expert is wrong, because the discussed [...] "region obviously was coined monotheistic". He shows bits of deep knowledge and blames the expert for a short moment - just to start talking about [...] "black Afghan", [...] "red Lebanese" [...] and other types of the regions [...] "shit" [...] (hemp) afterwards again.|$|E

5000|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco {{rated the}} show highly, calling it [...] "one {{of the most}} violent, and {{certainly}} the most frightening, series ever made by a commercial broadcast network," [...] adding [...] "some plot twists seem implausible at best, others are overdone or gratuitous. But some implausibility comes with the horror/suspense genre, and <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> Kevin Williamson has mastered it — just as <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that the match of wills between the wounded Kevin Bacon and malevolent James Purefoy is exceedingly well played." ...|$|R
5000|$|Guillou {{received}} {{payment from}} KGB for written reports on Swedish politics, and Expressen points to this fact when defending its choice {{to refer to}} Guillou as a secret agent”. Former KGB Colonel and defector Sergey Tretyakov characterised Guillou as a [...] "classic agent". [...] "Because he accepted money and, worst of all, signed receipts, <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> about it. The handling of him could be a schoolbook example at the KGB school in Moscow". Espionage prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand wrote to PON that [...] "Agent and spy are not synonymous ideas .... an agent {{does not have to}} commit acts of espionage. An agent can perform assignments for his handler without crossing the line to what is prosecutable." ...|$|E
5000|$|Erica Abeel of The Hollywood Reporter writes [...] "New York, I Love You {{continues}} the Cities of Love series {{that began with}} Paris, je taime far surpassing it. (...) The vignettes are tied together into a single feature through a recurrent character, a videographer who interacts with the other characters. And transitional elements -- choreographed by 11th director Randy Balsmeyer -- move the viewer from one world to another, uniting all these intimate stories into a single shimmering fabric." [...] "With younger, less-tested directing talent, the film plays down the delineation between one directors work and another, opting to blend them through loosely interconnected characters here and there. As opposed to its directing roster, however, the cast boasts quite a few big names, all of which lend a surprising amount of authenticity to these funny, imaginative little stories," [...] explains Heidi Patalano of Metro New York giving the film a 4 grade out of 5. Claudia Puig of USA Today explains that anthologies are {{by their very nature}} an uneven entity and adds [...] "The multicultural emphasis - both in characters and in the unusual selection and collaboration of filmmakers and artists - is one of New York, I Love Yous main assets. And <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Manhattan looks ever-vibrant and beautiful." ...|$|E
5000|$|Harrisons co-star, James Franciscus, {{remember}}ed her fondly:"Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I remember we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. Youre galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and hes running like a bat out of hell and Lindas behind me saying, Im very nervous about this horse. And I said, Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you cant do it, just dont do it. Its risky. <b>Theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> about it, its not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell. But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,Youre crazy. I wouldnt have done that. Its too dangerous. And hes probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shields {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 86, based on 36 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Pitchfork Medias Lindsay Zoladz gave the album a Best New Music designation, writing [...] "While <b>theres</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Grizzly Bears last two records have sounded gorgeous, {{critics of the}} band have wondered if thats enough. Shields, the bands fourth and most compositionally adventurous record, should put those concerns to bed. Though full of baroque, detail-rich production and latticework melodies, Shields also offers an emotionally resonant core." [...] In another positive review, AllMusics Heather Phares wrote: [...] "While its not as obviously big a statement as Veckatimest was, Shields is plenty ambitious in its own right, and its complexity demands and rewards patient listening." [...] The A.V. Clubs Chris DeVille praised the contributions of Chris Taylor and Christopher Bear, stating, [...] "On an album that touches repeatedly on the barriers people build between each other, the members of Grizzly Bear have forged further ahead into sweet synchronicity. Sam Cleeve of Drowned in Sound called Shields [...] ".. A warm-blooded record, beholden to analogue gear and flawless mastering — one destined to fit snugly on a turntable rather than to live as ones and zeros on your iPod", while PopMatters Robert Alford called it [...] "an album that unveils deeper levels of emotional impact and aesthetic dimension for a band that continues to challenge and captivate {{in ways that are}} entirely their own." ...|$|E
