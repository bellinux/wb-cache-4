5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b> After the {{communist}} takeover {{of power in}} Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of organizations {{in the country and}} tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations. Therefore, many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b> The ones who still operated were subjected to rising pressure since 1951. Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|After 1952 the Polish sport {{life was}} {{organized}} through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date, hence {{after the fall}} of communism in 1989 only a few sport organizations resumed <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b> Beskid Śląski, the only notable one, focuses on tourism. No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie.|$|E

5|$|Common {{locations}} {{for the start}} of seizures and neural networks {{have been found to be}} affected in the majority of epilepsy. Efforts to figure out how epilepsy occurs is working to take into account the different regions of the brain and the timing of <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Different {{branches}} of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. Lesser deities {{also may be}} promoted or demoted for <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b> Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor, derived from the main of the Three Purities, as {{a representation of the}} most high God.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E

5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Major {{pieces were}} created at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising <b>their</b> <b>activity.</b> Some of the pieces assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.|$|E
30|$|Fewer than 40 % of the {{responding}} CDEs {{in each of}} the professions surveyed were satisfied with the current state of <b>their</b> <b>activities</b> and contributions as a CDE. For CDEs, “lack of labor” is the most concerning issue that limits <b>their</b> satisfactory <b>activities</b> as CDEs, followed by “condition of facilities”. Other factors such as insufficient “interprofessional teamwork”, “limited personal ability”, “mismatched allocation”, and “low recognition for CDEs” also limited <b>their</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|R

5|$|Reduce {{proteolytic}} susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} proteins are broken down can have a large impact on <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> in cells. Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease <b>their</b> <b>activity,</b> for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, the Indonesians {{planned to}} {{increase}} <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit Knuckle areas, while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased {{in order to}} detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} Ottoman authority, Murat II appointed native Albanians like Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg to high positions within the sanjak of Albania. The nobles who accepted Ottoman overlordship were granted their pre-Ottoman holdings and border estates {{as well as}} a degree of autonomy, while others were exiled or continued warring. In 1436–37, rebels were active in the regions of Gjirokastër and Vlorë and Teodor Korona Muzaka led a revolt in the region of Berat. As many rebels used Venetian territories like Shkodër and Parga as bases to launch raids into Ottoman territory, representatives of Mehmed II asked the Venetians to outlaw <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> in October 1436.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money if they can find naughty little boys {{for him to take}} to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce <b>their</b> <b>activity,</b> Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland, {{starting}} World War II in Europe, {{and subsequently}} made Zaolzie {{part of the}} Military district of Upper Silesia. On 26 October 1939 Nazi Germany unilaterally annexed Zaolzie as part of Landkreis Teschen. During the war, strong Germanization was introduced by the authorities. The Jews were in the worst position, followed by the Poles. Poles received lower food rations, {{they were supposed to}} pay extra taxes, they were not allowed to enter theatres, cinemas, etc. Polish and Czech education ceased to exist, Polish organizations were dismantled and <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> was prohibited. Katowice's Bishop Adamski was deposed as apostolic administrator for the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie and on 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, nuncio to Germany, returned them to their original archdioceses of Breslau or Olomouc, respectively, with effect of 1 January 1940.|$|E
