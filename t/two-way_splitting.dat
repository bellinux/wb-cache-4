40|$|Three-dimensional wave-equation {{migration}} {{techniques are}} still quite expensive {{because of the}} huge matrices {{that need to be}} inverted. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce this cost by splitting the full 3 D problem into a sequence of 2 D problems. We compare the performance of splitting techniques for stable 3 D Fourier finite-difference (FFD) migration techniques in terms of image quality and computational cost. The FFD methods are complex Padé FFD and FFD plus interpolation, and the compared splitting techniques are two- and four-way splitting as well as alternating four-way splitting, that is, splitting into the coordinate directions at one depth and the diagonal directions at the next depth level. From numerical examples in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, we conclude that, though theoretically less accurate, alternate four-way splitting yields results of comparable quality as full four-way splitting at the cost of <b>two-way</b> <b>splitting...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Fourier finite-difference propagator and the generalized-screen propagator are {{two general}} {{high-order}} forms of one-way dual-domain methods. We compare these two propagators mainly on phase accuracy, computational efficiency and 3 D exten-sion. A comparison of phase accuracy {{shows that the}} high-order generalized-screen propagator is preferable to the Fourier finite-difference propagator for heterogeneous media with a weak velocity contrast and wide dip angle. With increasing veloc-ity contrast, the accuracy improvement gained by the high-order generalized-screen propagator declines rapidly. The Fourier finite-difference propagator is more robust and flexible to lateral velocity variations than the generalized-screen propagator. The 2 D Fourier finite-difference propagator is superior to the 2 D generalized-screen prop-agator when the velocity contrast is stronger than 23 %. Despite the <b>two-way</b> <b>splitting</b> error, the 3 D Fourier finite-difference propagator is more accurate than the second-order generalized-screen propagator when the velocity contrast is stronger than 20 % and is more accurate than the fourth-order generalized-screen propagator when th...|$|E

40|$|The working {{principle}} of static mixers {{is based on}} repeated stretching, cutting, and stackingoperations. <b>Two-way</b> <b>splitting</b> (cutting) elements are most commonly used. Multiple splittingelements increase the compactness of the mixer, but an issue is the pressure consumption. Here we first investigate how to improve existing two way splitting and recombining flows. We use the serpentine channel geometry which relevance {{is that it is}} easy to fabricate on theinterface between two halves of a mold or device. Next a parallel multiple splitting method isdeveloped which is compact and efficient in terms of pressure consumption and uniformity ofthe resulting layer distribution. The final design represents a fully parallel multiple mixer,circularly shaped, that uses fan shaped channels (for a uniform flow length distribution) toguide the flow to its splitting channels, where it is turned and recollected in a second fanshaped channel. Because of its twelve-way parallel splitting design, the device produces 24 layers in one mixing element and 288 layers in the second element and so on. Prototypes arefabricated, tested on performance, and compared with some existing static mixers usingmixing speed, volume, length, and pressuredrop as criteria.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} unaccusativity {{on the basis of}} the learnability of the perfective auxiliary by English native speakers of Dutch as a second language. The unaccusative/unergative divide between intransitive verbs has been shown to apply across languages and is widely considered to be innate, although the syntactic manifestations differ between languages. One of the most salient distinctions between unaccusative and unergative verbs is the choice of either HAVE or BE as the perfective auxiliary, and Dutch is one language that makes such a distinction. In a series of papers Sorace (1993, 2000, 2004) suggests that the divide is more complex than a <b>two-way</b> <b>split</b> and that auxiliary selection is gradient, with verbs that fall into certain categories being more consistent in their auxiliary choice both within and across languages, and also more easily learnable. This gradience is summarised in the Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy. This paper describes an experiment investigating the interlanguage of Dutch L 2 speakers. The findings show a strong tendency for the selection of BE for unaccusative verbs, and also a slight gradient effect in accordance with the ASH...|$|R

40|$|Zoning {{is defined}} as the {{delineation}} of areas within a State where duck hunting seasons are set independently of each other. The purpose of zoning is to provide a more equitable distribution of duck harvest opportunity among hunters in a given State. States are allowed the option of splitting their allotted hunting days into two (or in some cases, three) segments to take advantage of species-specific peaks of abundance or to satisfy hunters in different areas who want to hunt during the period of peak waterfowl abundance in their area. The Service’s current zoning/split criteria allow States the following options: (1) Three zones with no splits (2) Split seasons (no more than three segments) with no zones (3) Two zones with the option for <b>two-way</b> <b>split</b> seasons in one or both zones.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a cross-linguistic and intercultural {{perspective}} of child’s speech development in its multimodal and semiotic aspects. Research on gesture as well as cognitive science has presented data that show that the listener, or speaker, integrates auditory and visual information from linguistic, prosodic and gesture sources into a single message (McNeill, 1992, 2005; Beattie, 2003; Goldin-Meadow, 2006). In recent studies, the study of semantic systems of languages {{has proven to be}} relevant in that differences exist in how languages conceptualise the world. Bernicot (2000) postulated that pragmatic features rely on the social and cultural context of a given language. The typology proposed by Leonard Talmy (Talmy, 1985), has been a cornerstone in the investigation of the role of grammatical and semantic structure of a language and its influence on its speakers. Talmy’s typology is based on the linguistic encoding of events. He proposed a <b>two-way</b> <b>split</b> tendency 2 of all languages in terms of how a “motion ” event and “path ” and “manner ” are packaged linguistically (Talmy 1985, 1991; Özçaliskan & Slobin, 2003). Languages who use motion verbs to incorporate information about path are called “verb framed ” (V-Language, which include Romance languages) and languages that convey path of movement by verbs are called “satellite-framed ” (S-Language, which include Germanic languages).

Yoga as an anxiolytic tool in anxiety reduction has been practiced over centuries in India. Aim: To assess the efficacy of yoga in reducing the state trait anxiety of dental students before their first periodontal surgery performance. Settings and Design: A randomized controlled study using a <b>two-way</b> <b>split</b> plot design (pre-post-test) was conducted {{in the department of}} periodontics, Pacific Dental College, Udaipur, India. Materials and Methods: One hundred clinical dental students who were ready to perform their first periodontal surgery were selected. Students were randomly assigned to two groups and were given a 60 -min session on stress reduction. Group A, yogic intervention group, were instructed to do yoga and their performances were monitored for a period of one week and Group B, control group, were given a lecture on stress reduction without any yoga instructions. The investigator who was unaware of the groups had taken the state trait anxiety score of the students three times a) before assigning them to each group, b) prior to the surgical procedure and c) immediately after the performance of surgery. Statistical Analysis Used: Analyses of variance (ANOVA) by SPSS V. 16. Results: The statistical results showed a significant reduction in the VAS and state trait anxiety of Group A compared to Group B (ANOVA; P< 0. 001).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a <b>two-way</b> <b>split</b> between a {{practical}} case study and a theoretical angle {{to a more}} general problem. As the cardinal question bears to witness, {{the first part of}} the thesis revolves round the case, and the second part debates the more general questions posed. Cardinal question: How does KKL’s identity construction influence the communication potential of the organization in a post-modern society? And how does a culturally founded organization navigate in a globalized world? Basically, we are dealing with the cultural differences a strongly religiously and nationally founded organization experiences when entering an increasingly international arena. We attempt to uncover how this affects the organization itself, and, more interestingly, where these mechanisms lie, behind the cultural clashes, and how to deal with them. We address these issues on a strictly organizational level as well as a wider communicational level, in order to uncover the tools to deal with cultural clashes in a broader sense than just our case. Our case is an Israeli environmental organization, which has expressed a need for discovering new target audiences for the further development of the organization’s potential internationally. Due to the narrow problem targeting we focus mainly on identity construction internally within the organization, and the external communication as an imminent result. Our goal is thus to present an inspirational paper for the organization, but also, more importantly, to uncover the cultural communication mechanisms in a theoretical and intellectual manner for the benefit of the thesis, and thereby produce new knowledge. Our findings show that this approach is feasible, and in fact provides a very helpful set of tools, when operating in a cultural environment such as KKL. In short, we found that terms such as ‘self recognition’ and ‘transparency’ both play a major part in overcoming cultural boundaries when forming a working communication strategy...|$|R
