25|$|Glass is an {{amorphous}} solid. It exhibits {{an atomic}} structure {{close to that}} observed in the supercooled liquid phase but displays all the mechanical properties of a solid. The notion <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> flows to an appreciable extent over {{extended periods of time}} is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity of amorphous materials). Laboratory measurements of room temperature glass flow do show a motion consistent with a material viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa s.|$|E
25|$|Renaissance Europe {{witnessed}} {{the revitalization of}} glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the Venetian glassworkers from Murano to produce the fine glassware which {{is also known as}} cristallo. The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for window panes in the late 17th century. The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> was being blown {{in many parts of the}} world, for example, in China, Japan and the Islamic Lands.|$|E

Convinced <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> would revive their sagging investment, the partners asked the Germans {{to set up shop}} in New Geneva. Gallatin was appalled with the idea, and considered it to be a gamble. Nonetheless, production of glass began on January 18, 1798. Window glass, whiskey bottles, and other hollow ware were produced. This was the first glass blown west of the Alleghenies.|$|E

25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, {{there must be something}} about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E
25|$|His father, Robert Henry Glass, was Lynchburg's {{postmaster}} {{beginning in}} 1853, and in 1858 bought the Lynchburg Daily Republican newspaper (where {{he had worked}} since 1846). The city's other newspaper was the Lynchburg Daily Virginian, then published by Joseph Button, who on June 23, 1860 (while R.H. Glass was out of town) died in a duel with Glass's editor at the time, George W. Hardwicke, over accusations <b>that</b> <b>Glass</b> used his postal office to disadvantage the rival paper. Major Glass ultimately remarried and had seven additional children, including Meta Glass (president of Sweet Briar College) and Edward Christian Glass (who served as Lynchburg's school superintendent for five decades).|$|E
25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E

40|$|Environment {{models are}} {{resources}} that enable robots {{to perform their}} tasks more reliably, efficiently, and competently by using information about the environments. Robots that are to perform everyday manipulation tasks in human living environments must have environment models that are much more comprehensive and richer than the models that have been employed by robots so far. It {{is not sufficient to}} simply have a representation of the spatial layout of the environment together with perceptual descriptions of locations as it is sufficient for navigation. Also, environment models that contain object models and semantic information are not sufficient for carrying out activities of daily life. Consider, for example, a household robot that is to set the table, to load the dishwasher and to clean up. Such a robot must know <b>that</b> clean <b>glasses</b> can typically be found in the cupboard, <b>that</b> <b>glasses</b> on the table are often in use, intended to be used by somebody or dirty, <b>that</b> <b>glasses</b> on the table suggest that people sit or have been sitting there, <b>that</b> <b>glasses</b> are put into the dishwasher to clean them, etc. In human environments, almost every object is designed for certain actions and purposes. As a consequence, there are strong correlations between objects, their locations, their state, and the activity context. These correlations must be known to the robot in order to perform the right action on the right object in the right way...|$|R
25|$|A {{small glass}} {{industry}} existed in Newcastle from the mid-15th century. In 1615 restrictions {{were put on}} the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. Huguenot glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the Ouseburn area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, Sephardic Jewish emigrants from Altare, arrived in Newcastle from Stourbridge and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality flint glass. The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in collier brigs. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light Baluster'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, {{it is clear}} <b>that</b> <b>glass</b> making was a significant industry. By {{the end of the}} Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around {{a relatively small number of}} workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited {{evidence for}} local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.|$|E
