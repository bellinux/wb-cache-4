5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service.

5|$|His plan in tatters, Howe {{responded by}} example, leading his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte towards the French line which was rapidly slipping {{ahead of the}} British, steering around the meandering Caesar as he did so. Queen Charlotte first attempted {{to break through the}} French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to reach this gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship Eole from close range. Bellerophon and Lord Hugh Seymour in Leviathan followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; Bellerophon successfully, Leviathan prevented by damage to her helm. This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the Terrible, Tyrannicide, and Indomptable, forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thousands of Jewish refugee {{children}} {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street {{in the late}} 1930s {{as part of the}} Kindertransport rescue mission <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>them</b> in the run up to World War II. The Für Das Kind Kindertransport Memorial sculpture by artist Flor Kent was installed at the station in September 2003 commemorating this event.

He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>them</b> from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E
5|$|Passing over Okinawa with {{a central}} {{pressure}} of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg), Bolaven {{became one of the}} most intense typhoons to ever strike the region. Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick to reach him, he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two boys were swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>them</b> but later drowned. The two boys were later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard. Although the storm did not strike the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu. Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds. Throughout Japan, losses to agriculture and fisheries amounted to ¥423.28million (US$5.39million).|$|E
