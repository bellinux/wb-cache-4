40|$|A {{new model}} for land use {{planning}} Cue: Africa is well known as a continent rich in natural resources. However, if those resources are to bring prosperity and development, how they are used and managed is clearly critical. But who {{has the right to}} decide how the resources should be used? Local communities? Town councils? Government ministries or planning departments? An obvious answer is that it depends on who owns the land, but in many areas ownership is disputed. In much of rural South Africa, as elsewhere, two different systems of land ownership exist side-by-side, the formal system based on legal documents, and traditional systems rooted in local culture. Not surprisingly, reaching agreements on how land should be used in this context can be extremely difficult, and may lead to open conflict. According to Pat Luckin, a land use planner working in South Africa, preventing conflict and developing agreement over land use depends on involving local communities in planning, and creating better communication between the communities and other interest groups. In recent work with two communities, Pat has experimented with a new approach which she believes has greatly improved that communication process, and has given people a much better understanding of the resources that they have. She spoke to Susanna Thorp about the new approach and the way it has been used. IN:		?I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> ? OUT:		? reduction of conflict in certain areas. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Pat Luckin, on some new approaches to {{land use planning}} that have recently been piloted in South Africa. Transcript Luckin	I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> to realise when one deals with planning processes is trust, and that people participate in the planning process. Now that?s quite difficult with the formal planning tools that we have which are quite abstract and often come from other countries and sometimes aren?t applicable to our local conditions. So what we?ve done is we built three-dimensional models, physical models, so people can physically see the land and touch a model. Immediately people then identify where they live, where their schools are, where the rivers are, where the hills are, where the forests are etc. Thorp	So how has that made a difference in the way that people have worked together and if they have identified these things, how have they then used those results? Luckin	What we have done in our communities is we have brought people together, traditional leaders, women, other community members, people with disabilities, {{to make sure that we}} have a good range of people living in that particular area and ensure that they can participate on how land in that particular area should be used. Obviously one does this in an area where people are demanding a change in land use or more appropriate land use or where there are some conflicts in land use and people need to resolve these problems. So bring all the different parties together around the model and they just start discussing how they want to use different pieces of land. Thorp	Now you mentioned that there had previously been a lot of conflict. Has this process allowed some of those conflicts to be resolved, can you give me examples? Luckin	Often when one has large areas of land, like particularly in South Africa, there is often distrust or lack of communication between different sectors of communities, between traditional leaders and municipalities, and what these particular projects have facilitated is that by bringing the people together around the model, we?ve had municipal officials, we?ve had traditional leaders, we?ve had elders and women all talking around the same issues and agreeing and understanding one another. And I think that the modeling process has huge potential for helping people to genuinely communicate with one another and realise that they are much closer to one another than they had thought before, and that they all have the same intention which is the management of land and the development of a particular area concerned. Thorp	So a very powerful tool obviously, but you?ve only used it in two communities? Luckin		Very small, yes. Thorp	How would you take this process on now? Are there lessons that you have learned that you would perhaps do differently or is this something that you would like to try elsewhere? Luckin	Oh yes well the responsibility of using models in a community are very huge. So as I said earlier they must be based on trust. There is certain information in communities relating to biodiversity, relating to plants and animals which have specific significance to communities which they might not want to divulge and they have the right to keep that information private and within the community and not make it public, particularly relating to medicinal plants where people invariably get exploited. Next time I go into a community we would write up protocols of how the information would be managed, who would own the information, how much of it would become mapped in a public map for public consumption and how much of it would be kept within the community. It does not solve all problems there are obviously lots of other land legal problems which require other kinds of solutions but it definitely can facilitate the reduction of conflict in certain areas.

40|$|Fair trade {{marketing}} - an ethical edge CUE: Fair Trade is an innovation in marketing {{that has been}} particularly important for small-scale producers. Companies that follow ?Fair trade? principles give their products an ethical value by always paying producers a fair price for their goods. This has proved a successful marketing strategy as increasing numbers of consumers, particularly in wealthier countries, are choosing fair trade products, even when these are more expensive than other brands. But what about selling fair trade goods in Africa? Are local consumers ready {{to pay more for}} a fairly produced commodity? In this next report, Eric Kadenge talks to Farouk Jiwa of Honey Care Africa, a company that for two years has been developing small-scale bee-keeping in Kenya. Farouk explains why Honey Care decided to get into honey production, and how the company is trying to persuade Kenyans to pay more for its ethical honey. IN:		?We came into the market ? OUT:		? right across the country. DUR?N	 4 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Farouk Jiwa of Honey Care Africa, on the importance of having a quality product for successful marketing. Transcript Jiwa	We came into the market primarily because we realised there was a vacuum that existed, the way bee-keeping was being done in Kenya, there was really no progress being made. We?ve developed something called the Langstroth beehive, and have found innovative mechanisms through which farmers can get access to these beehives quickly, under a credit facility or a loan facility through NGOs. Honey Care then provides training wherever possible, and most importantly, Honey Care provides a guaranteed market for the farmers. We go out to the farmers farms, we collect the honey on the spot, and the cash payments are made directly to the farmers on the day of collection of the honey. And that has been probably the most important incentive that Honey Care can provide towards the development of a bee-keeping sector in this country. Kadenge	And I?m curious to know what kind of people constitute your farmers, what is their economic status in Kenya for example? Jiwa	Our farmers tend to be smallholder farmers, with average plot size of between five acres to a quarter of an acre. They are almost about 43 % women now, because we have done a very important thing in terms of introducing bee-keeping to women. We have taken the hives off the trees, brought them down to eye-level, and ensured that women can get involved in bee-keeping as well. Kadenge	So once you have the honey from the farmer, what then do you do with it? Jiwa	We then bring the honey down to Nairobi where it is processed in our factory. We then work on pasteurising the honey, incubating the honey, and it is eventually bottled. The honey then goes out under the Honey Care Africa brand name. We have four different flavours of honey, depending on the area that the honey comes from. There is ?Highland Blend?, ?African Blossom?, ?Acacia? and ?Wild Comb? honey. These then go out into the market locally. They are supplied to most of the hotels, the airlines and various supermarkets as well. Kadenge	Now given that we have quite a number of other people that produce honey, {{what are some of the}} marketing strategies that you use to make sure that you have an edge over them? Jiwa	I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> we have been able to do is establish ourselves as being a Fair Trade organisation. We do practise fair trade all the way through, during the entire process chain of honey production, which begins from the manufacture of the beehives, right up to the marketing of the honey. We believe in paying a fair price, or a fair wage for whoever is involved in the entire process. If there is a jar of honey that has been produced by a private farmer at 150 shillings, and a jar of honey that has been produced by a community group or a women?s group in a particular area, selling at 200 shillings, we are trying to convince the Kenyan market that it is worthwhile moving more towards supporting community projects, and paying an extra premium. I think in addition to that it is a question of having a consistent quality, having a high quality product that is available throughout the year. If you don?t have a good product, no matter how you package it, it is not going to work. And I would say the third thing we have done as far as marketing is concerned is coming up with more innovative packaging. We?ve done a very good job on our labels, they are hand painted labels, they reflect the various vegetation and species of trees that we have in this country, and that adds to the exotic value of our honey in many ways as well. Kadenge	And given that you have to work with farmers that come from various parts of the country, how do you go about meeting the transport requirement for that? Jiwa	The most important thing is you have to make the farmers organise in economically viable clusters, so it?s financially viable, economically viable to go out and collect the honey from a group of farmers rather than a scattered number of people. It is more to do with logistics and organisation in the field, that makes the transportation cost a lot easier to bear. Kadenge	And how much is the honey consumption in Kenya, and do you see this consumption increasing with time? Jiwa	The consumption is actually quite low for a country like Kenya, especially given the historical background of most of the communities, and the central role that honey has played in various communities and traditions, customs, marriage, initiation, and a whole bunch of other things as well. The main reason for the consumption to be as low as it has been, has been primarily because of the unavailability of high quality Kenyan honey which is of a regularised standard available consistently throughout the year. Consumption of honey primarily has been in its raw form, as honey only. There is a lot of potential for combining honey with other products for example as well. Whether it is going to be honey in cereals, honey in barbecue sauce, whatever it may be. There are a lot of combinations that have not been explored to their fullest, and I think the consumption will definitely increase in the next three to five years. Kadenge	So these are some of the marketing strategies that you intend to use in the coming years? Jiwa	More than anything else, the first platform of our marketing strategy would be to convince people that there is finally an option to the poor quality honey that they have normally seen out here in the market. There is finally a home-grown answer to probably one of the most important food products in terms of a social value and a historical value for our country. The idea would be to convince them that we do now have high quality honey that is available to them at affordable prices right across the country. End of track.

40|$|In {{order to}} know how much {{knowledge}} and awareness about infection control in the nursing students, we analyzed the answers on the questionnaire obtained from 60 students at the beginning of clinical practice. Among them, as 70 % of students answered to know the word of "infection control", whereas 60 % of them did not know the contents of "standard precaution". To questions concerning infection control measures that you should know and practice, and that you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> students cited "handwashing". In relation to this fact, it has been clarified that they practice consciously handwashing during the clinical practice. On the other hand, there were considerable differences in knowledge on microbiology depending on individual student. In particular, the knowledge concerning the infection routes was poor and thereby re-education is suggested to be needed. Taking together, it should be emphasized that the clinical practice has a role to teach them the practical and suitable infection control measures case by case. 臨地実習を開始した看護学生が，感染予防対策をどの程度意識しているかという実態を知る目的で調査を行った．その結果，「感染予防対策」は７０％が知っており，「標準予防策」は６０％が知らなかった．また，感染予防対策として「知っていること」「実施していること」「最も大切に思うこと」のいずれも「手洗い」が多く，エビデンスの理解は薄いが，多くの学生が手洗いの重要性を認識し，実習でも意識的に「手洗い」をしているという現実が明らかとなった．一方，微生物学的知識への問いに関しては，個々の学生間で差がみられ，特に感染経路等に関しては臨地実習を行うにあたり知識の再確認をしていく必要性が示唆された．以上のことより，学生は「感染」という言葉を意識して実習を行ってはいるが，その実際にいたってはいまだ不十分であり，不足している部分を補って実習を進められるような教育方法を今後検討していくことが必要であると考えられた...|$|R
40|$|Nelson's vision is, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{vision in}} <b>the</b> history of computing. That's a tall call, so I'll {{need to explain}} my reasoning. In my book Memory Machines (Barnet 2013) I argue {{that the idea of}} a {{universal}} digital publishing system, an 'open hypermedia' system, originated with Nelson. Bush's vision, though it was about connected items, was analogue. Engelbart's vision was also profoundly important. He was first to build many of the things we take for granted in modern computing (and I don't mean the mouse; I mean the whole concept of real-time, networked, interactive computing). His contributions would take hours to elaborate. But he was not thinking about hypertext as a domestic thing - something your mom and pop would consume over latte and a cheeseburger. Nelson saw that hypertext on a computer screen would spread around the globe like electronic kudzu vine. He wrote singing commercials for it; he even sketched a quirky interior for a Xanadu cafe...|$|R
40|$|Translation can {{be known}} through direct {{engagement}} with the practice or profession, through theoretical propositions, or through empirical applications of theoretical propositions. Here we {{make the argument that}} the repetition of theoretical propositions without empirical application leads to some unhelpful pieces of philosophy. This particularly concerns the following general postulates 1) “translation is difference”, tested on Walter Benjamin’s reference to the untranslatability of words for bread; 2) “translation is survival”, tested on Homi Bhabha’s use of Benjamin and Derrida (who do not survive the use); 3) “translators are authors”, tested on the “alien I”, pseudotranslations and process studies; and 4) “translation is cultural translation”, tested on the subject positions created by a piece of current Germanic theoretical discourse. On all four counts, the case is made that the practice of translation exceeds its theory, thus requiring an ongoing empirical attitude. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> trend has been the shift from philosophical conceptual analysis towards empirical research. (Chesterman 1998 : 201...|$|R
