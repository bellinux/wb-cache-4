5000|$|It grows 1 - 1.5 ft high, {{with equal}} spread. It blooms in spring with white flowers that turn to showy red fruit. It is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant for traditional and woodland shade gardens. [...] Subspecies italicum (the one normally grown in horticulture) has distinctive pale veins on the leaves, whilst subspecies neglectum has faint pale veins, {{and the leaves}} may have dark spots. [...] Some gardeners use this arum <b>to</b> <b>underplant</b> with Hosta, as they produce foliage sequentially: when the Hosta withers away, the arum replaces it in early winter, maintaining ground-cover. Numerous cultivars {{have been developed for}} garden use, of which A. italicum subsp. italicum 'Marmoratum' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
40|$|In a {{multilevel}} {{study to}} determine limits <b>to</b> <b>underplanted</b> conifer seedling growth, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedlings were planted beneath second-growth Douglas-fir stands that had been thinned to basal areas ranging from 16 to 31 m 2 /ha. Understory vegetation was treated with a broadcast herbicide application prior to thinning, a directed release herbicide application 2 years later, or no treatment beyond harvest disturbance. Residual overstory density was negatively correlated with percent survival for all four species. Broadcast herbicide application improved survival of grand fir and western hemlock. Western redcedar, grand fir, and western hemlock stem volumes {{were inversely related to}} overstory tree density, and this effect increased over time. There was a strong indication that this was also the case for Douglas-fir. Reduction of competing understory vegetation resulted in larger fourth-year stem volumes in grand fir and western hemlock...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was {{comparing}} growing of beech plants in different conditions under preparatory stands of alder and birch on LS LČR Šternberk district. There were 15 sites (8 under alder stand and 7 under birch stand) on which were made in different ways mining interventions in preparatory stands. There were measured overall 7 parametres (total height of seedlings, seedling height of last year, increment per the last year, length and width of the leaf, root collar diameter and deflection of stem from the vertical axis). Based on weight rating was find out, that each one of preparing stands has different impact <b>to</b> <b>underplanted</b> cultures. Under birch preparing stand was best conditions find out at site, where was density of stand reduced to 30 %. Under alder preparing stand was the best conditions find out under preparing stand with full density. The worst conditions for underplanted cultures were find out at sites without preparing stand (at clearcuts) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Understory conifer {{regeneration}} {{needs to}} occur beneath conifer-dominated canopies if two-storied or uneven-aged structures {{are to be}} considered for western Oregon Coast Range stand management. To ensure adequate numbers of seedlings to meet stocking or habitat structure objectives, planting may be a solution. We undertook a multi-level study to determine limits <b>to</b> <b>underplanted</b> conifer seedling growth. This experiment was installed in the McDonald-Dunn Research Forest. Plots were assigned four residual basal areas ranging from 16 to 31 m²/ha and split into three site preparation treatment subplots; broadcast herbicide application, release herbicide treatment and no site preparation. Subplots were planted with Douglas-fir, grand fir, western red cedar, and western hemlock. Seedling survival, absolute volume and relative growth rate were negatively correlated with overstory density. Broadcast herbicide application was beneficial to grand fir and western hemlock seedling growth. Release spraying did not have a beneficial effect on seedling volume growth. Soil moisture depletion was greatest near the soil surface. Individual vegetation variables were only weakly correlated with soil moisture depletion. Overstory tree density had the best overall prediction value for soil water depletion but was still weak. Western redcedar moisture stress increased with increasing overstory density and neighboring vegetation. Douglas-fir seedlings exhibited water stress throughout the season under all treatments. Early in the summer some Douglas-fir seedlings had pre-dawn xylem potentials that indicated they were not fully recovering from diurnal water stress. Grand fir xylem potentials decreased in unsprayed subplots. Western hemlock xylem potentials decreased steadily and were within the range that indicated stomatal closure by late July. Understory vegetation did not significantly affect western hemlock water relations. Black-tailed deer browsed 46...|$|R

40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{management}} of Quercus rubra is the the difficulty in regenerating stands that have developed dense understories of shade tolerant species. A study was conducted at two locations in south central Iowa to determine the impact over a five year period of using root graded seedlings, understory control, tree shelters, and overstory reduction on establishing underplanted, 1 - 0, Quercus rubra bare root stock. Relationships between growth or mortality, and photosynthetically active radiation, red to far red light ratio, basal area, average stand diameter, number of trees/hectare, percent stocking, and various combinations of these variables were tested. Shelters and root grading had the greatest impact on survival and growth of the underplanted seedlings. Annual survival and growth of non-sheltered seedlings was greater than sheltered seedlings after three growing seasons. However, By the end of the fifth growing season non-sheltered seedlings had averaged 221 percent greater growth and 75 percent greater survival than sheltered seedlings. Underplanted seedlings with five or more permanent, first-order, lateral roots had 93 percent greater growth at the McNay site and 407 percent at the Stephens sites, respectively, compared to seedlings with fewer, first-order lateral roots. R-square relationships between growth or mortality, and photosynthetically active radiation, red to far red light ratio, basal area, average stand diameter, number of trees/hectare, percent stocking, and various combinations ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 66. Spraying and mechanical clearing of the understory prior <b>to</b> <b>underplanting</b> helped underplanted seedlings maintaining a competitive position in the understory. Based on the literature and {{the results of this study}} resource managers should: (i) reduce overstory stocking to approximately 60 percent; (ii) use herbicide or mechanical methods to reduce understory competition; (iii) plant bare root stock with five or more permanent, first-order, lateral roots; and (iv) remove the remaining overstory when the underplanted Quercus rubra seedlings are 1. 5 m in height in order to aid in the regeneration of Quercus rubra in south central Iowa...|$|R
