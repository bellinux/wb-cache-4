5|$|The mining washed {{hundreds}} of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> {{of earth and}} sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries, devastated the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most mining operations had ended, and it was closed in 1918. Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> {{of toxic}} debris {{containing}} more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan {{due to the}} collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)).

5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E
