5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty, believing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> {{of debate}} and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered {{what they believe}} is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between attested Proto-Norse and unattested Proto-Germanic are rather small. Separating Proto-Norse from Northwest Germanic {{can be said}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of convention, as sufficient evidence from the remaining parts of the Germanic-speaking area (Northern Germany and the Netherlands) is lacking in a degree to provide sufficient comparison. Inscriptions found in Scandinavia {{are considered to be}} in Proto-Norse. Several scholars argue about this subject matter. Wolfgang von Krause sees the language of the runic inscriptions of the Proto-Norse period as an immediate precursor to Old Norse, but Elmer Antonsen views them as Northwest Germanic, but his views on Runic Script and related subjects might be considered extreme.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} of salat, since salat is {{commanded}} in the Qur'an, all Muslims agree that salat is an obligatory part of Islamic religious practice. According to hadithists, {{the details of how}} to correctly perform salat, to validly fulfill the Qur'anic commmand of salat, can only be found in the ahadith. Despite this, salat is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects, depending on which hadith collection each sect relies upon. Quranists, for their part, leave the detail of salat <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> between each individual Muslim and Allah, with salat performance done to each Muslim's own individual understanding, interpretation and need. In the Quranists' view, correctly performed salat lies not in any supposed correct details of the prayers' performance, but on a correct intention to perform the prayers, valid however it may be individually performed.|$|E

25|$|Christian theologians {{agree that}} the New Testament has a single and {{consistent}} theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, whilst others are contradictory, even within the same book. Despite {{the lack of a}} single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) monotheism, the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming Messiah, and the concepts of sin, faithfulness, and redemption. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches (see Christianity and Judaism). For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish expectation is different from the Christian view. Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God (trinitarianism and nontrinitarianism), nature of Jesus, views of the old covenant, original sin, predestination, ordination of women, hell, biblical prophecies, etc. have continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of dispute among theologians and various denominations.|$|E
