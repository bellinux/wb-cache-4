5000|$|In today’s {{administrative}} discretion, {{some issues}} {{affect the way}} organizations function {{and the way the}} public feels towards administrations/agencies as a whole. In this way public administrators are seen as [...] "moral agents"; they are given the task to exercise discretion, and reflect the society’s values. In theory, the public expects administrators to be the exemplary role models of society and follow laws and regulations. In reality, some do not think the administrators play fair and the public feels distrusts towards them. In a poll done by Gallup.com, the public showed an increase in the mistrust in government. People were asked if corruption was widespread throughout the government. The results recorded from 2006 to 2013 rose significantly; from 56% to 79%. The public may know little to nothing about the administration or their responsibilities, yet approval is very low. Some attribute this mistrust to a lack of transparency, where corruption can occur. The lack of transparency can mean that an administration is not completely honest, secretly keeping hidden agendas: withholding information from public view. It can also simply mean that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not attempt to make their information easy to access or understand for the public.|$|E

The quantitative analysis shows that Swiss parliamentarians demand more evaluations if they have the impression that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not implement the policies within their meaning.

40|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the transfer of sovereignty from British to Chinese rule, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has consistently tried to maintain {{a reputation as a}} jurisdiction that enjoys an independent judiciary and the rule of law. However, over the past decade, a series of events in particular areas have challenged this perception. The status of refugees and how they are treated represents one such area. The status of asylum seekers has always been a matter of concern as Hong Kong has never been a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Additionally, recent court decisions regarding the question of non-refoulement and the absence of a government screening process for refugees make it increasingly difficult for observers to accept Hong Kong as a forward-looking, world-class city. This article examines recent decisions that deal with Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s obligations under international law regarding avoiding the ejection of refugees to jurisdictions where they will likely face persecution or torture. In particular, this article focuses on C. and Others v. Director of Immigration, in which Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of First Instance considered whether an obligation of non-refoulement exists, and whether Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s government has a duty to provide a screening process to determine the status of all refugee claimants. Also explored is an earlier decision by Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of Final Appeal, Secretary for Security v. Prabakar, in which a screening procedure for torture claimants was established. In light of these decisions, this article outlines the current procedures used to determine refugee status and highlights the difficulties faced by refugees while awaiting resettlement in a third country. This article argues that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> in fact have a legal obligation under both international and Hong Kong law to provide asylum seekers a fair and transparent means of refugee status determination...|$|E
40|$|Paediatric {{health care}} is {{becoming}} increasingly high-specialised {{and there is a}} need to employ, nurses with specialist knowledge in the field. A large turnover of personnel and shortage of specially training in paediatric nursing have led to the need for employment of newly graduated nurses. How to best support these nurses to be those competent nurses that is needed have therefore been discussed. Aim: The overall aim of the study was to describe and analyse how nurses employed in paediatric care, describe the nurse profession, evaluate their professional level and attitude towards to research utilization. Study I: 18, newly graduated and newly employed nurses have described what they included in the concepts of responsibility, management of daily and rapidly changing situations and reflection. The results, analysed with qualitative content analysis, showed that nurses seemed to be fully aware of their responsibility regarding patients' well-being. The moral responsibilities, i. e. to function as the patient's "advocate" and protect patient's personal integrity, was also evident. The nurses emphasized the need for time and space for reflection, but also time to acquire the necessary knowledge for providing optimal nursing. Study II: 56 newly graduated nurses, and newly employed at two children's hospitals, have responded to the two questionnaires; Professional Self Description Form (PSDF), where nurses evaluate themselves regarding empathy, flexibility, ability to act etc (21 items in total), and Barriers Scale, a questionnaire concerning perceived barriers to research utilization (29 items in total). In the PSDF the nurses rated themselves highest in items of In the newly graduated nurses' scorings at the time for their employment, the highest scores were found in consideration (mean 4. 05), ambition (mean 3. 91) and sensitivity (mean 3. 84). The lowest scores were found in grasp of ideas (mean 2. 69), leadership (mean 2. 73) and discrimination (mean 2. 89), Regarding Barriers Scale the nurses perceived the highest barriers in using research results in the health care mostly related to the organisation itself (Study II). Study III: is a comparison two years after graduation between 36 nurses who received "traditional" introductory training and had worked for two years at a children's hospital (Controls), and 42 nurses who went through a one year trainee programme (Trainee). These were also compared to 35 paediatric nurses with specialist education. (Specialists). They responded to the same questionnaire as in study II. The control nurses rated themselves higher in the PSDF description of persistence (p< 0. 024). No other differences were found. In the Barriers Scale the specialists scored higher barriers in the affirmations pertaining to themselves as nurses, especially in that nurse is unwilling to test new ideas, that there are not enough experienced colleagues with whom to discuss research results, and that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not allow implementation of research results. In conclusion Self-evaluation of professional self and barriers to research utilisation are quite similar and independent of professional experience and knowledge.

40|$|Paediatric {{health care}} is {{becoming}} highly specialized {{and there is a}} need of nurses with specialist knowledge in the field. A large turnover of personnel and shortage of specially trained paediatric nurses have resulted in employing newly graduated and inexperienced nurses which further contributes to a decrease in professional competence. Development of professional competence is thus a process that has to be present at all times and must be evaluated continuously. The aim of this thesis was to identify how competence levels can be shown by describing and analyzing how nurses employed in paediatric care describe their nursing role and how they evaluate their professional level and attitudes to research utilization. Furthermore, we wanted to analyze qualitative differences between nurses with diverse formal education and experiences. Study I: When eighteen newly graduated and newly employed nurses described what they included in the concepts of responsibility, management of daily and rapidly changing situations and reflection, the results, analysed with qualitative content analysis, showed that nurses seemed to be fully aware of their responsibility regarding patients well-being. The moral responsibilities, i. e. to act as the patient s advocate and protect patient s personal integrity, was also evident. The nurses emphasized the need of time and space for reflection, but also time to acquire the necessary knowledge for providing optimal nursing. Study II: Fifty-six newly graduated and newly employed nurses at two children s hospitals responded in written form to the two questionnaires; Professional Self Description Form (PSDF) 21 items in total including empathy, flexibility, ability to act etc.), and Barriers Scale 29 items in total concerning perceived barriers to research utilization). The results showed that in PSDF the nurses scored highest in compassion, ambition and sensitivity. The lowest scores were found in preparedness to act and problem-solving ability, leadership and discriminating capacity. In the Barriers Scale the nurses perceived the lowest barriers in the affirmations pertaining to themselves as nurses and the highest barriers within the areas concerning the organization. Study III: We have compared newly graduated nurses who had received traditional introductory training and had worked for two years at a children s hospital (Controls, n= 36) with nurses going through a one year trainee programme (Trainees, n= 42) and with paediatric nurses with specialist education (Specialists, n= 35), using the same questionnaire as in study II. The results showed that the control nurses rated themselves higher in the PSDF description of persistence compared to the other two groups. No other differences were found. In the Barriers Scale the specialists scored higher barrier in the affirmations pertaining to themselves as nurses, especially in that the nurse is unwilling to test new ideas, that there are not enough experienced colleagues with whom to discuss research results, and that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not allow implementation of research results. Study IV: When comparing nurses with diverse formal education and experiences concerning qualitative differences when reasoning about a paediatric case the results showed some disparities. The study was based on six recorded group discussions of a fictive but realistic paediatric case and was analysed by a qualitative latent content analysis. Out of the themes found: child s social situation, child abuse and the child s illness, qualitative differences emerged in how the nurses discussed the case. Three separate approaches were identified: a task-oriented, an action-oriented and a hypothesis-oriented, the latter being evident in the two groups comprised of nurses with specialist education. Between the two other groups, novice and experienced nurses, no differences were shown in how they discussed the case. In conclusion: Newly graduated nurses are aware of their responsibility as nurses in general. Self-evaluation of professional self and barriers to research utilization are quite similar and independent of professional experience and knowledge. Nurses with long experience and specialist education have a different approach in how they discuss a fictive but realistic case compared to nurses with lower educational level. Thus, the importance of experience per se for the development of competence is still an open question. Working experience in combination with further, specialist education seems to be of importance in the development of professional competence in paediatric care...|$|E
