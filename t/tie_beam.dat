In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at Ely and Peterborough cathedrals in England.

25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> support {{added in the}} 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E
500|$|The {{eastern end}} of Bristol Cathedral is highly unusual {{for a number of}} reasons. Firstly, it was {{conceived}} as a [...] "hall church", meaning that the aisles are the same height as the choir. While a feature of German Gothic architecture, this is rare in Britain, and Bristol cathedral is the most significant example. In the 19th century, G. E. Street designed the nave along the same lines. The effect of this elevation means that there are no clerestory windows to light the central space, as is usual in English Medieval churches. The north and south aisles employ a unique manner where the vaults rest on <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> style bridges supported by pointed arches. All the internal light must come from the aisle windows which are accordingly very large. In the choir, the very large window of the Lady chapel is made to fill the entire upper part of the wall, so that it bathes the vault in daylight, particularly in the morning.|$|E

The slabs are generally [...] wide and [...] high with a [...] vertical overlap (shiplap) to prevent water from entering the horizontal joints. Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is [...] [...] Its weight is [...] The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24' from the vertical. [...] There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the [...] level, all being integrated into the walls up to the [...] level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble <b>tie</b> <b>beam.</b> The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The {{academic}} {{name for}} this type of house comes from the German words [...] "Fach" [...] (bay), describing the space (up to [...] ) between trusses made of two rafters fixed to a <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> and connected to two posts with braces and [...] "Halle", meaning something like hall as in a hall house. The walls were usually timber-framed, made of posts and rails; the panels (Gefache) in between are filled with wattle and daub or bricks. One bay may be two or rarely three Gefache wide.|$|E
2500|$|The nave {{north and}} south arcades leading to the {{north and south}} aisles are of three bays each, and date to the 13th century. The arcade pointed arches, of double-faceted flat and rounded mouldings, sit on piers {{incorporating}} four rounded columns each with a central raised flat projection continuous along the full length. Between each rounded column is a continuous annulet (flat hollow). The piers' capitals and abaci are flat-faced Doric of five sides; the deep base octagonal and moulded. A continuous hood mould runs above the arches throughout each arcade. The 15th-century nave roof is of <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> construction; it was restored in the 19th century when stone corbels and cross braces were replaced. Within the nave, beneath the tower arch, is a 14th-century octagonal font (PastScape: 15th-century). The stone plinth and bowl is panelled on each side: the plinth with plain recessed fields, each alternate with carved twin flower-head reliefs; the bowl with panels of carved quatrefoils with inset shields, [...] alternating with blind tracery. A font cover is of plain wood, with eight raised pink open scrolls attached meeting an octagonal shaft topped by a gold-painted urn.|$|E

2500|$|Development of the New England barn began {{early in}} the 19th century, but they usually date from after 1830. They were the most popular barn type in New England by 1860. The {{construction}} {{is very different from}} the English barn [...] typically being built using the square rule method of joinery, raised in bents, [...] increasingly of sawn rather than hewn timbers, common rafter roof framing with purlin plates, designed to be used with a , straight posts rather than flared (gunstock) posts, and dropped <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> framing rather than the English tying joint. The doors are mounted on the gable end rather than the sidewall and after the 1840s mounted on rollers so they slide sideways rather than being mounted on hinges and swinging outward. Sometimes they have interior sliding doors. Doors on rollers are believed to have been a development from rail cars which had sliding doors. A full basement became standard and was used primarily for manure management with trap doors in the floor of the tie-up so manure was easily shoveled into the basement for later use on the fields. This is a significant difference between the Pennsylvania Barn where the cows were housed on the basement level. The basements also had sliding doors, sometimes arranged as a drive through passage. The foundation is dry laid stone, some of which may have been split rather than just being field-stone; and some barns have a top course of large, rectangular, quarried stones. The drive floor was not needed for hand threshing since threshing machines were available by this time. Scarf joints were needed to join timbers longitudinally because these barns are larger in size and the timber supply was more limited so full length timbers were not available. Roof overhangs of a foot are typically built in on the gables and eaves protecting the walls from water. Later in the 19th century these barns may also have ventilators or a cupola on the roof to help reduce moisture build-up inside. Stairways are sometimes found in New England barns but built-in ladders are common but less prevalent than ladders found in the New World Dutch barn. The number and size of cows were larger and were given more headroom so the New England barns were not just longer and wider but taller. Also the New England barn was popular during the period in northern New England when the connected farm building arrangement was popular and so were more likely to be connected to the house through a series of smaller rooms. Some New England barns have an indoor silo. These barns are easier to add on to by adding more bays. The New England barn almost always has a gable roof, but a gambrel roof form may be found on some New England barns. Sometimes the New England barn is framed with studs in the walls and horizontal sheathing boards instead of the more common rails with vertical sheathing.|$|E

There is one main transverse oak <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> on which the king post of the main truss is based. The king post is in tension to prevent sagging of the horizontal <b>tie</b> <b>beam,</b> so neither the king post nor the <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> are resting on the mill below.
