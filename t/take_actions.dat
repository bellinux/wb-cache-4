5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E

25|$|The Giuliani {{administration}} {{advocated the}} privatization of failing public schools and increasing school choice through a voucher-based system. Giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants. He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service about immigration violations, {{on the grounds that}} illegal aliens should be able to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation.|$|E
25|$|The Bisbee Deportations {{were later}} {{used by some}} proponents as an {{argument}} in favor of stronger laws against unpopular speech. Such laws would be justified as empowering the government to suppress disloyal speech and activity, and remove the need for citizens groups to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> the government could not.

The House of Lords ruled that contract {{could not be used}} to lessen the rights of end user purchasers, at least purchasers of consumer products such as motor cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{current crisis}} has {{its origins in}} the Fiji coup of 2000. The 2000 coup was aimed at the {{multi-ethnic}} Government led by Mahendra Chaudhry. The proponents of the coup were an armed faction not {{closely associated with the}} military, who opposed their actions. After Bainimarama declared martial law and resolved the crisis by force, an interim government was sworn in, headed by current prime minister Laisenia Qarase. The Prime Minister was democratically elected in elections in 2001 and 2006, and has since begun to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> that have provoked the displeasure of the military.|$|E

The Governor-General Silva Tavares took measures to calm down the situation and on 2 May 1961, the Government decreed the change of the labor legislation related with cotton culture. Apparently, these measures were successful in deeply reducing the discontent among the laborers of the Baixa de Cassanje, with the region remaining peaceful even after the UPA attacks of 15 March 1961.|$|E
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln {{was inaugurated}} as president.

A crisis {{similar to the one}} at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortificationFort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, and how. They were also concerned about whether to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result.

40|$|We {{examined}} factors underlying people's {{willingness to}} <b>take</b> <b>action</b> {{in favor of}} or against nuclear energy from a moral perspective. We conducted a questionnaire study among {{a sample of the}} Dutch population (N = 123). As expected, perceptions of risks and benefits were related to personal norms (PN), that is, feelings of moral obligation toward taking action in favor of or against nuclear energy. In turn, PN predicted willingness to <b>take</b> <b>action.</b> Furthermore, PN mediated the relationships between perceptions of risk and benefits and willingness to <b>take</b> <b>action.</b> In line with our hypothesis, beliefs about the risks and benefits of nuclear energy were less powerful in explaining PN for supporters compared to PN of opponents. Also, beliefs on risks and benefits and PN explained significantly more variance in willingness to <b>take</b> <b>action</b> of opponents than of supporters. Our results suggest that a moral framework is useful to explain willingness to <b>take</b> <b>action</b> in favor of and against nuclear energy, and that {{people are more likely to}} protest in favor of or against nuclear energy when PN are strong...|$|R

25|$|As of late 1950s, Syrian non-military {{internal}} security forces totalled about 5,000 personnel, including a National GendarmÃ©rie of 2,800, a Desert Patrol of 400 and 1,800 uniformed police, {{under the authority}} of the Ministry of Interior. Both the gendarmÃ©rie and police were deployed in strategically important posts throughout the country. One desert patrol company was located in Central Syria and the other in Eastern Syria. The standard of training was deemed as being very low. In addition to the uniformed police, the police services included the SÃ»retÃ©, a plain-clothes service of about 300 men. At the time, the United States Department of State deemed the non-military security forces to be unable to restrict the Communist action; nevertheless, due to the strength of political forces deemed as leftist (Communist and Ba'ath parties), the U.S. Department of State adopted a policy of avoiding to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> aimed strengthen Syrian {{internal security}} forces.|$|E
25|$|The duty of {{good faith}} {{requires}} control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisionsâ€”that is, the care that a {{reasonably prudent person}} in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting {{in the best interest}} of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (e.g., a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).|$|E

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thingâ€”and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thingâ€”will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to <b>take</b> <b>actions</b> on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E
