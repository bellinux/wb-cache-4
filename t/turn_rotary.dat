40|$|Component {{testing is}} one of the most {{important}} tasks before it is put to use in any application. In this direction linearity of potentiometer plays an important role, especially the multi <b>turn</b> <b>rotary</b> potentiometers. This is because; such potentiometers are used in vital applications such as in aircrafts for the maintenance of certain pressure systems and as rotary position sensors. Testing for linearity is an important task in such a scenario. Testing of components calls for an analog to digital converter for converting analog information into digital domain. The main aim of the present work is to design and develop an embedded system to test the linearity of such a potentiometer. Such a system is portable. The hardware makes use of a stepper motor, a Darlington driver IC ULN 2003 and a small jig to attach the potentiometer to a stepping motor. Philips ARM LPC 2103 -mixed signal controller controls the entire assembly. Software is developed to acquire data from potentiometer, to store the data on the on-chip memory, to display it on LCD, and to send the same to PC on serial lines using MAX- 232. The linearity plot is displayed on the system monitor. ...|$|E
40|$|The horse-whim {{was first}} used to <b>turn</b> <b>rotary</b> mills in Greece in 300 B. C. Roman {{engineers}} developed capstan machinery to propel boats with paddle wheels about 370 A. D. About 1680, Rupert, a cousin of King Charles II, built the first horseboat using a horse-whim mechanism to tow ships in the Royal Navy. People in America called the vessels “teamboats,” because of their close relationship to steamboats. By 1819, 8 - 12 horse-boats operated between Manhattan and points across the Hudson and East Rivers. Although teamboats were cheaper than steamboats, they had disadvantages: the circular walkways took {{up a lot of}} deck space and the horses had to walk in circles. In 1819, the treadwheel-propelled horseboat was invented which placed the turntable below the deck; horses stood on top of the turntable through slots in the deck and drove the wheel backward by walking in place. This eased the burden on the horses, freed up deck space, and allowed the ferry to be built on one hull. In the 1830 s, horse-powered treadmills were developed and used with attachments on the farm; they also revolutionized the design of horse ferries. In 1889, Zuntz and Lehmann reported on the chemistry of respiration in the horse during exercise using a revolving platform. Brody, in the 1930 s, used a treadmill to study energy metabolism of the horse and in the early 1960 s Persson was the first to use a high-speed treadmill to study the physiology of exercise in the horse...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand of}} aerospace, defence, medical and {{chemical}} industries to special alloys have been increasing recently in application requiring high performance. Ability {{to retain their}} high mechanical and chemical properties even at elevated temperatures makes superalloys such as ni-base, ti-base, co-base, ideal for use in these industries. Even though machining {{is one of the}} important production methods of these alloys, these alloys show formidable challenges to cutting tools. Due to their unique inherent properties, cutting tools expose to higher cutting temperatures and higher stresses during process resulting premature failure, hence these alloys are called difficult to machine alloys. As a result, machining of these alloys with conventional processes is unproductive, time consuming and costly. <b>Rotary</b> <b>turning</b> processes can be a good solution for machining these superalloys. Rotational motion of cutting insert around its axis during process provides fresh portion of cutting edge to cutting region continuously. As a result, generated heat is dissipated around cutting edge and heating of a particular portion of tool is prevented. This reduces the thermally activated wear mechanism on cutting edge resulting prolonged tool life and increasing machinability of these alloys. The main aim of this thesis is to understand the performance of self-propelled <b>rotary</b> <b>turning</b> (SPRT) and actively driven <b>rotary</b> <b>turning</b> (ADRT) tools on metals especially for difficult to cut alloys. Tool life, generated forces, surface roughness and circularity of workpiece are analyzed for various cutting and cooling conditions for <b>rotary</b> <b>turning</b> processes. The effects of tool inclination angle, tool velocity and cooling conditions on tool wear behavior are examined for ADRT process.

40|$|Machining of difficult-to-cut {{materials}} such as high-temperature metals is challenging due to their low machinability resulting in reduced productivity and high manufacturing cost. Turning is a common operation used for production of these parts where cutting speed, and thus the material removal rate, is limited due to high tool wear rate.

This paper presents experimental results on two nonconventional turning operations, namely turn-milling and <b>rotary</b> <b>turning</b> processes, applied on common difficult-to-cut materials. Tool wear was measured under various cutting conditions for both processes and compared with conventional turning. From test results, it can be concluded that both turn-milling and <b>rotary</b> <b>turning</b> operations can provide longer tool life compared to conventional turning, thanks to intermittent characteristics of processes which result in lower average tool temperature.

The experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether torque perception {{was determined by the}} spatial or by the temporal characteristics of the rotary switch. In Experiment I, manual detection thresholds of torque variation were measured with raised sinusoidal torque profiles that varied in spatial period from 2. 8 degree to 180 degree per cycle. In Experiment II, the same was measured for torque profiles that varied in temporal frequency from 2 to 300 Hz. Experiment III was similar to Experiment 1 except that the participants were required to <b>turn</b> the <b>rotary</b> switch at two different speeds for each of seven spatially specified torque profiles (spatial period: 2. 8 degree to 90 degree per cycle).

Whereas in single-point locking, {{the door on}} a cabinet locks only {{at the point where}} the key is turned, halfway up the edge of the door, three-point locking enables the top and bottom of the door to be simultaneously secured. This is accomplished by attaching two long steel rods to the lock on the inside of the door, which extend vertically upwards and downwards: when the lock is <b>turned,</b> the <b>rotary</b> movement of the latch on the inside of the door translates to vertical movement in these rods, with the result that the upper rod moves upwards by an inch or so, and the lower rod moves downwards similarly. This causes the ends of the rods to move through small holes in the flanges at the top and bottom of the door, resulting from the metal of the door being turned inwards, and the rods then move a short distance into holes in the metal surrounding the door. This effectively immobilizes the top and bottom of the door, and greatly increases the security of the door-locking compared to a door with only single-point locking.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{advances in}} the state-of-the-art in legged locomotion {{through the development of}} bounding and galloping gaits as well as new modes of hybrid wheeled-leg modes of locomotion. Two four-legged running robots, Scout II and PAW, are examined, the latter of which is distinguished by actuated wheels at the ends of its legs. First, hybrid modes of locomotion are demonstrated which use legs to dynamically reposition wheels at specific locations with respect to the body. These modes improve the stability and tire-wear of turning and braking manoeuvres and allow pitch-controlled slope ascent and descent in a wheeled-leg vehicle such as the PAW robot. Second, through hip actuation, passive leg compliance and controlled wheel action it is possible to make the same vehicle run using a dynamically stable legged gait called the bound. Experimental evidence of this is presented and compared to similar experiments on the same robot with mechanically blocked wheels, a 3 D simulation of the same, as well as bounding on a completely different quadrupedal robot, Scout II. While a casual observer finds no difference in blocked-wheel and active wheel control modes, detailed examination of the gaits reveals lower speeds and efficiency as well as decreased repeatability when the wheels are actively controlled. A new method of forward speed control is presented for the bounding gait using liftoff, as opposed to touchdown, leg angles. The liftoff angle method of speed control is shown to be particularly suited to fine-tuning of certain gait performance indices. Third, the underactuated bounding gait is extended to demonstrate, for the first time, that robotic galloping is possible and that it can be achieved in two underactuated quad-rupedal robots and with varying levels of decoupled control. In the Scout II robot the front leg pair and rear leg pairs function independently; while in the PAW robot galloping is achieved with no controlled coupling between any of the four legs. The rotary gallop gait demonstrated by both robots is characterized by a significant yaw component and is compared to another bound-derived turning gait which uses liftoff angles to produce yaw. In particular, the correspondence of lead leg to yaw direction in both cases is found to match results from biology. In contrast, while it is thought that animals pivot about their lead leg to <b>turn,</b> the <b>rotary</b> gallop demonstrated by these robots shows that yaw occurs primarily in the leg behind the lead leg...|$|R

Thus, it secures just 18 - 20 % of instances of processing of inbound unit trains within set standard time.
