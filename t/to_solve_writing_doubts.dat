Using a Gauss quadrature rule, the method requires only the evaluation of the potential at some mesh points.

It is shown that this method can be adapted <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> eigenequations <b>written</b> in momentum space, keeping the convenience and the accuracy of the original technique. In particular, the kinetic operator is a diagonal matrix. Observables in both configuration space and momentum space can also be easily computed with a good accuracy using only eigenfunctions computed in the momentum space. The method is tested with Gaussian and Yukawa potentials, requiring respectively a small or a great mesh to reach convergence. Comment: Extended versio...|$|R

40|$|Researchers in {{the field}} of {{composition}} studies have frequently made allusions to musicians when they’ve discussed the role of practice in gaining skill. In doing so, however, they’ve risked making speculative rather than testable claims and separating composition studies from recent insights on practice from other disciplines such as education and music psychology. These fields, I argue, offer testable frameworks with which composition instructors and scholars can teach and study writing practice. Such frameworks are necessary because composition researchers need to supplement qualitative studies of writers and writing with quantitative data to generate replicable tests of teaching methods that may benefit practicing writers. This thesis draws on prior research in composition studies to illustrate the context of its central argument. It then breaks down some of the key assertions about practice that support this context before introducing frameworks from other disciplines that will allow composition researchers to replicate studies of effective writing practice instruction in the first-year college writing classroom. These frameworks or models of practice instruction include self-regulated strategy development and practice sessions conceived as stages of error and mistake management. Supplementing these models are descriptions of a few key activities built on these frameworks for students to practice writing in and outside the classroom. Students need more than instruction in crafting better writing products to become more effective revisers and more expert writers. They also need explicit instruction that teaches them how to engage effectively in repeated, structured practice that imparts the tools they learn <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>writing</b> problems with staying power and flexibility. This instruction is about more than handy tips or exercises; it’s about changing students’ and teachers’ assumptions about writing’s purpose outside the classroom...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that clients learn new behaviors, skills, or attitudes from counseling. Indeed, counselors strive to teach clients concepts that enable problems to be approached in less self-defeating ways. Having acquired these new therapeutic concepts, clients would presumably be better capable of solving the problems which prompted their seeking help. Despite the acceptance of this basic formula for client change, virtually no research has investigated the parameters that govern the learning of concepts presented to a client by a counselor. This lack of research may stem from an absence of any clear theoretical account {{of the way that}} clients attend to, process, and remember important counselor statements. ^ Numerous studies of prose and sentence learning, however, suggest a framework for studying clients 2 ̆ 7 learning of and memory for counseling content. This study extended that research in verbal learning and memory to explain the factors governing clients 2 ̆ 7 memory for the contents of counseling. A theoretical framework was proposed and its relevance for counseling was tested. ^ In attempting to demonstrate the relevance of this verbal learning research, counseling interventions were designed to enhance clients 2 ̆ 7 memory for key counseling concepts provided during an interview.

50|$|In {{the process}} of working with MESM, {{it became clear that}} the more complex tasks were {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> by <b>writing</b> simple machine programs. There was a need to develop a high-level programming language, but there was a problem: the absence of an appropriate translator for better human/computer communication. L.I. Kaluzhnin, a professor at Kyiv University, who taught a course on mathematical logic in the 1950-70s, made a significant advancement in the understanding of this problem and formalized a scheme of interfacing with the program. Following this development, in 1955, Yushchenko developed the programming language, which was a language-based on two general principles for the computer work: addressing and software management. Creating a convenient system of concepts for describing the computer architecture and its system instructions, the language thus became the means of manipulation of the second-rank addresses. Yushchenko’s contribution became the first fundamental achievement of the Soviet School of Theoretical Programming, and was well ahead of the creation of the first programming language Fortran (1958), Cobol (1959) and Algol (1960).|$|R

As anyone who has written such code knows, there are many traps awaiting. This increases the need for good concurrency-aware tools {{to be used in the}} program quality cycle: monitoring, testing, debugging, and the emerging field of self-healing. Academics who build such tools face two main difficulties; writing the instrumentation infrastructure for the tool, and integrating it into real user environments to obtain meaningful results. As these difficulties are hard to overcome, most academic tools do not make it past the toy stage. The ConTest Listener architecture provides instrumentation and runtime engines to which writers of test and heal tools, especially concurrency-oriented, can easily plug their code. This paper describes this architecture, mainly from the point of view of a user intending to create a testing/healing tool. This architecture enables tool creators to focus on the concurrent problem they are trying <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> without <b>writing</b> the entire infrastructure.

Difficulties securing timely and quality discharge information and unclear role boundaries can be challenging. There are limited {{reports in the}} literature describing community-based practitioners 2 ̆ 7 roles communicating client information. Aim: To describe the roles of community-based practitioners in communication of older clients 2 ̆ 7 information in an Australian context. Design: A descriptive and exploratory qualitative research design was applied. Methods: Four focus groups were conducted in 2009 with a small sample (n = 16) of district nurses, practice nurses and aged care case managers. Results: All participants described communication as a core characteristic of their role focused on minimising risks for older people. Participants valued dialogue with other health and social care providers in real time {{with an emphasis on}} telephone communication, face-to-face meetings, and case conferences. Telephone communication was considered important where there was an urgent need <b>to</b> problem <b>solve.</b> <b>Written</b> communication was noted as less effective. Conclusions: There is an increasing need for stronger models of communication in community-based settings to facilitate safe, efficient and sustainable health and social outcomes for older people. Implications for practice: There is limited available research with this focus to guide practice. Findings from this exploratory study indicate a number of important areas for further research: (i) to understand how communication feedback systems and pathways between community and inpatient providers could improve information exchange and (ii) to describe community nurses 2 ̆ 7 roles in communication and medication risks for older people. </span...|$|R

A strategy was classified as effective if it resulted in the correct solution at least 75 % of the time. For mental addition and subtraction, primitive strategies such as counting on fingers and counting on (mental counting from a specific point), and the more sophisticated strategy 1010 (solution of the calculation problem using tens and units separately) were {{more effective than the}} strategies learned at school. In written addition, subtraction and multipli-cation there was a shift from the CAR to the CAR- strategy (tabulating with, or without, a carried amount) from the third to the later grades. Results show that typical strategies taught at school progressively substitute every other strategy both in mental and written calculation, but without reaching the criterion of effectiveness. The implications for maths curricula are discussed.
