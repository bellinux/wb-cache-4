5|$|Ten years later, in 123 BC, Gaius <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{office as}} his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians.

5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology never <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> hold of {{the visual}} arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E

5|$|In Maui County, the Hawai'i Department of Education ordered for {{the closure}} of all schools and the {{designation}} of some facilities as emergency shelters. All public schools in Hawaii County were also closed by the department. Both the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Community College closed their campuses during Iselle's passage. The Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources closed all of its managed lands in Hawaii and Maui counties and closed some of its campgrounds and wilderness areas in Oahu and Kauai counties. All state offices and courthouses in Hawaii County were closed with the retention of only essential staff. Although Hawaiian Airlines did not cancel its flights, the company waived fees for passengers seeking to change from flights expected to service during Iselle's passage. United Airlines and Island Air later <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> accommodative measures.

5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{again in}} Spring 1992, the CSU and UC systems were facing {{another round of}} severe budget cuts and {{dramatic}} student fee increases by the state government. Still a second time, SDSU President Thomas Day <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> deep and narrow approach for budget cuts for SDSU, but this time proposed elimination of not only full time faculty professors, but of entire majors such as Aerospace Engineering. In and attempt to alleviate fears of students in those majors, a large meeting by President Day was planned in the student center with hundreds of students and teachers. However, meeting quickly turned angry and chaotic with an overcapacity crowd pressing against the glass windows outside. Following the meeting, students feeling betrayed a 2nd time after 1991, about a dozen students held a temporary occupation of President Day's office. This occupation led to a 24 hour vigil {{in front of the}} Administration building, summer student bus trips to the state legislature in Sacramento, large campus student voter registration drive, and further student marches and protests in the Fall 1992. Under heavy student, teacher, and public pressure, the conclusion of these events ended with CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz eventually reversing President Day's deep and narrow approach, saving the majors and programs in Fall 1992.|$|E

5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{amount of time to}} swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him {{to the attention of the}} scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E
