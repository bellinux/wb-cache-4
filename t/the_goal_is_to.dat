5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike {{games are}} focused on hack and slash-based gameplay, where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> kill lots of monsters, and where other {{peaceful}} options do not exist.|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{organization}} {{refers to}} the way pictures, words, phrases, and sentences are displayed on the communication system. In general, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> facilitate efficient and effective communication, especially when the individual's AAC system contains {{a large number of}} symbols.|$|E

5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing a petri dish. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells {{smaller than the}} player's cell, while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cell(s). The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero Live is a {{music video}} game {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames {{and published by}} Activision. It was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in October 2015 and to iOS devices including Apple TV in November 2015. As with previous games in the series, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a special guitar controller to match fret patterns displayed on a scrolling note pattern on screen {{in time with the}} music.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, {{and to make the}} vehicle difficult to identify even if it is spotted.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} and compare disease free survival (dfs) and recurrence rate in both groups.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reach CL$ 138,728,450, {{which again}} was surpassed {{with a total}} of CL$ 176,420,628.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get a {{more quickly}} {{reconfigurable}} architecture, i.e., several conversations at once, in an open software architecture, with cross-channel connectivity (the radio can [...] "bridge" [...] different radio protocols). <b>The</b> secondary <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> make it smaller, cheaper, and weigh less.|$|R
5|$|Therefore, Apollonius' {{problem can}} be re-stated in Lie {{geometry}} as a problem of finding perpendicular vectors on the Lie quadric; specifically, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify solution vectors Xsol that belong to the Lie quadric and are also orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vectors X1, X2 and X3 corresponding to the given circles.|$|E
5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Computer Space is a space combat arcade game {{developed}} in 1971 {{as one of}} the last games created in the early history of video games. Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.|$|E
50|$|For the World TB Day 2011 campaign, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> inspire {{innovation}} in TB research and care.|$|R

5000|$|The Pale Wrestling from {{an upright}} position. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> throw <b>the</b> {{opponent}} {{on the ground}} three times.|$|R
5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinimaâ€”the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E
5|$|On the {{edition of}} SmackDown! {{following}} The Great American Bash, Eddie Guerrero revealed the secret {{he had been}} keeping; he was Dominick's real father, not Rey Mysterio (was thought to be). At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match, where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> climb a ladder to retrieve an object that is suspended in the air. As per pre-match stipulations, Mysterio gained complete custody of Dominick. On the September 9 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match to end the feud. Guerrero then began a feud with Batista when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy. Guerrero, however, died unexpectedly of heart failure on November 13, 2005. In 2006 Guerrero {{was inducted into the}} WWE Hall of Fame by Mysterio, his nephew Chavo Guerrero, and Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, who come in waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E
30|$|Initial resolution. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{maximize}} <b>the</b> {{overlap between}} the crystallographic data {{set and the}} EM model (Navaza 2008).|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> {{validity}} and clinically important {{differences on the}} PROMIS-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> two {{approaches}} <b>to</b> statistical inference: model-based inference and design-based inference. [...] Both approaches rely on some statistical model {{to represent the}} data-generating process. In the model-based approach, the model <b>is</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> initially unknown, and one of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> select an appropriate model for inference. In the design-based approach, the model <b>is</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known, and one of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that <b>the</b> sample data are selected randomly enough for inference.|$|R
5|$|The Adenhart family {{created the}} Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund, which is {{designed}} to provide financial support to youth baseball organizations. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> lend a helping hand to struggling leagues around the country to buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in Halfway, Maryland. Two annual events, the Nick Adenhart 5K Run and Walk and the Nick Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the park's value and available money {{so that it}} can be sold and a new lot purchased from another part of the world to start a new theme park. Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Lemmings {{also has}} 20 two-player levels. This {{took advantage of}} the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.|$|E
50|$|In {{the digital}} {{currency}} riecoin one of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find prime sextuplets for large prime numbers p using distributed computing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find factors {{associated}} with major political conflicts. Over 400 cases were analyzed, both for global and regional data sets.|$|R
5000|$|Another show, The U.S. of Archie, {{depicted}} Archie and {{the gang}} as themselves in different historical eras. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> teach history.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500â€“1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E
5|$|Important {{polynomial}} time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting (finding a topological ordering), {{construction of the}} transitive closure and transitive reduction (the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively), and the closure problem, in which <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find a minimum-weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them {{to the rest of}} the graph. Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible (the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem, respectively) is NP-hard, but any directed graph can be made into a DAG (its condensation) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP-hard.|$|E
5000|$|LivingKnowledge (Project No. 231126) {{ran from}} February 2009 through January 2012. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> improve {{navigation}} and search in large multimodal datasets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> put to {{satellites}} in to orbit: Vanguard 3b satellite, a magnetometer {{to map the}} earth's {{magnetic field}} and 30 in round inflatable sphere for optical tracking. Vanguard SLV-5 only reached an altitude of 140 km, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> 3840 km <b>to</b> orbit.|$|R
