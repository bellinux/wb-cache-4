5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E

25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, the Chargers finally caught a break when a short Miami punt and {{facemask}} penalty during the return {{gave them the}} ball at the Dolphins 28, where Fouts threw a touchdown pass to Charlie Joiner. But the team's miscues continued as Rolf Benirschke missed the extra point. Then on Miami's ensuing drive, Jimmy Cefalo's 53-yard reception led to von Schamann's 23-yard field goal.

UNC would repeat their earlier tandem with Dailey {{throwing}} a 72-yd pass to Nicks <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to 38-26. But that would be UNC's last hurrah in this game as the Irish defense would prevent anymore scoring and the lone score of the 4th quarter was Darius Walker's 1-yd run to give 45-26 final.|$|E

Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to two points, {{it looked as if}} they might have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E

25|$|On Selection Sunday, Gonzaga {{received}} a one {{seed in the}} 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament {{for the first time}} in school history and was set to play Southern on March 21 at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah.

As the next two plays fell short of a first down, Miami settled for a field goal from the Patriots' 14 yard-line, but Fuad Reveiz' kick sailed wide to the right after a badly taken snap.|$|E
