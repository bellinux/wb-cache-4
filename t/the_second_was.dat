5|$|The {{question}} of Elagabalus' sexual orientation is confused, owing to salacious and unreliable sources. Elagabalus married and divorced five women, three {{of whom are}} known.

5|$|A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 {{showed that}} 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives.

Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent.|$|E

5|$|A quintuple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—-in a single game. There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both only done at the high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E

Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
