25|$|Only 7.5% <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> to work, using Adelaide Metro buses, {{the only}} public {{transport}} in the suburb. Normal routes into the CBD are by the 142 or 147 which both run into {{or close to}} the suburb. The 820/821 bus travels from the Adelaide Hills into the CBD along Greenhill Road. Buses typically run on 30-minute intervals during weekdays and one-hour intervals at other times. Unfortunately, due to the heavy emphasis on car transport in the area, the bus routes are limited and under-developed, particularly compared to the efficient public transit links {{to the rest of}} metropolitan Adelaide.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

2500|$|In fall 2017, the MTA {{will launch}} a pilot {{that will allow}} LIRR, bus and subway service to use one ticket. The {{proposal}} for the ticket, called the [...] "Freedom Ticket," [...] was initially put forth by the NYCTRC in 2007. The NYCTRC wrote a proof of concept report in 2015. At {{the time of the}} report, express bus riders from Southeast Queens had some of the longest commutes in the city, with their commutes being 96 minutes long, yet they paid a premium fare of $6.50. Riders who take the dollar van to the subway paid $4.75 to get to Manhattan in 65 minutes; riders who only <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and subway paid $2.75 to get to Manhattan in 86 minutes; and riders who took the LIRR paid $10 to get to Manhattan in 35 minutes. Unlike the CityTicket, the Freedom Ticket would be valid for off-peak and multidirectional travel; have free transfers to the subway and bus system; and be capped at $215 per month. At the time, monthly CityTickets cost $330 per month.|$|E
