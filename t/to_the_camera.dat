5|$|In {{some cases}} missing episodes are bridged by {{narration}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> – often by a surviving actor from the serial, occasionally in-character. For their VHS releases, The Reign of Terror and The Crusade were presented by actors Carole Ann Ford and William Russell – while Episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion were bridged by Nicholas Courtney.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) overhears Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confessing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that he {{is having}} an affair with Angela's (Angela Kinsey) husband Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman). Oscar makes Kevin promise not to reveal anything. During the day, Angela {{constantly}} makes unconscious double entendres and foreshadowing, sorely tempting Kevin to let out what he knows. Afraid that Kevin cannot keep his secret, Oscar tries to frame Kevin so that Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) will have him fired, but confesses to Toby that he lied. Later, Robert visits the office, and Oscar acts unnaturally nervous around him. Before Angela's suspicions can be aroused, Kevin interrupts to cheer Robert on about his upcoming election. Oscar says <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{that he is}} proud of how Kevin kept the secret, but Kevin then reveals that he momentarily forgot all about the secret, and begins to laugh uncontrollably.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} follows no storyline. Each group member wears three {{different}} outfits throughout, {{all of which}} portray their individual styles. The video is introduced with a screen split into four in which each member is shown singing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> They then dance separately in front of different, brightly-coloured backdrops which manifest their individual personalities: a flower and gramophone record backdrop (Edwards), a bow tie backdrop (Thirlwall), graffiti-decorated (Pinnock), and boomboxes (Nelson). Near {{the end of the}} video, the group are accompanied by male backing dancers for a hip hop and chair-dance dance routine in front of a large Union Jack.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, which she has with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on April 3, 2008, at the Sunbeam Studios in London, co-directed by fashion {{photographer}} Tom Munro and Nathan Rissman. The video was shot during Madonna's photo shoot with Elle magazine, for its May cover girl issue. Madonna's retro-chic {{look in the}} video {{was inspired by the}} photoshoot. The video featured a guest appearance from rapper Pharrell Williams; he was portrayed alongside Madonna, singing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> in front of various backdrops. Madonna wore thigh-high PVC boots, visible underwear and sheer tops in the video. The dresses were designed by several fashion brands, including Chanel and Roberto Cavalli.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins a}} short prologue {{sequence}} with several children dressed in animal costumes playing in an overcast field, before cutting to Garbage upon {{the commencement of}} the song. Garbage are located in a litter-strewn warehouse, where the male members of the band destroy vinyl records, videotape and musical instruments as Manson performs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Some sequences feature Manson performing the song while on her own in dilapidated toilet stalls.

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion—including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{positioned}} {{next to each}} other at waist height. They point {{down the length of the}} room and the combined image shows two widely disparate views. Campus walks down the length of the room, and the viewer sees two images of his body doing so. He walks back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and adjusts them, rotating one slightly inward and then the other. As he walks down the room again, the two images of him are much closer together. At a point close up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>the</b> images converge <b>to</b> make a single image of his body. He again approaches <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and turns them further inward. As he walks the length of the room this time, the images of his body are much closer together. The point where they appear as one is far away, at the other side of the room, indicating that he did not only rotate <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> inwards, but also may have inadvertently moved them closer together.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with several scenes interspersing, {{starting}} with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, {{as well as}} Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini. As the song's introduction plays, scenes of the Hawaii beaches are shown, as well as close-up glimpses of T.I. Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and enjoying herself at a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, {{as well as more}} scenes of Hawaiian landscape. By the second verse, Carey, now in a black bikini, is shown {{at the bottom of a}} ravine by the beach staring at the sun, then altering to scenes of the party once more. As T.I.'s verse starts, he's shown behind a waterfall, in the midst of shrubbery outside, where Mariah then appears sitting in a large body of clear water with golden sand. She then lies in the water, as the scene then switches to her underwater with the dolphin again.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E
