5|$|After World War II, this {{division}} was reorganized {{primarily as a}} <b>training</b> <b>division</b> for Reserve forces. After several decades, the division then expanded its role to conducting entry-level training for soldiers of all branches of the Army in the northwestern United States. Its role and size have expanded over that time due to consolidation of other training commands, and the division subsequently took charge {{of a number of}} brigades specializing in various entry-level training for soldiers of all types.|$|E

5|$|By December, {{the three}} ships were {{stationed}} in Tripoli, {{where they were}} replaced by the old ironclads Italia and Lepanto. Re Umberto and her sisters arrived back in La Spezia, where they had their ammunition and supplies replenished. In May 1912, the <b>Training</b> <b>Division</b> patrolled the coast, but saw no action. The following month, Re Umberto and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, {{one of the last}} ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata. Re Umberto {{and the rest of the}} ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July. The <b>Training</b> <b>Division</b> then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast. On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E

5|$|After sailing back to Argentina in March and April 1926, Rivadavia {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the year undergoing sea trials. The dreadnought joined the <b>training</b> <b>division</b> once again in 1927, but after Rivadavia made four training cruises, the division was disbanded, and the ship remained moored in Puerto Belgrano until 1929. This began a series of cyclic activity followed by being demoted to the reserve fleet. Although active in both 1929 and 1930, Rivadavia was placed in reserve on 19 December 1930. Shortly thereafter, it was restored to active service to serve as the flagship for 1931 fleet exercises. Rivadavia went back into reserve in 1932 before coming back out in January 1933. It remained in full commission for {{most of the rest of}} the decade as part of the Battleship Division, alongside Moreno.|$|E

Jagd-Division was under control of 1. Jagd-Korps (1st Fighter Corps) commanded by Generalmajor Joseph Schmid. Lützow was relieved of this command on 16 March 1944 due to personal differences with Schmid. Following his dismissal, {{he was given}} command of the 4.

5|$|Rivadavia was {{commissioned}} into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard, {{although it was}} not fully completed until December. On 23 December 1914, Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina. It arrived in its capital, Buenos Aires, on 19 February 1915. Over 47,000 people came out to see the new ship over the next three days, including the President Victorino de la Plaza. In April 1915, Rivadavia was put into the <b>training</b> <b>division</b> of the Navy, remaining there until 1917, when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division. In 1917, Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers went on strike.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Airborne Division was {{relieved}} of occupation duty on 14 June by British troops, and the division was split up and its component units attached to other airborne divisions, {{either to the}} 82nd Airborne Division in Berlin or to the 13th Airborne Division which was preparing {{to participate in the}} invasion of Japan. When Japan surrendered, all of the division's units returned to their parent formation and the division moved to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, being officially inactivated on 16 September 1945. The formation was reactivated at Camp Pickett, VA, on 6 July 1948 as a <b>training</b> <b>division,</b> but on 19 June 1949 it was permanently inactivated.|$|E

The formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group, that was fighting in Normandy. After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France, the division was disbanded in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was reactivated on 1 December 1946 in the organized reserves in Portland, Oregon. It began {{taking on the}} responsibility of holding training programs for new soldiers of the US Army Reserve. In July 1948, the division held its first session of summer training. By {{the end of the}} training, it had turned out 300 new reservists. By 1952, the {{division was}} turning out 1,500 new reservists per training camp. The division was reorganized specifically as a <b>training</b> <b>division</b> in 1959. In 1961, the division was relocated to Vancouver Barracks, Washington.|$|E
5|$|To expand {{upon the}} concept of Reserve {{component}} and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units' readiness and mobilization exercises.

5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed <b>training</b> <b>division.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1902 the {{air chamber}} of another torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and {{wounding}} three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte.

She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later, in October 1913, Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to the}} <b>Training</b> <b>Division</b> of which she became the flagship in April 1914.|$|E
5|$|Radford took {{command of}} the Aviation <b>Training</b> <b>Division</b> in Washington, D.C. on 1 December 1941, seven days before the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II. He was {{appointed}} as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Bureau of Navigation; the double appointment helped to centralize training coordination for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford's office worked long hours {{six days a week}} in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and he later noted that walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with a direct and no-nonsense approach to work, while maintaining a demeanor that made him easy to work for. He was promoted to captain soon after.|$|E
