5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out before he {{had the chance to}} do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> {{on for the}} start, Pascal Wehrlein {{came to a halt}} in {{the wrong}} grid slot, having mistakenly taken the spot left vacant by Massa, who was {{starting}} from the pitlane. Wehrlein was able to reverse into his slot one row behind just 0.5 seconds before the start light procedure started, avoiding a penalty. At the start, Hamilton got away well from pole position while Hülkenberg lost ground. Button was second as Rosberg moved ahead of Ricciardo and Verstappen. Having gotten a new car built overnight, Daniil Kvyat retired at the end of lap two, after having started from the pitlane. On lap six, Rosberg got ahead of Hülkenberg in fourth position, while Verstappen took advantage and overtook Hülkenberg as well. Räikkönen got ahead of Button into second on lap seven. Tyre stops started on lap nine, as Hülkenberg and Alonso were the first to come in, followed by Button one lap later. After Gutiérrez came past him into ninth on lap 12, Massa headed for the pitlane as well. As Wehrlein made a pit stop on lap 14, Hamilton was still in the lead, followed by Räikkönen and Rosberg.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The duration of the match was 17 minutes and 30 seconds. Jarrett was busted open during the contest. Despite this being a standard wrestling match, Jarrett and Rhino used weapons throughout and primarily fought outside of the ring. Jarrett hit Rhino with a chair while the two stood on a scaffolding, causing Rhino to fall off and crash through a table. Rhino attempted to tackle Jarrett through a table {{set up on the}} entrance ramp. He succeeded, but the table did not break. Team Canada interfered afterwards, trying to stop Rhino from getting to the ring before the referee counted both Rhino and Jarrett out. They failed as Rhino came rushing back into the ring before the count finished. Jarrett pinned Rhino after slamming Rhino face-first with his signature Stroke maneuver onto several steel chairs. As such, Jarrett retained the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After the title match, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> off with the logo of the wrestler Sting appearing on the screens in the arena, thus being the major announcement advertised for the show.|$|E

The following year (1968), she {{starred in the}} comedy film Where Were You When <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> Out? which centers on the Northeast blackout of November 9, 1965. Her final feature, the comedy With Six You Get Eggroll, was released in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{passengers}} on board San Juan were able to jump onto {{the deck of the}} S.C.T. Dodd before the two ships drifted apart. Not long after the collision occurred, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out on board the San Juan. While heading up to the San Juan's deck, passenger George Houghton, observed a group of distressed passengers by the main stairwell, shouting at each other and praying. Houghton compared the sight to Dante's Inferno. Shortly after the collision, the San Juan began to capsize on its port side and start sinking stern first. Wireless operator Clifford Paulson hurriedly returned to his room and began sending out distress signals. Soon after a single ship had replied, water rushed in through Paulson's door and completely flooded his room. Luckily, Paulson was able to escape.|$|E

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{continued their}} rivalry with their individual opponents before reuniting for a rematch {{on the last}} SmackDown! before Armageddon. This time, the match {{would go to a}} double disqualification as Kennedy threatened to run over Kane with a hearse parked ringside. The Undertaker, who had run off MVP, emerged in the passenger seat as his gong tolled and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out, thus scaring Kennedy out of the vehicle. At Armageddon, Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match, which was why the hearse had been at ringside for the last two weeks, and Kane defeated MVP earlier in an inferno match. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers would reunite once again, defeating King Booker and Finlay, before parting ways as Kane began a rivalry with The Great Khali while Undertaker successfully pursued the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23.|$|E
25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked up the ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music. After he disappeared, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} the Brothers of Destruction was {{announced}} on October 27, 2006 episode of SmackDown!. Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) interfered with Kane's match against Mr. Kennedy, helping Kennedy beat down on him before <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out and the Undertaker's music came on. When the lights came back on Kane was gone, nowhere to be found. As {{a result of the}} interference, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match: The Brothers of Destruction vs. Kennedy and MVP. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers of Destruction reunited {{for the first time as}} a tag team in five years and gathered three wins over MVP and Mr Kennedy in that one night. The first win was made by countout, the second was by a disqualification at which point General Manager Theodore Long twice came out and restarted the match with no disqualifications or countouts. Finally, the brothers hit simultaneous chokeslams, and Undertaker finished with a Tombstone Piledriver to Mr. Kennedy.|$|E

25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E
500|$|After collaborating in 2002's Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were {{interested}} in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, [...] "He's such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. [...] I love working with Tom Cruise." [...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, [...] "We {{looked at each other}} and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> on. [...] As soon as I heard it, I said 'Oh my God!

500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea." ...|$|E

500|$|McEntire {{dedicated}} her eighteenth album, For My Broken Heart, to her deceased road band. Released in October 1991, {{it contained}} songs of sorrow and lost love about [...] "all measure of suffering," [...] according to Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly. Nash reported that McEntire [...] "still hits her stride {{with the more}} traditional songs of emotional turmoil, above all combining a spectacular vocal performance with a terrific song on 'Buying Her Roses,' a wife's head-spinning discovery of her husband's other woman." [...] The release peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, while also reaching No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and eventually sold four million copies. Its title track became McEntire's sixteenth number-one, followed by [...] "Is There Life Out There", which also reached No. 1 on the Billboard country music chart. The third single, [...] "The Greatest Man I Never Knew," [...] peaked in the Top 5 and her cover of Vicki Lawrence's [...] "The Night <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> Out in Georgia" [...] reached No. 12. [...] "If I Had Only Known," [...] a cut from this album, was later included in the soundtrack to the 1994 film 8 Seconds.|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E
