40|$|Witness {{intimidation}} is {{a fundamental}} threat {{to the rule of}} law. It also involves signi…cant strategic complexity and two-sided uncertainty: a criminal cannot know whether his threat will e¤ectively deter a witness from testifying, and a witness cannot know whether the threat will in fact be carried out. We model this interaction and explore the manner in which equilibrium rates of intimidation, testimony, and conviction respond to changes in prosecutorial e¤ectiveness, police-community relations, and witness protection programs. An increase in prosecutorial e¤ectiveness raises the incentives for criminals to <b>threaten</b> <b>witnesses</b> but also makes these threats less credible. Sometimes the rise in threats will be large enough to drive down the rate of conviction, with the paradoxical outcome that better prosecutors may convict fewer criminals. Direct attempts to reduce witness tampering may also prove counterproductive. When the harm faced by a witness itself depends on whether or not the criminal is convicted, communities can be trapped in equilibria with collective silence: no witness testi…es because none expects others to testify...|$|R

50|$|Skrmetta {{is one of}} five {{public service}} commissioners; colleagues include Foster Campbell and Clyde C. Holloway. Skrmetta {{authored}} a new order that more thoroughly regulates taxicab service, improving public safety. He worked with local utilities to make payment centers more convenient, protected consumers from unwanted Smart Meter installation, and worked with AT&T to make delivery of phone directories optional, saving money and environmental impact. Skrmetta worked with regulators to regionalize management of electricity in a more free-market approach, and oversaw a major transmission project in Acadiana that improves delivery and reliability of services. He fought against federal regulations that overburdened utility providers, saving costs that would have been passed on to ratepayers. Skrmetta’s efforts have saved Louisiana ratepayers more than $4 billion. Skrmetta worked with utility providers to improve disaster response and utility restoration, and encouraged utility companies to enhance pre-storm preparations like tree trimming and other advance remedies. He also fought utility companies when they wanted unjustified recovery charges from consumers. Skrmetta worked to expand residential solar access without across-the-board ratepayers subsidies, and worked to improve water systems throughout his district. Skrmetta protected prison telephone monitoring systems to keep criminals from being able to use telecommunications to <b>threaten</b> <b>witnesses</b> or direct new crimes.|$|R

50|$|Which party (if either) {{was legally}} or morally {{in the right}} it is now {{difficult}} to say: it is suspicious that both parties were relying on documents whose very existence had been previously unknown, and {{it is quite possible}} that both the will and the deed were forged. Fitton proceeded to make a serious mistake in publishing a pamphlet directly accusing Gerard of winning the case by bribing and <b>threatening</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and including what purported to be Granger's confession that he had committed perjury.Fitton was perhaps unaware that to libel a peer was scandalum magnatum, a criminal offence. The House of Lords took a serious view of the matter and Fitton was committed to the King's Bench Prison until if ever he produced Granger to confirm his story. Given Granger's character, it is hardly surprising that Fittton never did produce him, and he might well have remained in prison for life. As it was (though accounts differ) he may still have been in prison in 1687. The petition to the House of Commons of England in 1668 mentioned in Pepys' Diary cane to nothing as did an attempt to prosecute Gerard's witnesses for perjury. The disgrace of Gerard, now Earl of Macclesfield, who supported the Exclusion Bill and was later suspected of complicity in the Monmouth Rebellion, encouraged Fitton to make one last effort to recover Gawsworth; somewhat surprisingly his case was dismissed for undue delay. The affair however caused the new King James II to look favourably on Fitton.|$|R
