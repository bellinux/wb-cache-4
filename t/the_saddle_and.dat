Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E

Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E

25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends to stay out of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
25|$|Over time, as new {{technologies}} were introduced, the nomadic horsemen grew in power. The Scythians developed <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> <b>and</b> {{by the time}} of the Alans the use of the stirrup had begun. Horses continued to grow larger and sturdier so that chariots were no longer needed as the horses could carry men with ease. This greatly increased the mobility of the nomads; it also freed their hands, allowing them to use the bow from horseback.|$|E

25|$|In a half-seat position, the rider's seat {{bones are}} lifted out of <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> <b>and</b> only the pelvis has contact. It {{is used for}} jumping when some seat aid may be necessary, {{especially}} for sharp turns, when riding downhills, on the approach to potentially spooky fences, or when the rider wishes to collect the stride. This seat is a compromise, allowing the jumping rider to have greater control than in two-point, but still keeping {{the majority of the}} rider's weight off the horse's back.|$|E
25|$|A stirrup {{is a light}} frame or {{ring that}} holds {{the foot of a}} rider, {{attached}} to the saddle by a strap, often called a stirrup leather. Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare.|$|E
25|$|To not be jostled out of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> to {{not harm}} the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills {{in order to}} sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, {{but to do so}} requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E

Union resistance stiffened {{late in the}} morning, however, and as McCulloch rode forward to scout out enemy positions, he was shot out of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> died instantly.

25|$|In January 1862, Union General George H. Thomas {{began to}} advance on George B. Crittenden's {{position}} at Mill Springs. In rainy conditions, Thomas' army moved slowly, and Crittenden advanced {{to meet them}} before they could be reinforced by forces from nearby Somerset. The battle commenced on January 19, 1862, and favored Crittenden's forces early on. However, in the confusion caused by the rain and fog, Felix Zollicoffer, commander of Crittenden's First Brigade, rode into {{the midst of the}} Union forces. A Confederate officer galloped in, yelling at Zollicoffer to inform him of his mistake. Upon being identified, Zollicoffer was shot out of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> killed, disheartening the Confederates and turning the tide of the battle. Thomas' reinforcements arrived, and Crittenden's forces were forced to retreat across the flooded Cumberland River. Many drowned in the process, and Crittenden was given the blame for the debacle.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} saw the {{outbreak}} of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which opposed France to Prussia and Russia. On 5 October 1806, Lhéritier was promoted to Colonel and given the command of the 10th Cuirassiers, a prestigious heavy cavalry regiment, formerly called Royal Cravates during the Ancien Régime, and which traced its origins back to the reign of Louis XIII. The regiment was a part of Marie Adrien François Guiton's 2nd Brigade of General d'Hautpoul's 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division. The division saw no major action during the 1806 campaign, but was heavily engaged at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807. There, Colonel Lhéritier led his cuirassiers during Marshal Murat's famous cavalry charge. Lhéritier was wounded at his right hand when his horse was killed under him, but was soon back in <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> took off again at the head of his regiment in another charge. His senior commander, General d'Hautpoul, was fatally wounded during his heroic charge at Eylau. The 10th Cuirassiers took little part in the fighting that followed that battle.|$|E

Desert Mounted Corps concentrated, with their supplies being carried in massed horse–drawn transport and on endless strings of camels, clogging every road.

500|$|Most medieval women rode astride. [...] Although {{an early}} chair-like sidesaddle with handles and a {{footrest}} was {{available by the}} 13th century and allowed women of the nobility to ride while wearing elaborate gowns, they were not universally adopted during the Middle Ages. [...] This was {{largely due to the}} insecure seat they offered, which necessitated a smooth-gaited horse being led by another handler. The sidesaddle did not become practical for everyday riding until the 16th-century development of the pommel horn that allowed a woman to hook her leg around <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>and</b> hence use the reins to control her own horse.
