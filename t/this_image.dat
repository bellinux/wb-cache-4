5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E

5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid.

40|$|The {{number of}} high {{resolution}} space imageries, {{in the civilian}} market is growing fast. <b>This</b> <b>images</b> have great interest in the photogrammetric and remote sensing communities. The problem with <b>this</b> <b>images</b> for many users, {{at the present time}} is the lack of sensor calibration information and precise ephemeris data. Consequently {{it is not possible to}} apply the precise mathematical models such as orbital parameter model to determine the dynamic geometry of them at the time of imaging. Therefore for, there is a need for an alternative approach to extract 2 D and 3 D spatial information from <b>this</b> <b>images.</b> <b>This</b> paper presents a mathematical solution to extract planimetric information as accurate as possible from IKONOS. This method uses Genetic Algorithm technique to find the best terms of global polynomial that provides the best fitness model of the imagery to the ground space. Using the output of global polynomial in multiquadric transformation gives better results in term of accuracy. The result of this method is compared with other 2 D mathematical models such as global polynomial, 2 D direct linear transformation and multi-quadric models. Also the model is applied to the IRS- 1 C imagery...|$|R
40|$|The images which {{consist of}} RGB color images {{is known as}} vector valued <b>images.</b> <b>This</b> <b>images</b> is the {{multimodal}} images which shows strong inter-channel correlation among each other. We treat <b>this</b> <b>images</b> by the new notion by introducing the spatial gradient channels. We can obtained the vector valued through minimizing the cost functional that penalizes the large angles. After this we introduce the Gateaux derivative that leads to diffusion gradient decent scheme. The cost functional gives the several examples of denoising and demosaicking. These shows that demosaicking will gives visually perfect image for the low noise by parallel level set preceded by denoising. We get the result that after introducing all the idea to the image we will yield the better result than any other approaches...|$|R

The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers. <b>This</b> <b>image</b> marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing <b>this</b> <b>image</b> herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had ever been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological.

Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What <b>this</b> <b>image</b> almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
