5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, {{knowledge of how}} these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics {{and a number of}} specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E

25|$|One {{branch of}} musical set theory deals with {{collections}} (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), {{which may be}} ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, inversion, and complementation.

25|$|Before 1748 and the {{publication}} of Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the Infinite, the natural logarithm was known {{in terms of the}} area of a hyperbolic sector. Leonhard Euler changed that when he introduced transcendental functions such as 10x. Euler identified e as the value of b producing a unit of area (under the hyperbola or in a hyperbolic sector in standard position). Then the natural logarithm could be recognized as the inverse function to the transcendental function ex.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, {{the ideas}} of {{sequential}} Monte Carlo (SMC) and population Monte Carlo (PMC) methods have been adapted to the ABC setting. The general idea is to iteratively approach the posterior from the prior through a sequence of target distributions. An advantage of such methods, compared to ABC-MCMC, is that the samples from the resulting posterior are independent. In addition, with sequential methods the tolerance levels must not be specified prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis,</b> but are adjusted adaptively.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{conclusion}} was unknown, {{the first generation}} proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much {{of the work of}} proving these theorems was devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.|$|E
