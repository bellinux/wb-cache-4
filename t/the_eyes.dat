500|$|Ra is {{not unique}} in this {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Other solar gods may interact {{in a similar way}} with the numerous goddesses associated with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Hathor, a goddess of the sky, the sun, and fertility, is often called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra, and she also has a relationship with Horus, who also has solar connections, that is similar to the relationship between Ra and his Eye. Hathor can even be called [...] "the Eye of Horus"—one of several ways in which the distinctions between <b>the</b> two <b>eyes</b> are blurred. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> can also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra.

5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape.

5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> more distinct dark coloring around <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> Effects usually include tears streaming from <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>eye</b> {{needs to}} be held at a certain {{distance}} behind <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> relief. A larger eye relief means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> relief is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> in <b>the</b> correct position {{for an extended period of}} time, for which reason some eyepieces with long eye relief have cups behind <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the case of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass.|$|R
