In recent years, the application of deformation sensors in machine structures has been examined in detail. The development of suitable mathematical models utilizing the sensor's signals for actual correction methods has proven to be the key challenge.

However, the computational cost of FE models and restriction to generic algorithms in commercial tools like ANSYS prevents their operational use since simulations have to run faster than real-time. For the case where heat diffusion is slow compared to machine movement, we introduce a tailored implicit-explicit multi-rate time stepping method of higher order based on spectral deferred corrections. Using the open-source FEM library DUNE, we show that fully coupled simulations of the temperature field are possible in real-time for a machine consisting of a stock sliding up and down on rails attached to a stand...|$|E

Therefore, a new method is introduced to determine the dynamic vibrations of a tool by comparing the geometrical profile of the tool with the dynamical profile at a high rotational speed. The necessary steps for measuring the signals and calculating the underlying dynamic vibrations of the tool are presented here. Afterwards, the unbalance-induced vibrations of a milling tool are shown {{as well as their}} influence on the eccentricity of the rotation axis.

40|$|Abstract- In this study, a {{technique}} {{will be presented}} to measure the absolute position of a robot and any other strategic positions within the workcell, and also its specially built control software. One of the most important factors affecting the absolute or world accuracy of robots is the variation in arm geometry from a perfect kinematics form. Since arm position is essentially controlled by means of joint angles, Cartesian co-ordinates of the <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> are derived from the forward kinematics transform equations assuming a perfect kinematics form. Any deviation from this perfect case will result in world positional errors and hence, for effective off-line programming it is important to calibrate the real robot hardware against the virtual model used by the robot simulation computer systems. This paper will report on work carried out in developing such low cost calibration technique, its PC Based control software and performance monitoring systems...|$|E
40|$|Robot <b>Tool</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> (TCP) {{calibration}} {{problem is}} of great importance {{for a number of}} industrial applications, and it is well known both in theory and in practice. Although various techniques have been proposed for solving this problem, they mostly require tool jogging or long processing time, both of which affect process performance by extending cycle time. This paper presents an innovative way of TCP calibration using a set of two cameras. The robot tool is placed in an area where images in two orthogonal planes are acquired using cameras. Using robust pattern recognition, even deformed tool can be identified on images, and information about its current position and orientation forwarded to control unit for calibration. Compared to other techniques, test results show significant reduction in procedure complexity and calibration time. These improvements enable more frequent TCP checking and recalibration during production, thus improving the product quality...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} time-optimal path tracking for industrial robots. More specifically, three subproblems are studied and experimentally evaluated. The {{first is a}} contact-force control approach for determining the geometric robot motion, such that the <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> of the robot is moved according to the specification. The second problem is off-line solution of the optimisation problem describing the time-optimal path tracking problem, by using software which allows highlevel implementation and solution of optimisation problems. The third problem is robust control of the robot during real-time path tracking based on the optimisation results determined off-line. An earlier developed control structure for robust control is implemented and tested in a robot system. This paper discusses the theory behind time-optimal path tracking and presents experimental results. Both contact-force controlled path identification and real-time path tracking of the identified path are evaluated on a 6 -DOF industrial robot of type IRB 140 from ABB...|$|E

We analyse {{a unique set of}} data collated from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that allows the identification of trades and orders in its <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> dark pool. This study contributes to the understanding of factors that influence traders' preference to transact through an exchange operated dark pool and the execution probability of dark orders. We also examine the impact of <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> dark pool trading on market quality. The results show that the level of trading activity in the dark pool is higher for larger stocks with lower prices.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an improved method for the geometrical calibration of parallel robots {{for which the}} structure is based upon some parallelogram mechanisms. Its originality is to identify the complete geometry of the mechanism's parallelograms, and to compensate the positioning error of the TCP (<b>Tool</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>Point),</b> due to the infinitesimal rotation of the traveling plate, induced by the parallelogram geometrical errors. The main difficulties are: (i) to derive the calibration model relative to all geometrical parameters, and (ii) to reuse the identified errors in a control model in order to compensate the positioning errors. In fact, the position relationship {{taking into account the}} full geometry of the parallelograms is difficult, not to say impossible, to derive in a close form; therefore a linear approximation of the model is proposed. The formulas necessary to run the method on a Delta robot are given. Then a simple mechanism is used to illustrate the benefits of this method compared to classical ones...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the issues that}} should be covered {{in order to develop}} walk-through programming techniques (i. e. a manual guidance of the robot) in an industrial scenario.

Then, the paper discusses a way to implement such dynamics on an industrial robot equipped with an open robot control system and a wrist force/torque sensor, as well as the safety issues related to the walk-through programming. In particular, two strategies that make use of admittance control to constrain the robot motion are presented. One slows down the robot when the velocity of the <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> exceeds a specified safety limit, the other one limits the robot workspace by way of virtual safety surfaces. Experimental results on a COMAU Smart Six robot are presented, showing the performance of the walk-through programming system endowed with the two proposed safety strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to develop a position-based visual servoing system with two webcams that allows an {{anthropomorphic}} robot ABB IRB 120 with six degrees of freedom (DOF) to be guided in real time by an operator, by triangulating a specific target moved within the field of view (FOV) of a machine vision system. For this kind of motion control based on visual data input, termed visual servoing control, we need a stereo vision system to acquire the images of the target since three-dimensional information is required to perform object tracking with six DOF. These images are processed by a MATLAB ap-plication running in a remote PC. The current coordinates of the target referred to the left camera reference frame are extracted from the images and sent through an Ethernet connec-tion to the robot controller, which is programmed to receive the vectors and move its <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> (TCP) to the demanded position within its workspace.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{flexible}} link parallel manipulators {{is still an}} open area of research, endpoint trajectory tracking {{being one of the}} main challenges in this type of robot. The flexibility and deformations of the limbs make the estimation of the <b>Tool</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> (TCP) position a challenging one. Authors have proposed different approaches to estimate this deformation and deduce the location of the TCP. However, most of these approaches require expensive measurement systems or the use of high computational cost integration methods. This work presents a novel approach based on a virtual sensor which can not only precisely estimate the deformation of the flexible links in control applications (less than 2 % error), but also its derivatives (less than 6 % error in velocity and 13 % error in acceleration) according to simulation results. The validity of the proposed Virtual Sensor is tested in a Delta Robot, where the position of the TCP is estimated based on the Virtual Sensor measurements with less than a 0. 03 % of error in comparison with the flexible approach developed in ADAMS Multibody Software...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an enhanced}} method to analytically identify an unknown <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> (TCP) of standard industrial robots with {{six degrees of}} freedom. The method uses a mathematical closed form to determine the position and orientation (pose) of a mounted robot tool frame {{in relation to the}} robot flange frame. This unknown pose is represented by a homogeneous transformation that is calculated by performing two robot movements. The position and orientation of the robot is measured after each movement, which leads to an equation of the form, where represents the unknown homogeneous transformation from the robot flange to the TCP. The achievable accuracy in comparison to existing methods is enhanced by using relative movements with orthogonal rotational axes. This ensures optimal error propagation for solving the resulting equation and leads to a very accurate calculation of the unknown transformation. The described method was evaluated and tested on a standard industrial robot. All measurements to determine the position and orientation of the robot tool were done with a laser tracker. A typical application example from the field of automated machining demonstrates the use of the developed method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Knowledge about {{temperature}} fields and heat flow evolving during metal cutting pro-cesses is of significant importance for ensuring and predicting the product quality. Furthermore, this knowledge enables an improved usage of {{resources such as}} machine tools and tool deployment. The strength of the heat sources {{as a result of}} the process and the distribution of the temperature in the material directly influence the tool wear mechanisms, wear rate, thermo-elastic deflection of the <b>tool</b> <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> and the amount of heat flowing into the newly generated work piece surface. Especially the latter effect is of crucial importance when it comes to safety critical components as they are em-ployed in aero-engines. In aviation industry, the surface integrity is used as a complex quality meas-ure summarising several aspects at the machined surface and sub-surface out of which many are predominantly thermal issues (e. g. temperature driven hardening of the work piece material, re-cast and white etching layers as well as residual stress profiles). Due to the indicated importance of temperature measurement, modelling research activities have been going on in this field since decades. The vast majority of published work, however, is focused on empirical modelling or simplified models for an average temperature in the tool. Present analytical models for temperature distributions are almost exclusively based on one analytical solu...|$|E

The SCARA configuration of the hexapod robot legs will allow low energy consumption when the robot executes gaits on flat terrain or with reduced slope, due the decoupling of gravitational effects. This legged robot has a mass about 250 kg, and it can bear a high payload up to about 300 kg. Considering this load characteristic then the vibrational effects on the scanning manipulator will be reduced, when this carry out scanning tasks over the terrain. info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP 7 / 284747; The authors acknowledge funding of this work under TIRAMISU Project - Grant Agreement Nº 284747 of the 7 FP, and partial funding from the RoboCity 2030 -III-CM project (Robótica aplicada a la mejora de la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos.
