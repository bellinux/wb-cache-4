Although pioneering {{the use of}} turbojet power as the first naval fighter with an afterburner and composite material construction, the aircraft proved to be underpowered and was judged unsuitable for combat. None were ever issued to operational squadrons and they were relegated to development, <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> roles before they were withdrawn from service in 1950.|$|E
25|$|The B-36, {{including}} its GRB-36, RB-36, and XC-99 variants, was in USAF service {{as part of}} the Strategic Air Command from 1948 to 1959. The RB-36 variants of the B-36 were used for reconnaissance during the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the B-36 bomber variants conducted <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> operations and stood ground and airborne alert, but the latter variants were never used offensively as bombers against hostile forces; it never fired a shot in combat.|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 1897 maneuvers, Württemberg was taken into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for reconstruction. The ship's old wrought iron and teak armor was replaced with new Krupp nickel-steel armor. The four funnels were trunked into a single large funnel and new engines were also installed, which increased the ship's speed to [...] The ship's 8.7cm guns were replaced with quick-firing [...] SK L/30 guns and four [...] autocannons. Work was completed in 1898. Württemberg remained with the fleet until 1906; her replacement in the fleet organization plan, the new dreadnought battleship , was ordered that year. Württemberg was then used as a torpedo <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> ship until February 1919, when she was reduced to an escort for F-type minesweepers. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 20 October 1920 and sold to Hattinger Co. Württemberg was ultimately broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E

The 1550th received Kaman HH-43 Huskie rescue helicopters in 1973, although it ended operations with the HH-43 in 1975. In late 1975, the 1550th included nine Sikorsky HH-53B/C [...] "Super Jolly Green Giant" [...] helicopters and one Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion for training. On 15 March 1976, the squadron was relocated to Kirtland Air Force Base, where it added responsibility for search and rescue missions.|$|E

[...] The group moved to the European Theater of Operations in the Spring 1944 expansion of Ninth Air Force in England in preparation for Operation Overlord. [...] It few its first combat mission on 1 May 1944. [...] The group moved to France in late June and continued in combat until V-E Day. [...] During combat operations over Western Europe, the unit received two Distinguished Unit Citations. [...] It returned to the United States, where it was inactivated on 7 November 1945.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{projects}} {{to create new}} variants {{were based on the}} original Schneider CA design. On 27 September 1916 Estienne wrote a memorandum to the General Headquarters outlining his thoughts about a possible command tank. Considering that tank units would not only attack static enemy positions but also had to manoeuvre on the battlefield against moving hostile troops, he foresaw that their commanders would need more agile vehicles with armament and armour concentrated in the front, to lead a pursuit or cover a retreat. [...] Therefore, a variant was needed fitted with a turret featuring a 37mm gun and one or two machine-guns in the front instead of the sides, protected by 15mm front armour, with a crew of four and with a top speed of at least 10km/h. Fifty such vehicles should be constructed. [...] On 2 October, Joffre demanded the production of fifty voitures cuirassées de commandement. On 13 October Schneider had a paper design ready; on 17 October the order was confirmed by Mourret. Towards the end of 1916 a [...] "mock-up" [...] was ready under the designation of Schneider CA2. On 26 and 27 March 1917 a prototype made of boiler-plate, perhaps identical to the [...] "mock-up", was tested at Marly. It had the standard suspension of the Schneider CA but its hull was strongly shortened so that the overhanging nose had disappeared. The 75mm cannon had been replaced by a cylindrical turret, intended to be armed with a 47mm gun and a machine-gun, close {{to the rear of the}} hull. The hull was further diminished in size and weight by a considerable narrowing, and closing of the roofed skylight slit, which lowered its height. As a result, the type weighed only eight tonnes. [...] During the testing the vehicle, though no longer getting itself stuck on an overhanging nose, still proved unable to climb out of muddy shell craters. [...] It was concluded that the suspension should be lengthened by the equivalence of three track links, about forty centimetres, and on 13 April 1917 a quick commencement of production was envisaged. In reality Estienne had already on 22 March decided to discontinue this project in favour of a Renault FT command (signal) version. The CA2 prototype was subsequently used as a <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> bed vehicle and the immediate need for command vehicles was met by fitting two standard Schneider CAs with radio sets. On 29 December 1916 it was proposed to develop from the Schneider CA2 two light tank prototypes.|$|E
