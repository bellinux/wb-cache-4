Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit.</b> After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which {{of them will be}} eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously.

Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the [...] "author and creator". As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began threatening Welles <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> for the film—including threats to place full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend Ben Hecht to write an exposé for The Saturday Evening Post. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the Screen Writers Guild and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.|$|E
500|$|Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapić, who met after Florey {{attended}} one of Vorkapić's American Society of Cinematographers lectures, {{are credited}} as co-writers and co-directors of The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra. Accounts differ {{as to the}} level of involvement the two men had {{in the creation of the}} film, but most identify Florey as primarily responsible. Film historian Brian Taves has claimed Vorkapić was not involved in the writing or direction of the film, and that his contribution was limited to set design and miniature lighting, but that Florey nevertheless insisted on sharing equal credit with him for his role in bringing the film to fruition. Some early journalistic stories about the film uphold this viewpoint, including a 1928 article about Florey in Hollywood Magazine. Taves further claims that while Vorkapić did nothing to promote the film when it was first released, he later exaggerated his role in the production of the film when it became so esteemed. Paul Ivano, who did camerawork on the film, echoed these sentiments, saying: [...] "Vorkapić tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit,</b> but he didn't do much." [...] For his part, Vorkapić himself has said the initial idea was Florey's, and that they discussed it and drafted a rough one-page synopsis together. But Vorkapić said [...] "all the effects were devised, designed, photographed, and added by me", and that [...] "at least 90 percent of the editing and montage" [...] was his work. He claims to have directed most of the opening and ending sequences himself, while he credits Florey with filming the casting scene and shots of laughing extras, and said the rise of Voya George's character to stardom was filmed jointly.|$|E

2500|$|Brennan {{rejected}} Marquette National's {{argument that}} just because First National was soliciting credit card customers in Minnesota, it was [...] "located" [...] in that state for purposes of the credit card program. [...] "Minnesota residents were always free to visit Nebraska and receive loans in that state." [...] It hadn't been suggested that Minnesota's laws would apply in that instance, he added. Therefore, they shouldn't be applied just because [...] "the convenience of modern mail" [...] allowed Minnesotans <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> without having to visit Nebraska. He dismissed another of the plaintiffs' arguments, that the National Banking Act had also intended to preserve [...] "competitive equality", between state and national banks by citing language from the original adoption of the statute and supporting documents to demonstrate that it was always Congress's intent to create a national banking system. The Court itself had taken notice of interstate lending as early as 1839, and the 1863 Congress, Brennan said, was equally aware of such transactions and {{did not wish to}} discourage them.|$|E

2500|$|This {{judicial}} ruling meant that Lee de Forest was now legally {{recognized in the}} United States as the inventor of regeneration. However, much of the engineering community continued to consider Armstrong to be the actual developer, with de Forest viewed as someone who skillfully used the patent system <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> for an invention {{to which he had}} barely contributed. Following the 1934 Supreme Court decision, Armstrong attempted to return his Institute of Radio Engineers (present-day Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Medal of Honor, which had been awarded to him in 1917 [...] "in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion", but the organization's board refused to let him, stating that it [...] "strongly affirms the original award". The practical effect of de Forest's victory was that his company was free to sell products that used regeneration, for during the controversy, which became more a personal feud than a business dispute, Armstrong tried to block the company from even being licensed to sell equipment under his patent.|$|E
