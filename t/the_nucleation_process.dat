40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{well known}} that oxide glasses build up {{continuous}} networks. Therefore the rigidity of the latter {{plays a key role in}} understanding glass properties.

Some tiny floppy regions still exist inside the rigid network close above the threshold concentration. They can serve as active centers for <b>the</b> beginning of <b>nucleation</b> <b>process.</b> Much later, <b>nucleation</b> can appear in the rigid part of the network.

50|$|Window frost (also called fern frost or ice flowers) forms when a {{glass pane}} {{is exposed to}} very cold air {{on the outside and}} warmer, {{moderately}} moist air on the inside. If the pane is not a good insulator (for example, if it is a single pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear {{on the bottom of the}} window even with double pane energy efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles the frost will usually form on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences the shape of crystals, so imperfections, scratches, or dust can modify the way ice nucleates. The patterns in window frost form a fractal with a fractal dimension greater than one but less than two. This is a consequence of <b>the</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process</b> being constrained to unfold in two dimensions, unlike a snowflake which is shaped by a similar process but forms in three dimensions and has a fractal dimension greater than two.|$|E
50|$|Bubble {{nucleation}} {{happens when}} the a volatile becomes saturated. Actually the bubbles are composed of molecules that tend to aggregate spontaneously in a process called homogeneous nucleation. The surface tension acts on the bubbles shrinking the surface and forces {{them back to the}} liquid. <b>The</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process</b> is greater when the space to fit is irregular and the volatile molecules can ease the effect of surface tension. The nucleation can occur thanks to the presence of solid crystals, which are stored in the magma chamber. They are perfect potential nucleation sites for bubbles. If there is no nucleation in the magma the bubbles formation might appear really late and magma becomes significantly supersaturated. The balance between supersaturation pressure and bubble's radii expressed by this equation: ∆P=2σ/r, where ∆P is 100 MPa and σ is the surface tension. If the nucleation starts later when the magma is very supersaturated, the distance between bubbles becomes smaller. Essentially if the magma rises rapidly to the surface, the system will be more out of equilibrium and supersaturated. When the magma rises there is competition between adding new molecules to the existing ones and creating new ones. The distance between molecules characterizes the efficiency of volatiles to aggregate to the new or existing site. Crystals inside magma can determine how bubbles grow and nucleate.|$|E

Chamber description and characterisation [...] Chapter 3. Particle-into-liquid sampler and ion chromatography [...] Chapter 4. MEA chamber experiments [...] Chapter 5. Conclusions and outlook. Fugitive emissions of amines, such as monoethanolamine (MEA, 2 -aminoethan- 1 -ol) or piperazine (PZ, diazacyclohexane) from industrial plants {{have the potential}} to generate aerosol under photooxidative conditions, yet the reaction mechanisms and <b>nucleation</b> <b>process</b> of these amine-systems is poorly understood. This project is aimed at developing a methodology to analyse <b>the</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process(es)</b> of these amine emissions. This included characterising CSIRO's new third generation environmental chamber and incorporating a semi-online Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler/Ion Chromatography (PILS-IC) system. The PILS-IC is required for the direct identification and quantification of water-soluble organic and inorganic fractions of aerosol mass. Chamber characterisation was achieved through several experiments including the determination of the NO₂ photolysis rate (0. 512 ± 0. 027 s⁻¹), the wall loss rate of ozone (5. 6112 ± 0. 0011) × 10 ⁻⁷ s⁻¹ and the wall loss coefficient β for particles in the bins 54. 1 – 181. 1 nm. During MEA irradiation experiments, the PILC-IC showed some expected trends. However, there are still several chamber auxiliary mechanisms and instrument refinements which require attention before the next stage.

50|$|The surface {{environment}} {{does not}} play a decisive role {{in the formation of}} ice and snow. The density fluctuations inside drops result in that the possible freezing regions cover the middle and the surface regions. The freezing from the surface or from within may be random. However, in the strange world of water, tiny amounts of liquid water theoretically still are present, even as temperatures go below minus 48 C (minus 55 F) and almost all the water has turned solid, either into crystalline ice or amorphous water. Below minus 48 C (minus 55 F), ice is crystallizing too fast for any property of the remaining liquid to be measured.The freezing speed directly influences <b>the</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process</b> and ice crystal size. A supercooled liquid will stay in a liquid state below the normal freezing point when it has little opportunity for nucleation; that is, if it is pure enough and has a smooth enough container. Once agitated it will rapidly become a solid.During the final stage of freezing, an ice drop develops a pointy tip, which is not observed for most other liquids, arises because water expands as it freezes. Once the liquid is completely frozen, the sharp tip of the drop attracts water vapor in the air, much like a sharp metal lightning rod attracts electrical charges. The water vapor collects on the tip and a tree of small ice crystals starts to grow. An opposite effect has been shown to preferentially extract water molecules from the sharp edge of potato wedges in the oven.|$|E

The increase in volume due to foam formation and its exothermic reactivity was taken into consideration. Thereby, the amount of cell nuclei in the initial phase was examinable and cell growth including coalescence could be followed. The initial nuclei compared favourably to the final number of cells and to their size, providing a consistency with real foaming conditions. Detailed research was carried out on the effect of various types and amounts of blowing agents (e. g. carbon dioxide, cyclopentane, perfluoroalkanes), surfactants, catalysts, fillers and isocyanates on <b>the</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process.</b> Other important factors influencing <b>the</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>process</b> are the component 2 ̆ 7 s viscosity and surface tension and their relationship with each other during the foaming process.

Contrary to the literature, the initial number of nuclei did not vary with respect to surfactant type. Nucleation numbers proved to be independent of surface tensions values proving that lowering the surface tension does not automatically ensure higher nucleation numbers. Surfactants were shown to have either stabilising or emulsifying abilities.
