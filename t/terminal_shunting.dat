40|$|The ZR 431 is an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} industry standard 431. It is a three <b>terminal</b> <b>shunt</b> regulator giving excellent temperature stability and the capability of operating at currents from 50 µA up to 100 mA. Its output voltage can be set to any voltage {{in the range of}} Vref (2. 5 V) to 20 V by the addition of two external divider resistors. The reference input current is typically only 100 nA, so high value resistors can be used without error. Its minimum operating current and reference input current are ten times lower than industry standard 431 parts. (Please refer to Appendix A) Fol lowing are a few example applications of the ZR 431 which show how the parts can be used. Shunt Regulator The ZR 431 is ideal for providing low voltage stabi l ised suppl ies or references. Simple low output voltage supplies can be difficult to build as the components normally used, such as zener diodes or band gap references, are either too poor in performance or not avai lab le at the desired vol tage (band-gap devices are usually fixed at 2. 5 V or 5 V with no intermediate values). The circuit in Figure 1 shows a 3 V shunt regulator utilising the ZR 431. The output of this supply can be set to any voltage in the range 2. 5 V to 20 V by adjusting the ratio of R 1 and R 2, following the relationship:...|$|R

30|$|This {{terminal}} structure {{makes it}} relatively inefficient to transfer containers from intermodal <b>terminals</b> to the <b>shunting</b> yard. Each <b>terminal</b> uses Swiss split {{only for a}} few containers per day so that the trains to the shunting yard are quite short. In addition, the distances from the different terminals to the next shunting yard are quite long—sometimes up to 40  km. That makes the transfer of containers within the SWL network quite expensive and in result the terminals are served only once a day. Due to this inefficient use of container wagons, transport times and costs for Swiss Split are increased.|$|R
30|$|The {{operation}} of the shuttle train is quite efficient {{as it is a}} full train loaded with 80 TEUs and doesn’t need any shunting processes between Rotterdam and Basel. The SWL transport includes the transfer of the wagon from the hinterland <b>terminal</b> to the <b>shunting</b> yard, the shunting process within the shunting yard, the train from the shunting yard to the regional shunting point, the shunting at the regional shunting point and the distribution and delivery of the wagons to the final recipients’ sidings. Here the trains are comparably short (10 to 30 wagons) and the sidings are served individually wagon by wagon.|$|R
30|$|The overall {{feasibility}} of the improved Swiss Split service {{was tested using}} a cost model. The authors developed railway production data to model the proposed improvements in rolling stock, terminal structure, the Swiss Split business model and SWL production improvements. For example they developed a modal-split model for the container distribution in Switzerland and assigned container flows to specific terminals. The resulting container flows were integrated into the cost model by changing the transport distances between <b>terminals</b> and <b>shunting</b> yards and by revising the average train length {{to account for the}} improved bundling of container flows. The effects of the business model improvements proposed by SBB Cargo were integrated directly into the model (improved efficiency of the wagon usage by shorter round-trip times, decreasing transhipment costs in hinterland terminals). The improvements from rolling stock, production schemes were integrated by changing the input data for the railway production processes (e.g., number of wagons per train, transport distances, shunting times etc.). The model used a three step approach to estimate the costs for the transport of one container on its entire trip.|$|R

3000|$|The {{need to be}} able to move single wagonloads {{or small}} wagonload groups (not {{necessarily}} for the same shipper or a common commodity but they could be) implies the use of train aggregation to a cost effective formation to justify the direct operational costs (train path, crew, traction, fuel, maintenance) and some form of contribution to overheads. These operations are undertaken at marshalling yards to concentrate the train and for the reciprocal dispersal of wagons at the identified receiving yard prior to final delivery. The model is well established and similar model or concept is applied in other transport sector as well, for example, maritime shipping and gives flexibility to train operators in terms of building, mixing and breaking down trains. The decision making criteria in terms of pricing, routing, manipulation in transit can vary widely and be influenced by shipper requirements (urgent transit, lower order priority) and also the railroads desire to maximise its revenue if wagons/railcars are, in the case of the U. [...].S/Canada, needed to be exchanged with other lines. Issues such as running rights and traffic exchange are well established aspects which the authors are opaque on. A recent European Commission funded (under FP 6) project [13, 12], which has been subsequently converted into a wholly commercial operation after the funding was ceased in August 2012, was based around two primary hubs for traffic aggregation and dispersal with a long haul sector over international routes using a mix of incumbent and privately owned traction and wagons and the involvement of many <b>terminal</b> and <b>shunting</b> service providers to aggregate and disperse the wagons and wagon groups. The Retrack Trains, operated by new entrant SME operator, were run to a schedule rather than building train length and weight to justify the long haul moves. Some of the Retrack trains were of very limited length as the service was developed but operated to sustain shipper confidence and also for traction and wagon balancing.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the {{transport}} processes parallel and {{perpendicular to the}} layers of p-type modulation-doped GaInNAs/GaAs multi-QW structures far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The simulation results of the steady-state predict an NDM induced by RST of hot holes in the QWs and the critical electric field of the onset of NDM to be the order of 6 kV/cm. This value agrees well with our previous experimental results. The numerically time-dependent simulations indicate that the self-generated oscillation caused by RST with the frequency in the range 20 - 50 GHz appears under the right applied electric field. The frequency of self-generated oscillation can be flexibly optimized to the range of considerable interest for applications as a simple way of generating high-frequency microwave power based on GaInNAs material system. According to our simulation, the predicted self-generated oscillation can be observed if the GaInNAs QW structure is optimized around 25 nm barrier and less than 2.4 × 1016 cm- 3 doping concentration. The current oscillation measurements will be performed using optimized structures fabricated into two <b>terminal</b> devices, and <b>shunted</b> with a 50 Ω resistor and high-speed circuit (high-speed oscilloscope and pulse generator).
