25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Insufficient oxygen {{transfer}} {{can result in}} anaerobic biofilms and odor generation during biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal in <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> and can limit ammonia oxidation in nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> Since {{oxygen transfer}} to biofilms in plastic media <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> occurs by diffusion of oxygen through thin fluid films, previous models used solutions based on penetration theory to calculate BOD removal. However, it is shown in this paper that penetration theory is not valid for typical hydraulic onditions in <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> since oxygen can diffuse through the fluid film and reach the biofilm surface. As a result, numerical solutions are required to solve the equations describing oxygen mass transport to the biofilm. Computer models are therefore {{used to calculate the}} maximum oxygen transfer during BOD and ammonia oxidation i plastic media <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> These models can be used by design engineers to minimize conditions that may cause odor generation i <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> and to provide an upper limit to the efficiency of nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{treatment}} of industrial wastewater may involve specialised tricking filters which use plastic media and high flow rates.

25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{also wanted to}} include Autonomous Republic of Adjara in the service area of UWSCG in 2010. However, this was opposed by the German state-owned development bank KfW that provided substantial funding for {{water supply and sanitation}} in Batumi on behalf of the German government. Adjara was thus excluded. In 2014 the government made a second attempt to included Adjara in the service area of the United Water Company through a decree issued by the Prime Minister, but this attempt was also foiled. De jure water and wastewater management in Adjara remains decentralized, but actually the government in Tbilisi is involved in all important decisions so that de facto it is as centralized as in other regions of Georgia. On the one hand, the Batumi water company remains financially weak, with non-revenue water as high as 90%, significant amounts of unpaid bills. As a result, tariff revenues were only 0.7 million Laris (USD 0.4m) in 2014, while operating costs stood at 10 million Laris (USD 5.7m), of which 45% were for salaries, according to an audit by the state auditor. On the other hand, there have been many notable improvements in service quality in Batumi. For example, a separate stormwater drainage system has been built, preventing flooding that had previously been frequent. 70% of customers now receive water 24 hours a day, and a modern wastewater treatment plant has been commissioned in 2012. The plant functions properly, so that the quality of coastal waters has improved substantially, benefiting tourism and making it possible to eat again locally caught fish. Both the investments costs and the energy consumption of the <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> plant are extremely low, for which the Austrian engineering company working on the plant was honored with an innovation award by the International Water Association (IWA), a professional association.|$|E
25|$|So {{far there}} is limited planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} water in Morocco, given that only 21% of the collected wastewater undergoes any treatment. In 2009 {{there were more than}} 100 wastewater treatment plants in Morocco, mostly serving small and medium-sized towns located in the interior or the country. The first wastewater treatment plants in Morocco were built by small municipalities using a wide range of technologies. Because of the limited financial and technical capacities of those municipalities practically all of these 28 plants ceased functioning shortly after they were completed. This triggered a decision in 2000 to gradually transfer the responsibility for sanitation in small and medium-sized towns to the national utility ONEP. In 2009 the latter has built or {{was in the process of}} building 43 plants, mostly using the stabilization pond technology, but also one activated sludge plant and a few <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> plants. The track record of operating these plants is better than for the plants operated by municipalities, partly because the predominant technology - stabilization ponds - does not require electricity. Its lower operating costs make it less vulnerable to disruptions in the case of strained operating budgets. In larger cities, only very few municipal utilities (Régies) operate wastewater treatment plants. Their track record at operating them is mixed: A plant operated by the Agadir utility works well, while plants operated by the utilities of Beni Mellal and Nador do not function. These plants use the activated sludge technology which requires electricity. The Marakkech utility was constructing a large plant in 2009, and the Fes utility was in the process of bidding for a plant. This process experienced a setback when the French development agency AFD and the European Investment Bank withdrew their financing for the plant, citing non-respect of tender procedures as the reason.|$|E

2500|$|Biodegradable organic {{material}} of plant or animal origin is usually possible to treat using extended conventional sewage treatment {{processes such as}} activated sludge or <b>trickling</b> <b>filter.</b> Problems can arise if the wastewater is excessively diluted with washing water or is highly [...] concentrated such as undiluted blood or milk.

2500|$|A <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> {{consists}} of a bed of rocks, gravel, slag, peat moss, or plastic media over which wastewater flows [...] downward and contacts a layer (or film) of microbial slime covering the bed media. [...] conditions are maintained [...] by forced air flowing through the bed or by natural convection of air. The process involves adsorption of organic compounds in the wastewater by the microbial slime layer, diffusion of air into the slime layer to provide the oxygen required for the biochemical oxidation of the organic compounds. The end products include carbon dioxide gas, water and other products of the oxidation. As the slime layer thickens, it becomes difficult for the air to penetrate the layer and an inner anaerobic layer is formed.|$|E

Other parameters such as suspended and settleable solids were also measured. The results obtained, when compared to results from similar pilot plant using stones as supporting medium, and with the removals predicted by classic formulas used for <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> design, indicated that this support medium may substitute with advantages, under specific conditions, the traditional support media.

40|$|Secondary {{settling}} dynamics at maximal capacity {{were investigated}} at a full scale {{wastewater treatment plant}} which utilizes a unique process solution incorporating pre-denitrification with post-nitrification in nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> Since nitrogen removal is greater when more secondary effluent is recirculated to the <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> the secondary settlers generally operate at close to their maximal capacity. The settling and flocculation properties of the activated sludge are therefore a major capacity-determining factor for plant operation. Due to the short sludge age, the flocculation properties, with respect to both thickening and clarification, can change quickly. The dynamics in these changes were studied and the factors that determine the maximal settling capacity were assessed. Solids flux curves were constructed from batch settling tests and compared with the actual maximal settling capacities...|$|R

40|$|This work {{assessed}} the behaviour of nine pharmaceuticals and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) coupled to distinct simplified post-treatment units (submerged bed, polishing ponds, and <b>trickling</b> <b>filters)</b> fed on raw sewage {{taken from a}} municipality in Brazil. The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated {{that they were not}} appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the submerged bed and polishing ponds, probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using <b>trickling</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the enantiomer-specific fate of chiral drugs during {{wastewater}} treatment and in receiving waters. Several chiral drugs were studied: amphetamine-like drugs of abuse (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA), ephedrines (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine), antidepressant venlafaxine, and beta-blocker atenolol. A monitoring program was undertaken in 7 WWTPs (utilizing mainly activated sludge and <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> technologies) and at 6 sampling points in receiving waters over the period of 9 months. The results revealed the enantiomer-specific fate of all studied drugs during both wastewater treatment and in the aqueous environment. The extent of stereoselectivity depended on several parameters including: type of chiral drug (high stereoselectivity was recorded for atenolol and MDMA), treatment technology used (activated sludge showed higher stereoselectivity than <b>trickling</b> <b>filters),</b> and season (higher stereoselectivity was observed in the aqueous environment over the spring/summer time) ...|$|R
