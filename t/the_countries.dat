In <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where {{it is not an}} official language (that is, <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> other than the UK, Ireland and Malta).

The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E
