5|$|The band {{continued}} to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum. Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was {{received as a}} boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination {{of old and new}} material. As in the past, the band was backed by a <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> playing drum tracks or a metronome in lieu of a full rhythm section.|$|E
5|$|John Richard Deacon {{was born}} in Leicester on 19 August 1951, to Arthur Henry and Lilian Molly Deacon. His younger sister, Julie, was born five years later. His father worked at the Norwich Union {{insurance}} company and in 1960 {{the family moved to}} the dormitory town of Oadby. Deacon was known to friends and his bandmates as 'Deaks' or 'Deaky' and attended Linden Junior School in Leicester, Gartree High School and Beauchamp Grammar School in Oadby. He became interested in electronics, reading magazines on the subject and building small devices, including the modification of a reel to reel <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> to record music directly off the radio. He studied well and achieved 8 GCE O level and 3 A level passes, all at grade A. He also enjoyed soul music in particular.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, a final {{special edition}} model for Japan, the SC 430 Eternal Jewel edition, was produced, limited to 200 units. The 2010 model {{was the last}} {{automobile}} from any major manufacturer in the United States to ship with a cassette <b>tape</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{automation}} systems usually {{consisted of}} 3 or 4 reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>decks,</b> playing 10.5" [...] or 14" [...] reels containing the music, and several <b>tape</b> cartridge <b>decks</b> for commercials, weather, promos, etc. The early systems were [...] "pre-computer" [...] and simply sequenced pre-selected events that were triggered by an inaudible tone. Depending on the automation supplier and {{the quantity of}} <b>tape</b> <b>decks,</b> a system would cost $18,000-$30,000.|$|R

25|$|However, {{the system}} had been {{designed}} initially for dictation and portable use, with the audio quality of early players not well suited for music. Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design. In 1971, the Advent Corporation introduced their Model 201 <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> that combined Dolby type B noise reduction and chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) tape, with a commercial-grade tape transport mechanism supplied by the Wollensak camera division of 3M Corporation. This resulted in the format being taken more seriously for musical use, and started the era of high fidelity cassettes and players.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with isopropyl alcohol, or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One of {{the concerns of the}} time however was the use of abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes actually felt rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to degauss the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or <b>tape</b> <b>deck).</b> One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E

25|$|Faced with {{a dilemma}} {{of what to}} do for a rhythm section, Mulligan decided to build on earlier {{experiments}} and perform as a pianoless quartet with Baker on trumpet, Bob Whitlock on bass and Chico Hamilton on drums (later Mulligan himself would occasionally double on piano). These early live dates were recorded by Dick Bock on a portable reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>deck.</b> Bock along with Roy Harte would soon after, start the Pacific Jazz label and release Mulligan's records. Mulligan's first recording sessions in Los Angeles were produced by Bock for Pacific Jazz. These three informal sessions took place in June, July, and August 1952 at the Hollywood Hills cottage of recording engineer Phil Turetsky. At these sessions, Mulligan, Chet Baker, and others recorded the material that was released as Pacific Jazz PJ LP-1 and later on PJ-8.|$|E
500|$|Once [...] "hypnagogic pop" [...] was coined, {{a variety}} of music blogs {{immediately}} wrote about the phenomenon. By 2010, albums by Ariel Pink and Neon Indian were regularly hailed by publications like Pitchfork and The Wire, with [...] "hypnagogic pop", [...] "chillwave", and [...] "glo-fi" [...] employed to describe the evolving sounds of such artists, a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles. As the movement's popularity grew, the analogue lo-fi aspirations of Ferraro and Pink were taken up by [...] "groups with names like <b>Tape</b> <b>Deck</b> Mountain, Memory Tapes, Memory Cassette – and turned into cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the major}} success of Flood (1990), Elektra sought out Elvis Costello to produce Apollo 18; however, John Linnell and John Flansburgh elected {{to produce the}} album {{themselves}} as they had originally planned. Prior to recording, the band upgraded many of their instruments; Flansburgh purchased a Marshall amp and Linnell bought several new saxophones. The album was recorded at The Magic Shop in New York City, in approximately ten weeks. Although the band recorded Apollo 18 primarily as a duo, its production is much less sparse when compared to previous releases. This {{is reflected in the}} fact that the album's associated tour, the Don't Tread on the Cut-Up Snake World Tour 1992, was the band's first to utilize a live backing band, rather than a <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> playing backing tracks. [...] Linnell later noted that this led to much more complicated and deliberate rehearsals.|$|E

50|$|Another {{cause of}} {{incompatibility}} between <b>tape</b> <b>decks</b> {{was the lack}} of standardisation of track widths and the use of alternate (rather than adjacent) stereo tracks by many manufacturers (which limited compatibility with mono equipment).|$|R
500|$|Kevin Renick {{wrote the}} song [...] "Up in the Air" [...] two {{years prior to}} knowing that Reitman {{was working on a}} film {{adaptation}} to the book. He had been laid off at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. [...] "The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition," [...] Renick explained. [...] "It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go." [...] He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at Webster University. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was given the song. Reitman found a <b>tape</b> <b>deck,</b> listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Cartwright is {{best known}} for her role as Bart Simpson on the long-running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. On March 13, 1987, she auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show, a sketch comedy program. Cartwright originally intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the elder daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as [...] "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [...] clever". Creator Matt Groening let her try out for Bart and gave her the job on the spot. Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters. The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting, described the sessions as [...] "great fun". However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all out and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E

500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{an attempt}} Vampire Weekend to {{distance}} themselves from the sounds featured on their debut record and Contra. [...] "Whenever we came up with something familiar sounding, it was rejected", said Rechtshaid. Pitch shifting was a major component of recording the album. For tracks such as [...] "Step", drums were recorded on a Varispeed <b>Tape</b> <b>deck</b> set to a lower speed so that they would play back faster and more high pitched. Drummer Chris Tomson would then re-record the drums playing to the sped-up recording to get an uptempo live take. This second recording was then slowed back down to original speed to create an [...] "underwater" [...] effect. The effect is featured prominently on vocals as well. Ezra Koenig's vocals were run through Eventide H949 and 910 on tracks such as [...] "Diane Young", with both the pitch and formant shifted changed to manipulate the sound of recorded vocals. Bass guitar was also recorded straight to tape [...] "with a fairly ambient miking approach where the mic was three feet away from the cabinet". Vocals were recorded with Soundelux U99 Microphones, in combination with 1176 Classic limiter plug-in, Fairchild 670 Compressor and Elektro-Mess-Technik 140 Plate Reverb, giving the vocals a quality Batmanglij described as [...] "buttery". For guitar sounds, Batmanglij chose not to mic his guitar and instead plugged his Les Paul direct-in to ProTools through a SansAmp Amp Emulation Pedal, a technique used by Jimmy Page.|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E
2500|$|The band went {{overboard}} with experimentation, with Erikson {{adding that}} throughout {{they liked to}} include [...] "sounds that we found accidentally, like Steve's sample of a <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> backing up, or the bit in 'Stupid Girl' that was initially a mistake, but when we slowed it down, actually fit the timbre and pace of the song and became the hook." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1982 {{the album}} was re-released on vinyl, and in 1987 on compact disc by E.G. Records. Modern {{reception}} has been mostly positive. Ted Mills of the music database AllMusic gave the album {{four and a half}} stars out of five, praising the track [...] "Heavenly Music Corporation," [...] noting [...] "the beauty" [...] of their <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> setup, yet giving a negative view of [...] "Swastika Girls" [...] suggesting that the loop system was abused with [...] "too many disconnected sounds sharing the space, some discordant, some melodic... the resulting work lacks form and structure". Eric Tamm, the author of the Eno biography Brian Eno: His Music and the Vertical Color of Sound (1995) reacted similarly to Mills, stating that [...] "The Heavenly Music Corporation" [...] "anticipated Eno's own ambient style."
