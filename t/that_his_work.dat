5|$|Tippett {{resolved}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> {{would be}} an oratorio rather than an opera. He chose the title from Ein Kind unserer Zeit, a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer, Ödön von Horváth.|$|E
5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
50|$|Park himself insists <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are not racist, but a satiric {{commentary}} on current events and against political correctness in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about {{freedom of speech}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> case and <b>works</b> have generated, especially in Denmark, where <b>his</b> <b>works</b> have been exhibited in the Parliament building.|$|R
50|$|Ondrusch {{presented}} <b>his</b> <b>works</b> at annual {{exhibitions in}} Gleiwitz; Hindenburg; and Oppeln. It is reported <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> {{can be found}} in Oldenburg, Eschershausen and Wiesbaden as well as in private collections.|$|R

5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Horne resumed working at Triplex, and was promoted {{to the position of}} sales director. Despite his subsequent joint career in broadcasting and business, his commercial activities always took precedence. He declared <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on radio was only a hobby, and that he would give it up before his business career. He combined his two roles by working full-time, and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends.|$|E
5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989. Elfman noted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on Planet of the Apes contained more percussion instruments than usual.|$|E
5|$|Gregory's work {{received}} little scholarly {{attention in the}} West until the mid-twentieth century, and he was historically treated as a minor figure in comparison to Basil the Great or Gregory of Nazianzus. As late as 1942, Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> was virtually unknown. In {{part due to the}} scholarship of Balthasar and Jean Daniélou, by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research, with a critical edition of his work published (Gregorii Nysseni Opera), and the founding of the International Colloquium on Gregory of Nyssa. This attention has continued to the present day. Modern studies have mainly focused on Gregory's eschatology rather than his more dogmatic writings, and he has gained a reputation as an unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism. Major figures in contemporary research include Sarah Coakley, John Zizioulas and Robert Jenson.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a {{tour that}} was to mend {{relations}} after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated. The Australians won 2–1, and Woodfull remains the only first captain to regain the Ashes twice. Woodfull was criticised for adopting excessively cautious tactics after the advent of bodyline. Woodfull retired after the tour; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket. The British king offered Woodfull a knighthood for his services to cricket, and in reference to his actions during the bodyline series, but Woodfull declined, stating <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as a teacher was {{far more important than}} cricket. A mathematics teacher, Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater, Melbourne High School.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas' doctrine {{has been described as}} an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were preclassical in style, he was highly {{regarded}} as a composer in the 1780s, especially for <b>his</b> symphonies <b>that</b> follow the model of Mannheim school.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>work</b> {{grows out}} of the {{tradition}} of Alexander Calder and George Rickey, but in a recent review the critic Grace Glueck stated <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work's</b> 'gently assertive character is very much <b>his</b> own.' <b>His</b> <b>works</b> are {{on display at the}} Maxwell Davidson Gallery in New York City.|$|R

5|$|In September 2013, Farrands {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a second documentary film on the Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by Bracke's book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In making such a film, Farrands turned to Bracke's book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its structure and content. Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of Friday the 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|E
5|$|The History of Ferdinand and Isabella was {{published}} on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, Boston, with a print run of 500copies. It {{was dedicated to}} his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston's bookshops, let alone the whole nation's. It {{was first published in}} London by Richard Bentley in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where Henry Vassall-Fox and Robert Southey expressed their admiration of the work. It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time. Prescott was adamant <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the original project's cancellation. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in May 1839.|$|E

50|$|One of Serly's {{most famous}} {{original}} works is Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra. <b>His</b> <b>work</b> bringing Bartók's work to fruition {{has paid off}} in the sense <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are often paired with those of his better known teacher, on recordings and in live performance.|$|R
25|$|Many of Zaichū’s {{paintings}} were stored in prominent Kyoto temples frequented mainly by the nobility. As a result, <b>his</b> <b>works</b> {{were not available}} to the public, which some argue has negatively affected his reputation. In addition to despairing of Zaichū’s works’ “blandness,” some modern critics have challenged his status as an important artist, arguing <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are essentially imitations of older Chinese and Japanese paintings rather than original, creative pieces. Others acknowledge his use of prototypes, but suggest <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> demonstrate a “characteristic Japanese dynamism.” Zaichū, for the record, acknowledged his indebtedness to existing works: on some paintings, instead of signing his name, he wrote captions identifying the pieces as ‘copies’ or as being ‘after’ a given artist.|$|R
60|$|THIRD. Observe. Every believer {{should not}} only take heed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> be good, and so for the present do them, but should {{carefully}} study to maintain them; that is, to keep in a continual exercise of them.|$|R
25|$|In November, 1999, the Kenyan {{government}} {{tried to}} deport Fr. Kaiser, claiming <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> permit had expired. Kaiser briefly went into hiding in Kisii before he was granted a new work permit, but only after intervention by the US Ambassador Johnnie Carson and Bishop Colin Davis of Ngong.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s Turing {{is convicted}} of indecency and, {{in lieu of}} a jail sentence, {{undergoes}} chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> saved millions of lives.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 Krishnamurti fell in {{love with}} Helen Knothe, a 17-year-old American whose family {{associated}} with the Theosophists. The experience was tempered by the realisation <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> and expected life-mission precluded what would otherwise be considered normal relationships and by the mid-1920s {{the two of them had}} drifted apart.|$|E
50|$|The critic Jeffrey Kastner {{has noted}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> locate ‘startling beauty in their {{counterintuitive}} material juxtapositions.’ However, for Jackson beauty is frequently partnered by desolation. <b>His</b> <b>work</b> explores {{a concept that}} he terms ‘the Horriful’, the belief that everything one does {{has the potential to}} bring both beauty and horror.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} V. Shnirelman, [...] "it {{is curious}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were re-published in Azerbaijan {{in the early}} 1990s and received wide popularity there". Velichko's [...] "forgotten racist tract" [...] was reissued by Ziya Bunyadov's academy.|$|R

25|$|In 1927, the Chicago Tribune sent Seldes to Mexico, but his {{articles}} criticizing American corporations {{for their}} use of that country's mineral rights were not well received. Seldes returned to Europe, but found <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> increasingly censored to fit the political views of the newspaper's owner, Robert R. McCormick.|$|E
25|$|Povenmire was {{initially}} worried <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on Family Guy (an adult show {{known for its}} lowbrow humor) would concern Disney, which markets primarily towards families. However, the Disney Channel's Senior Vice President of Original Series, Adam Bonnett, was a Family Guy fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received his pitch well.|$|E
25|$|In a {{surprise}} reveal at the ending, a bearded, much older looking Eddie is shown alive, watching the ending credits of Foley's documentary tribute {{to him and}} the band roll {{through the window of}} an appliance store. He smiles serenely, proud to know <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> is finally being heard, and then disappears into the night.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> {{raise the question of}} what is real, what is a real cowboy, and what makes it so. Prince's photographs of these advertisements attempt to prompt one to decide how real are media images.|$|R
25|$|The {{content of}} Palahniuk's works has {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} as a nihilist. Palahniuk has rejected this label, stating that he is a romantic, and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are mistakenly seen as nihilistic because they express ideas that others do not believe in.|$|R
5000|$|Caesarius complained, in <b>his</b> writings, <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> {{were taken}} out of his hand, {{unfinished}} and uncorrected.
