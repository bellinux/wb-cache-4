40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} metabolic and respiratory inhibitors on the gliding motility of Flexibacter polymorphus were examined. Motility and oxygen consumption were quantitatively inhibited in a reversible manner by specific respiratory poisons, suggesting that gliding velocity {{was linked to}} electron transport activity. Arsenate had little influence on the number or rate of gliding filaments, despite a 95 % decrease in the concentration of intracellular adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP). At concentrations of cyanide or azide that abolished gliding movement, cells possessed a level of ATP {{that should have been}} sufficient to allow motility. Proton-conducting uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, such as carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide,</b> strongly inhibited locomotion yet did not suppress respiratory activity or intracellular ATP sufficiently to account for their effect on movement. Inhibition of motility by CCCP (but not by <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide)</b> was partially reversed by sulfhydryl compounds. However, unlike CCCP, inhibition of motility by p-chloromercuribenzoate, a known sulfhydryl-blocking reagent, was associated with a corresponding reduction in respiratory activity and ATP content of cells. Protein synthesis was not blocked by concentrations of CCCP inhibitory for motility, indicating that utilization of existing ATP in this energy-requiring process was not impaired. These data suggest (but do not unequivocally prove) that ATP may not function as the sole energy donor for the gliding mechanism, but that some additional product of electron transport is required (e. g., the intermediate of oxidative phosphorylation) ...|$|E

N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the proton-translocating ATPase in M. barkeri, did not affect proton extrusion.

The accumulation was abolished by carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide,</b> 2, 4 dinitrophenol, and other uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation even though oxidative phosphorylation {{would not be}} expected to occur anaerobically. In the presence of the uncouplers, the β-galactoside carrier remained functional and catalyzed equilibration of thiomethylgalactoside across the membrane. The uncouplers did not inhibit the generation of adenosine triphosphate or protein turnover, or the accumulation of α-methylglucoside and glycerol by phosphorylation. We conclude that, at least anaerobically, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation do not interfere with energy metabolism in general, but prevent the utilization of metabolic energy for the active transport of galactosides. The uncouplers also facilitate passage of protons across the membrane. Various hypotheses are considered to explain why a proton-impermeable membrane may be required for active transport of galactosides and other substrates...|$|E

A guinea pig assay procedure is described which measures the photosensitizing potential of topical germicides.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{compounds}} that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation on membrane function in Streptoccocus faecalis, an organism which relies upon glycolysis for the generation of metabolic energy. At low concentrations (ranging from 10 − 7 to 10 − 4 m), <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide,</b> tetramethyldipicrylamine, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, pentachlorophenol, and dicoumarol strongly inhibited energy-dependent transport of rubidium, phosphate, and certain amino acids. However, these compounds {{had little effect on}} the generation of adenosine triphosphate via glycolysis or on its utilization for the synthesis of macromolecules. They also did not seriously inhibit uptake of those monosaccharides and amino acids which do not require concurrent metabolism. It is proposed that the uncouplers interfere with the utilization of metabolic energy for membrane transport. The uncouplers accelerated the translocation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. It appears that a proton-impermeable membrane is required for transport, perhaps, because a proton gradient is involved in the coupling of metabolic energy to the translocation of substrates across the membrane...|$|E

The reaction was successfully transferred to syngeneic mice by injecting them with lymph node cells from sensitized donors, a finding that demonstrates the immunologic nature of PHS. The presence of UVB (280 – 320 nm) radiation was not necessary for sensitization and did not increase PHS beyond the levels observed with UVA radiation alone. Ultraviolet radiation in the UVB range (plus {{a small amount of}} UVA radiation) from FS 40 sunlamps in the dose employed did not induce statistically significant PHS to TCSA, nor did it elicit a significant response in mice sensitized with TCSA plus UVA radiation.

Proton-conducting uncouplers (<b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) inhibited galactose uptake by the permease system, but had no effect on phosphotransferase activity. Inhibition and efflux experiments conducted using beta-galactoside analogs showed that the galactose permease had a high affinity for galactose, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, but possessed little or no affinity for glucose and lactose. The spatial configurations of hydroxyl groups at C- 2, C- 4, and C- 6 were structurally important in facilitating interaction between the carrier and the sugar analog. Iodoacetate had no inhibitory effect on accumulation of galactose, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, or lactose via the phosphotransferase system. However, after exposure of the cells to p-chloromercuribenzoate, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent uptake of lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside were reduced by 75 and 100 %, respectively, whereas galactose phosphotransferase activity remained unchanged. The independent kinetic analysis of each transport system was achieved by the selective generation of the appropriate energy source (adenosine 5 '-triphosphate or phosphoenolpyruvate) in vivo. The maximum rates of galactose transport by the two systems were similar, but the permease system exhibited a 10 -fold greater affinity for sugar than did the phosphotransferase system...|$|E

Phosphotransferase (PTS) activity, identified as phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, {{was found in}} cell extracts but could not be demonstrated in cells permeabilized with toluene when assays were conducted at pH 6. 6. The same was true for mannitol and fructose phosphotransferase activities. Cells grown on fructose accumulated glucose at a slower rate than glucose-grown cells, and extracts prepared from them did not contain glucose PTS activity. Examination {{of the effects of}} analogs on glucose uptake and phosphorylation showed that 2 -deoxyglucose was not a PTS substrate, but did markedly inhibit glucose uptake, with stronger inhibition in cells grown on fructose. Glucose accumulation by whole cells grown on glucose became less sensitive to the uncoupler <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> (TCS) as the pH was raised from 6. 6 to 8. 0, while in fructose-grown cells TCS was equally effective across this pH range. PTS activity was exhibited by toluene-treated cells at pH 7. 5 and above, although the system itself in extracts was not affected by pH in the range of 5. 0 to 8. 0. The results are consistent with the presence of two glucose transport systems, one a PTS and the other operating by an alternative mechanisms, and suggest that the PTS in B. licheniformis may be regulated in a pH-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Methanogenesis from {{methanol}} by cell suspensions of Methanosarcina barkeri was inhibited by the uncoupler <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide.</b> This inhibition {{was reversed}} {{by the addition}} of formaldehyde. 14 C labeling experiments revealed that methanol served exclusively as the electron acceptor, whereas formaldehyde was mainly oxidized to CO 2 under these conditions. These data support the hypothesis (M. Blaut and G. Gottschalk, Eur. J. Biochem. 141 : 217 - 222, 1984) that the first step in methanol oxidation depends on the proton motive force or a product thereof. Cell extracts of M. barkeri converted methanol and formaldehyde to methane under an H 2 atmosphere. Under an N 2 atmosphere, however, formaldehyde was disproportionated to CH 4 and CO 2, whereas methanol was metabolized to a very small extent only, irrespective of the presence of ATP. It was concluded that cell extracts of M. barkeri are not able to oxidize methanol. In further experiments, the sodium dependence of methanogenesis and ATP formation by whole cells was investigated. Methane formation from methanol alone and the corresponding increase in the intracellular ATP content were strictly dependent on Na+. If, in contrast, methanol was utilized together with H 2, methane and ATP were synthesized in the absence of Na+. The same is true for the disproportionation of formaldehyde to methane and carbon dioxide. From these experiments, it is concluded that in M. barkeri, Na+ is involved not in the process of ATP synthesis but in the first step of methanol oxidation...|$|E

The transport system displayed low-affinity Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics. Using galactose or arginine as energy sources, similar V max and K m values for AIB entry were obtained, but on prolonged incubation the intracellular steady-state concentration of AIB in cells metabolizing arginine was only 65 to 70 % that attained by glycolyzing cells. Efflux of AIB FROM PRELOADED CElls was temperature dependent and exhibited {{the characteristics of}} a first-order reaction. The rate of AIB exit was accelerated two- to threefold in the presence of metabolizable energy sources. Metabolic inhibitors including p-chloromercuribenzoate, dinitrophenol, azide, arsentate, and N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide either prevented or greatly reduced AIB uptake. Fluoride, iodoacetate and N-ethylmaleimide abolished galactose-dependent, but not arginine-energized, AIB uptake. K+ and Rb+ reduced the steady-state intracellular AIB concentration by approximately 40 %, and these cations also induced rapid efflux of solute from actively transporting cells. Equivalent concentrations (10 mM) of Na+, Li+, or NH 4 + were much less inhibitory. The proton-conducting ionophores <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenlyhydrazone abolished uptake and induced AIB efflux even though glycolysis and arginine catabolism continued at 60 and 140 %, respectively, of control rates.

Ionophores and inhibitors of bacterial energy metabolism {{were added to}} mixed rumen bacteria prepared from sheep receiving grass hay plus concentrate diets, and their influence on the rate of metabolism of alanine (Ala) peptides was determined. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) had no influence on the rate of breakdown of Ala 2, Ala 3, Ala 4 or Ala 5, indicating that the metabolism of these peptides did not require ATP. The protonophores <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> (TCS) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) inhibited peptide breakdown to a minor extent (< 15 %), whereas the ionophores monensin and tetronasin had greater, but still small (12 ? 31 %), inhibitory effects. Toluene stimulated peptide breakdown, consistent with a permeability barrier having been removed. Thus, at least some peptide metabolism depends on transport into bacteria; transport appears not to be ATP-linked, and may well be coupled to the uptake of mineral cations rather than protons. Rumen fluid from sheep receiving a similar diet with added monensin (33 mg/kg) or tetronasin (10 mg/kg) hydrolysed Ala 3 and Ala 4 at rates that {{did not differ significantly}} from controls. Nevertheless, the peak concentration of free peptides in rumen fluid after feeding was more than doubled in ionophore-fed sheep, and peptides persisted for longer than in control animals.

B 1 was {{governed by a}} permease which did not catalyze concomitant substrate transport and phosphorylation and thus was not a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase. Glucose uptake was carrier mediated, could not be driven by an artificial membrane potential (Δψ) in {{the presence or absence}} of sodium, and was not sensitive to inhibitors which dissipate the proton motive force (Δp; <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide,</b> N,N-dicyclohexylcarboiimide, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol), and no uptake of the nonmetabolizable analog 2 -deoxyglucose could be demonstrated. The glucokinase apparent Km for glucose (0. 21 mM) was similar to the Kt (affinity constant) for glucose uptake (0. 15 mM), suggesting that glucokinase controls the rate of glucose uptake. Inhibitors of ATP synthesis (iodoacetate and sodium fluoride) also inhibited glucose uptake, and this effect was due to a reduction in the level of ATP available to glucokinase for glucose phosphorylation. These results indicated that T. thermosulfuricus Rt 8. B 1 lacks a concentrative uptake system for glucose and that uptake is via facilitated diffusion, followed by ATP-dependent phosphorylation by glucokinase. In T. thermosulfuricus Rt 8. B 1, glucose is metabolized by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, which yields 2 mol of ATP (G. M. Cook, unpublished data). Since only 1 mol of ATP is used to transport 1 mol of glucose, the energetics of this system are therefore similar to those found in bacteria which possess a phosphotransferase...|$|E

Adhesion of R. flavefaciens was unaffected by high concentrations of sugars (5 %), temperature, pH, oxygen, metabolic inhibitors, and lack of Na+. In contrast, the attachment was affected by the removal of divalent cations (Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +), the presence of cellulose derivatives (methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose), and cystine. Adhesion of F. succinogenes was sensitive to low and high temperatures, high concentrations of glucose and cellobiose (5 %), hydroxyethylcellulose (0. 1 %), redox potential, pH, lack of monovalent cations, and the presence of an inhibitor of membrane ATPases or lasalocid and monensin.

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether ion currents help to localize {{growth and development}} of Blastocladiella emersonii, we grew the organisms in gradients of various ionophores and inhibitors. Gradients were generated by placing into the culture fine glass fibers coated with insoluble inhibitors; in some cases, inhibitors were adsorbed onto beads of ion-exchange resin. Organisms growing {{in many of these}} gradients exhibited a striking tendency for the thalli to grow toward the fiber. This proved to be misleading; the cells grew not toward the source of the ionophore but into the unoccupied zone of inhibition adjacent to the fiber. Fibers coated with gramicidin-D induced marked effects on the growth of the rhizoids, which were greatly enlarged and grew toward and onto the fiber. None of the other inhibitors produced such effects, except for beads coated with the proton conductors <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> and compound 1799. The results suggest that orientation of rhizoid growth results from enhancement of proton flux across the plasma membrane. Growth of the rhizoids was also strongly oriented by gradients of inorganic phosphate and an amino acid mixture; gradients of glucose, K+, Ca 2 +, and glutamate were ineffective. We propose that a major physiological function of the rhizoid is to transport nutrients to the thallus. Finally, we examined the effects of a series of benzimidazole antitubulins as well as the cytochalasins. These did not orient growth but grossly perturbed the pattern of cellular organization, producing small spherical cells with multiple stunted rhizoids. The findings are interpreted in terms of the interaction of an endogenous transcellular proton current with elements of the cytoskeleton in the determination of form...|$|E

Cultured LC-EC were photohapten-modified in vitro by irradiation in TCSA-containing medium using a 1000 -watt solar simulator equipped with filters to deliver primarily UVA radiation (320 – 400 nm). Lymphocytes from TCSA-photosensitized mice were incubated with LC-EC that had been treated in vitro with 0. 1 mM TCSA and 2 J/cm 2 UVA radiation (TCSA + UVA). Responder lymphocytes demonstrated a significant increase in their blastogenesis response compared to lymphocytes that were incubated with LC-EC irradiated with UVA prior to treatment with TCSA (UVA/TCSA) or with LC-EC that had received no treatment. Lymphocytes from naive mice or mice photosensitized with musk ambrette (MA) demonstrated a significantly lower response to LC-EC modified with TCSA + UVA, indicating the specificity of the response. Maximum blastogenesis response was achieved when LC-EC were treated with 0. 1 mM TCSA and a UVA radiation dose of at least 0. 5 J/cm 2. Epidermal cells depleted of LC by treatment with anti-Ia antibody plus complement or by an adherence procedure were unable to stimulate this blastogenesis response. Epidermal cells treated in vitro with TOSA + UVA demonstrated enhanced fluorescence compared to control cells. The fluorescence observed was not restricted to any specific epidermal cell type; however, fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that dendritic Ia-positive cells, presumably LC, were also TCSA fluorescent. Flow cytometry showed that Ia-positive epidermal cells demonstrated the greatest UV fluorescence when treated with TCSA + UVA compared, to both cells irradiated with UVA and subsequently treated with TCSA and untreated cells. This is consistent with the enhanced antigen presentation capability of TCSA + UVA treated LC-EC, which leads to the conclusion that LC photohapten-modified in vitro with TCSA + UVA demonstrate enhanced TCSA fluorescence and are capable of stimulating lymphocytes from TCSA photosensitized mice in an antigen-specific manner...|$|E

Starved cells maintained the capacity for TMG uptake for many hours, and accumulation of the beta-galactoside was insensitive to proton-conducting ionophores (<b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide</b> and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) and sulfydryl group reagents including iodoacetate and N-ethylmaleimide. Fluorimetric analysis of glycolytic intermediates in extracts prepared from starved cells revealed (a) high intracellular levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (13 mM; PEP) and 2 -phosphoglycerate (approximately 39 mM; 2 -PG), but an absence of other metabolites including glucose 6 -phosphate, fructose 6 -phosphate, fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate, and triosephosphates. The following criteria showed PEP (and 2 -PG) to be the endogenous energy source for TMG accumulation by the phosphotransferase system: the intracellular concentrations of PEP and 2 -PG decreased with concomitant uptake of TMG, and a close correlation was observed between maximum accumulation of the beta-galactoside and the total available concentration of the two intermediates; TMG accumulated as an anionic derivative, which after extraction and incubation with alkaline phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1) formed the original analogue; fluoride inhibition of 2 -phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase (EC 4. 2. 1. 11) prevented the conversion of 2 -PG to PEP, and uptake of TMG by the starved cells was reduced by 80 %; and the stoichiometric ratio [TMG] accumulated/[PEP] consumed was almost unity (0. 93). In cells metabolizing glucose, all intermediates listed in (a) and (b) were found. Upon exhaustion of glucose from the medium, the metabolites in (b) were not longer detectable, while the intracellular concentrations of PEP and 2 -PG increased to the levels previously observed in starved cells.

This uptake ratio was essentially constant {{over a wide range}} of probe and sperm concentrations. Discharge of the pH gradient with specific ionophores (nigericin, monensin, and <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide)</b> or nonspecifically using low concentration of detergents (Triton X- 100 and lysolecithin) all resulted in the release of the probes indicating they are indeed sensing the pH gradient across the sperm membrane. Addition of Na+ to sperm suspended in Na+- free sea water resulted in activation of motility with concomitant efflux of the probes indicating the alkalinization of pH(i) by 0. 4 - 0. 5 pH units. That this pH(i) change is the causal trigger of motility was suggested by experiments using NH 4 Cl and nigericin, which increased the pH(i) and resulted in activation of motility in the absence of Na+. When sperm were directly diluted into artificial sea water (motility activated), a slow reacidification of pH(i) was observed in one species of sea urchin (L. pictus) but not in the other (S. purpuratus). This acidification could be blocked by mitochondrial inhibitors, verapamil, or the removal of external calcium suggesting that the increase in metabolic activity stimulated by the influx of Ca 2 + is responsible for the reacidification. Induction of acrosome reaction further alkalinized the pH(i) by about 0. 16 pH units and was also followed by prolonged reacidification which correlated with the observed increase in Ca 2 + uptake. Either mitochondrial agents or the removal of external Ca 2 + could also block this pH(i) change suggesting a similar mechanism is involved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Proton translocation was not observed if either the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or the respiratory inhibitor 2 -n-heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline N-oxide was present. When spheroplasts oxidized Diquat radical (DQ+) to the oxidized species (DQ++) with nitrate as acceptor, nitrate was reduced to nitrite according to the reaction: [Formula: see text] and nitrite was further reduced in the reaction: [Formula: see text] Nitrite reductase activity (2) was inhibited by CO, leaving nitrate reductase activity (1) unaffected. Benzyl Viologen radical (BV+) is able to cross the cytoplasmic membrane and is oxidized directly by nitrate reductase to the divalent cation, BV++. In the presence of CO, this reaction consumes two protons: [Formula: see text] The consumption of these protons could not be detected by a pH electrode in the extra-cellular bulk phase of a suspension of spheroplasts unless the cytoplasmic membrane was made permeable to protons {{by the addition of}} nigericin or <b>tetrachlorosalicylanilide.</b> It is concluded that the protons of eqn.

Diquat radical, reduced N-methylphenazonium methosulphate and its sulphonated analogue N-methylphenazonium- 3 -sulphonate (PMSH) and ubiquinol 1 are all oxidized by nitrate reductase via a haem-dependent, endogenous quinone-independent, 2 -n-heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline N-oxide-sensitive pathway. Approximate→H+/ 2 e− stoichiometries were zero with Diquat radical, an electron donor, 1. 0 with reduced N-methylphenazonium methosulphate or its sulphonated analogue, both hydride donors, and 2. 0 with ubiquinol 1 (QH 2), a hydrogen donor. It is concluded that the protons appearing in the medium are derived from the reductant and the observed→H+/ 2 e− stoichiometries are accounted for by the following reactions occurring at the periplasmic aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane. : [Formula: see text...|$|E
