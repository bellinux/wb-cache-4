5|$|Bell's retrial in the Barker {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} for December 6. Three days before the trial began, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.|$|E
5|$|The most {{powerful}} Mafia boss in Gotham, who shares a prison cell with Joe Chill after Chill murdered Bruce's parents and later, after having Chill murdered for his decision <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> their relationship, goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul by smuggling in Crane's fear toxins through his drug shipments {{over the course}} of several months so that they can be mixed in with the city's water supply.|$|E
5|$|After {{a costly}} legal battle over {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become hesitant <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E
50|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a woman (Lola Falana) who is {{released}} from jail for 24 hours prior <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> her ex-boyfriend, played by James A. Watson Jr.|$|R
50|$|Also, in the film, Calvin {{was killed}} by Rico in {{retaliation}} for shooting Ace. Kevin Clark, the man who inspired the character Calvin, was not killed for the crime, rather turned himself in to a local police station along with his companions. Azie admitted <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> Kevin, and all three men were sentenced to 112 years in prison.|$|R
50|$|In Kuwait, Article 182 {{states that}} {{persecution}} will be dropped {{in cases of}} sexual assault, if the assailant married the woman, {{with the permission of}} a guardian. In Afghanistan, Article 26 was adopted as recent as 2014, which provided a ban on relatives of an accused person <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> them. Though this does not specifically effect rape or marriage, there has been cases in which this was the outcome.|$|R
5|$|Fastow and his wife, Lea, both {{pleaded guilty}} to charges against them. Fastow was {{initially}} charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes. Fastow {{pleaded guilty to}} two charges of conspiracy {{and was sentenced to}} ten years with no parole in a plea bargain <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.|$|E
5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He testified at the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what he felt was undue influence by the CIA and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during {{the debate over the}} Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse wanted to call Shoup <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E
5000|$|Blackburn {{has argued}} that the Fifth Amendment {{protection}} from individuals being compelled <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> themselves does not apply to testimony which is required to decrypt a protected data source in order to provide prosecutors with evidence. He suggests that the convenience of prosecutors in acquiring evidence in this manner overrules the otherwise inalienable right to avoid being [...] "compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself".|$|R
50|$|Supervisors of the Defensive Division. They get Georges {{at the end}} <b>to</b> {{make him}} <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Robert Duval and Charles Maistre.|$|R
6000|$|... "Could you {{not just}} let them have a few drawings, or {{a little bit of}} your company work--just enough for you not to annoy every one, and seem <b>to</b> be <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> them? You would not like to vex Meta." ...|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is horrified when the witness who was due <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the Morley cigarette company dies mysteriously. After being called into assist, Mulder and Scully soon discover that a new brand of cigarette has a dangerous secret.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004 Massino {{was convicted}} in a murder and {{racketeering}} indictment based on the testimony of several cooperating made men, including Massino's disgruntled underboss and brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale. He was also facing the death penalty if convicted in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year, but after agreeing <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> his former associates {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005. Massino testified twice for the government, helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013, though he will be on supervised release {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|Charlotte Karin Lindström, Swedish waitress/model who {{attempted}} to hire a hitman <b>to</b> kill persons <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> her boyfriend in a drug trial in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The {{theoretical}} work {{based on}} the prisoner's dilemma is one reason why, in many countries, plea bargaining is forbidden. Often, precisely the prisoner's dilemma scenario applies: {{it is in the}} interest of both suspects <b>to</b> confess and <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the other suspect, irrespective of the innocence of the accused. Arguably, the worst case is when only one party is guilty—here, the innocent one is unlikely to confess, while the guilty one is likely <b>to</b> confess and <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the innocent.|$|R
50|$|Banev {{said that}} he was invited in writing to a meeting with the Interior Minister, Rumen Petkov, who {{requested}} Brendo’s assistance - i.e. <b>to</b> falsely <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> “the Margin” brothers. According to Banev, his refusal to cooperate with the Minister is the main reason behind the 2007 charges for money laundering against him.|$|R
5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge {{of the planning}} of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten {{and a half years of}} his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.|$|E
5|$|Raya, a young Ukrainian woman, and {{her friend}} Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of human trafficking. While {{investigating}} their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale sexual slavery ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid {{to proceed with the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, {{the right to a}}n information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and the right to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, Ryan gave an inscribed gold keychain to Las Vegas mobster Davie Berman that read, [...] "DB from Ray Ryan, 1949." [...] Yet in the 1960s Ryan was {{reported}} <b>to</b> have <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> the mob in an FBI case, {{a factor that}} could have been linked to his eventual murder in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|On November 13, 1992, Charles [...] "Cal" [...] Levy, {{a former}} {{marketing}} director for the Reds, stated in a deposition for Tim Sabo, a former employee who was suing the team, that he'd heard Schott refer to then-Reds outfielders Eric Davis and Dave Parker as [...] "million-dollar niggers." [...] Sabo, whose position was [...] "team controller," [...] alleged that his 1991 firing was due <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> Schott in another lawsuit brought against Schott by several limited partners and because he opposed the unwritten policy of not hiring blacks. Schott's countersuit alleged that Sabo wrote unauthorized checks to himself and paid health insurance premiums to retired front-office employees. She asked for $25,000 in damages for defamation. Sabo ultimately lost his suit.|$|R
25|$|On {{the day of}} {{his death}} he was <b>to</b> have <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Anastasia, a {{high-ranking}} member of the Cosa Nostra, and the trial was based solely on Reles' testimony. Frank Costello reportedly raised $100,000 to bribe these guards to kill Reles. It is alleged that Charles Burns, one of the police bodyguards, was also involved in the disappearance of Judge Joseph Force Crater in 1930.|$|R
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right {{and that the government}} will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|When Romero's {{committee}} intensifies its investigation, Underwood {{tries to}} divert their attention by ordering troops into Syria on {{the pretense of}} preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
60|$|Continue <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> boldly <b>against</b> realism. Down with Dagon, {{the fish}} god! All art swings down towards imitation, in these days, fatally. But {{the man who}} loves art with wisdom sees the joke; it is the lustful that tremble and respect her ladyship; but the honest and romantic lovers of the Muse can see a joke and sit down to laugh with Apollo.|$|R
50|$|Holtzman v. Hellenbrand {{was a case}} in New York {{concerning}} the admissibility of a prior statement by a person who later refused <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in court. American law assures a defendant an opportunity <b>to</b> confront people <b>testifying</b> <b>against</b> them (so the prior statement would only be someone's hearsay statement), but prohibits a person from profiting by their wrong doing so should {{not be able to}} avoid the statement if they criminally induced the person <b>to</b> not <b>testify</b> in court.|$|R
5000|$|In 1943, Krupa {{was arrested}} for {{possession}} of two marijuana cigarettes and was given a 90-day jail sentence, of which he served 84 days. He was also charged with, but acquitted of, contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was exonerated/acquitted of all charges when it was subsequently proven that the entire episode was a trumped-up [...] "frame", as the prosecution's key witness had been paid <b>to</b> falsely <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Krupa.|$|R
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan T. Leete had captained the {{schooner}} Reaper, {{owned by}} James Frisbie, and crewed {{by a man}} of East Asian origin, John Canoe, commonly known as Jackalow, short for John Low or John Lord. After Jonathan gave up command of the Reaper, he and Jackalow worked on Jonathan's father's farm on Sachem's Head in Guilford, Connecticut, where Jackalow was regarded as family. At some point, while in New York, Jackalow had stolen $100 from Jonathan and fled to New Haven. He was returned to New York by the police, but Jonathan refused <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him and rehired him. Jonathan and his brother Elijah J. Leete subsequently bought the 30-ton sloop Spray, {{funded in part by}} a mortgage their father took out on his farm. Jonathan (the captain), Elijah, and Jackalow sailed the Spray together for two or three years. By March 1860, Jackalow had sailed with Jonathan for four years.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E
50|$|On appeal, however, Adamson's {{attorney}} Morris Lavine {{argued that}} Adamson's freedom against self-incrimination {{guaranteed by the}} Fifth Amendment had been violated. He argued that because the prosecutor had drawn attention to Adamson's refusal <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> his freedom <b>against</b> self-incrimination had been violated.|$|R
50|$|A further motif is anarchism. Narrator Clive Lean seems unmoved by society's laws, and {{continually}} breaks them. He evades income tax by selling his company to a tramp, takes {{some of the}} world's first designer drugs, steals Berengaria's body and her documents from the Church of England, handcuffs a priest to a parking sign, drives a getaway car, knocks a policemen {{to the ground in}} resisting arrest, and bribes a witness <b>to</b> not <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|Funk prosecuted former U.S. Marshall John T Ambrose for leaking {{information}} to mob figures about {{the location of}} a protected witness. It was the first case of its type for a U.S Marshal violating the security of the Witness Protection Program. Ambrose was assigned to guard Nicholas Calabrese, the first [...] "made" [...] member <b>to</b> ever <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the Chicago outfit. Ambrose was charged and later convicted with leaking information about Calabrese to other mob figures.|$|R
