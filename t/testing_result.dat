40|$|Spectrum-based fault {{localization}} (SBFL) {{has been}} widely studied due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, it still has some challenging problems. The application of SBFL {{in the absence of}} test oracle and the selection of the most effective risk evaluation formulas are amongst the most critical problems. In this thesis, we are going to address these two problems. Currently, all existing SBFL techniques have assumed the existence of a test oracle. Otherwise, the program spectrum will not be associated with the <b>testing</b> <b>result</b> of failed or passed, and as a consequence, there will be insufficient information to perform the risk evaluation. However, in many real-world applications, it is very common that test oracles do not exist, and hence SBFL cannot be applied in such situations. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose a novel concept of metamorphic slice resulted from the integration of metamorphic testing and program slicing, to alleviate the oracle problem for SBFL. In our approach, instead of using the program slice and the <b>testing</b> <b>result</b> of failed or passed for an individual test case, metamorphic slice and the <b>testing</b> <b>result</b> of violation or non-violation of a metamorphic relation are used. Since we need not to know the execution result for an individual test case, the existence of test oracle is no longer a prerequisite to SBFL. Experimenta...|$|E

First, {{environment}} {{quality is}} mainly {{measured by the}} graphic quality and the clear distribution; delivery quality is measured by attractiveness of selection, information quality, ease of use, and technical quality; outcome quality is measured by reliability, functional benefit, and emotional benefit. Second, the paths between first-order factor and second-order dimensions have a significantly positive impact. From Fig.  3 and Table  10, the testing results of the research hypotheses for the second-order dimensions show that all H 2 a, H 2 b, and H 2 c are empirically proven. (a) H 2 a: The <b>testing</b> <b>result</b> matches with the research results of Fullerton [21] and Yi and Gong [51]; that is, the higher environment quality provided by the shopping website, the the greater the impact on customers’ feelings towards the service quality of the shopping website, since consumers {{believe that they have}} obtained better service quality. (b) H 2 b: The <b>testing</b> <b>result</b> matches the research results of Fullerton [21] and Yi and Gong [51]: Delivery quality is directly proportional to service quality. The better the delivery quality provided by the shopping website, the better the received service quality to the consumers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to investigate, for the first time, the {{psychological}} impact of an inadequate smear <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> A prospective questionnaire design was used, and the setting was a single English cervical screening laboratory. Two groups of women receiving either a normal <b>test</b> <b>result</b> (n 226) or either a first or nonconsecutive inadequate smear <b>test</b> <b>result</b> (n 180) participated. The main outcome measures included State anxiety (STAI) and concern about <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> assessed within 4 weeks of receipt of results, and attendance for a repeat cervical smear within 3 months. Compared to women with normal <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> women with inadequate smear <b>test</b> <b>results</b> had higher state anxiety (P 0. 025), were more concerned about their results (Po 0. 001), perceived themselves to be at higher risk of cervical cancer (P 0. 016), and felt less satisfied with the information they had received about their <b>test</b> <b>results</b> (Po 0. 001). The only predictor of attendance for a repeat smear test following an inadequate smear <b>test</b> <b>result</b> was state anxiety (P 0. 011) : nonattenders had higher levels of state anxiety in response to their initial <b>test</b> <b>results.</b> In conclusion, in this first study to assess the psychological impact of receiving an inadequate smear <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> we have shown that it raises state anxiety and concern to levels similar to those found in women with abnormal smear <b>test</b> <b>results.</b> Of particular concern is that anxious women are less likely to attend for a repeat smear test within the recommended time frame.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> and for a given history of Pap <b>test</b> <b>results</b> in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. Methods: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997 - 2003 (five million tests for 1. 87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> and <b>test</b> <b>result</b> history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing and proportion of high grade (≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN 2]) abnormalities found in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s total recorded <b>test</b> <b>result</b> history; and (ii) with regard to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman 2 ̆ 7 s prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the 2 ̆ 71 in n 2 ̆ 7 odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> and by a given last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> for various prior Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> histories. Results: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> was 1 in 5546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN 1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age and by the highest Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> prior to the most recent Pap test result: the higher the age and, less consistently, the higher the previous highest Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> for a given last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer. Conclusions: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given Pap <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> and for some combinations of the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> and highest recorded prior Pap <b>test</b> <b>result...</b>|$|R
