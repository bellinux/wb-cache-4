5|$|I {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> {{was trying}} to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E

2500|$|Boys for Pele is Amos's first self-produced album; {{she would}} {{continue}} producing her own albums through Unrepentant Geraldines (2014). Given that the album {{deals with the}} role of women in religion and relationships, and particularly in light of her breakup with Eric Rosse, who had served as producer for her previous two albums, Amos felt that it was appropriate to take complete control over producing Boys for Pele, as a [...] "bid for independence". Of producing the album herself, Amos said, [...] "I was at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> could not answer to anybody. I'd been answering my whole life to some patriarchal figure." ...|$|E

[...] "There's nothing about title registration which reassures you the odometer hasn't been tampered with." [...] When Scalia pressed the lawyer on whether Schmuck would be culpable if he had had to mail the applications himself, Steinberg stood firm. The success of the title applications, he maintained, did {{not depend on the}} odometer readings, although Schmuck might have been committing mail fraud if he had mailed the original odometer slips himself. Scalia said he was contradicting his earlier argument that the mail was utterly irrelevant to the scheme, to which Steinberg said [...] "ou {{have to be able to}} point out how the mailing contributed to the success of the scheme." ...|$|E

Half the time, it's the Black Keys." [...] He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar.

You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you."

2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E

[...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience.

Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people.
