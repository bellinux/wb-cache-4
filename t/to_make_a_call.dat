It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, a man has a conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E

25|$|This {{approximation}} {{is sometimes}} {{known as the}} law of rare events, since each of the n individual Bernoulli events rarely occurs. The name may be misleading because the total count of success events in a Poisson process need not be rare if the parameter np is not small. For example, the number of telephone calls to a busy switchboard in one hour follows a Poisson distribution with the events appearing frequent to the operator, but they are rare {{from the point of}} view of the average member of the population who is very unlikely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> to that switchboard in that hour.|$|E

Moreover, asking for more money to keep a bankrupt business going was inopportune.|$|E
