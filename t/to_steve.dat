5|$|Apple Computer {{announced}} an intention to acquire NeXT on December 20, 1996. Apple paid $429million in cash, which {{went to the}} initial investors and 1.5million Apple shares, which went <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> Jobs, who was deliberately not given cash {{for his part in}} the deal. The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS, instead of BeOS or the in-development Copland. The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Young Battling Nelson again, in {{a rematch}} set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points {{a week later}} to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, sparring {{with the likes of}} Tim Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and {{in the latter half of}} 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America, a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East {{to victory}} with 29 points {{and was named}} the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.

Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 1998. In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards. In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5. Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Hoffman was filming , the final film in the series, and had already {{completed}} the majority of his scenes. His two remaining scenes were rewritten to compensate for his absence, and the film was released in November 2015. Hoffman was also preparing for his second directorial effort, a Prohibition-era drama titled Ezekiel Moss, which was to star Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. In addition, he had filmed a pilot episode for the Showtime series Happyish, in which he played the lead role of an advertising executive, but plans for a full season were put on hold following his death.

5|$|O'Sullivan {{captured}} {{two more}} ranking {{titles in the}} 1997/1998 season. By beating three-time defending champion Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final, O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title. O'Sullivan also triumphed at the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9–5 in the final. For the third year in a row, O'Sullivan made {{the final of the}} Charity Challenge. He was defeated, like the year previous, in a final frame decider, 8–9 to John Higgins. For {{the first time in three}} years O'Sullvian did not reach the final at the Masters, losing <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> Davis. After defeating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final of the Irish Masters, a post-match drug test found traces of cannabis in his system. O'Sullivan was stripped of the title, forfeited of the prize money and the title was awarded to Doherty by the WPBSA. O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals for the second time in his career, but lost 9–17 to eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Shearer did not {{score in}} England's opening 3–2 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England {{defeated}} Germany 1–0 in Charleroi, ensuring that England beat their European neighbours {{for the first}} time since the 1966 World Cup Final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2–1 up, but Romania ultimately won 3–2. England's tournament was over, and so was Shearer's international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored thirtygoals; joint-fifth in the England all-time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> McClaren after the 2006 World Cup – a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> Spurrier’s demands that he be able to call his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E

Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{chose to}} wear #8 {{as a tribute}} <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> Young, {{although}} several days later he decided to change it to #1, as #7 was already taken by Geno Smith. Vick became the first quarterback in franchise history to wear the number. During Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers, Vick came in relief of a struggling Geno Smith following halftime and finished the game with 47 passing yards as the Jets were shut out by the Chargers, 31–0. After seven consecutive losses, Rex Ryan named Vick the starter over Smith for the Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Vick became the first quarterback to reach 6,000 rushing yards during Week 10, in a 20–13 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, {{which was one of}} three games that Vick started for the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity <b>to</b> <b>Steve</b> by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
