500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle." [...] In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final chapter of Outliers [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking".|$|E

2500|$|After {{publication}} in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. [...] Catch-22 seemed {{to embody the}} feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. There are many who feel that [...] "the comic fable that ends in horror has {{become more and more}} clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live and hope to survive." ...|$|E

[...] In 1970 Creation Science, Inc., combined with a planned studies center at Christian Heritage College as the Creation-Science Research Center. Morris moved to San Diego to become director of the center and academic vice-president of the college. In the fall he presented a course at the college on [...] "Scientific Creationism", the first time he is known to have used the term in public.

In his Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004), he writes that, in order to avoid human beings treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the [...] "somewhat arbitrary decision" [...] to single out our own species for different and better treatment. [...] "Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? Of course it does, and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live, humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kittredge's {{administrative}} power, vast erudition, prestige, and the histrionic attitude {{he assumed}} with undergraduates provoked resentment. A notable critic was his colleague, Irving Babbitt (a professor of French) and Babbitt's former student, Stuart Sherman, who together founded so-called [...] "New Humanist" [...] school of literary appreciation. In a famous article in [...] The Nation of 1913, Sherman accused Kittredge of pedantry and of squeezing {{the life out}} of his subject. Deep ideological disagreements lay at the bottom of these attacks. The New Humanists were social and cultural conservatives who conceived of literary studies as leading to moral improvement by providing a guide to conduct and [...] "humane insight" [...] through an appreciation of and reflection on of the timeless beauties of prescribed [...] "great works." [...] Babbitt bitterly opposed the introduction of elective courses for undergraduates. Deeply suspicious of democracy, he envisioned the goal of a university education as the formation of a superior individual in whom the [...] "will to restraint" [...] would counter what he saw as the degenerate modernism he traced back to pernicious ideas of social progress initiated by Rousseau and his followers. Kittredge and his students, on the other hand, situated the study of languages and literatures in their historical contexts, seeking to capture [...] "the spirit of an age" [...] and often ranging far afield of the traditional Western canon. For Kittredge, reading Chaucer illuminated the world of the Middle Ages, which Kittredge often stated had points in common with our own age and thus helped students understand <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live. Often he guided his students into newly opening fields that he had not had time to investigate, such as Finnish and Celtic studies. According to David Bynum: ...|$|E
