5|$|Brought to Constantinople, Xiphias was tonsured and banished to Antigone, {{one of the}} Princes Islands. Following {{his return}} to the capital after his Georgian expedition, Basil II had most of his co-conspirators imprisoned and their estates confiscated. The patrikios Pherses the Iberian was executed, while two {{imperial}} chamberlains were also killed: one by Basil's own hand, and the other, who had tried to poison the Emperor, was <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beasts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street {{a couple of blocks}} from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next morning}} Changing Woman climbed a hill. [...] Looking in the {{distance}} she saw many monsters approaching {{from the south and}} from the west and from the north.

5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was delayed by rain for 56 minutes. The game was further {{interrupted}} by protesters, one of whom ran onto the field during the fifth inning {{and had to be}} <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground by César Valdez, a Cuban umpire. Contreras started the game for Cuba, and he allowed a two-run double by Baines in the first inning. Orioles' starting pitcher Scott Kamieniecki, who was on the MLB disabled list at the time, allowed four runs in the second inning to give Cuba the lead.|$|E
5|$|MI5 plant {{an asset}} Johnny Patel (San Shella) at the Parkmount mosque and {{community}} centre in Birmingham to follow Muhammed Rachid, an Afghan-born mullah who is acting more {{hostile to the}} West. Johnny however, is discovered to be a spy, and is <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surveillance van outside as a result. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) questions him in hospital, learning that the mullah is recruiting suicide bombers, however {{the stress of the}} questioning results in a cerebral hemorrhage. Superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) pressures Tom to find another agent. He turns to Tessa Phillips (Jenny Agutter), now a manager at a security firm since she was fired in the first series finale for running phantom agents for monetary gain. However, she refuses to help.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the surveillance van, which would give the audience {{the impression that the}} antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
25|$|Fielding weakly hit fair ground balls (including bunts) {{in front}} of home plate in order <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> a base to {{complete}} a groundout or a fielder's choice play.

500|$|A 4–5–4 play is a {{scenario}} involving the second baseman and third baseman. [...] In {{the case of}} the triple play, the second baseman records an out, <b>throws</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third baseman, who records a second out, and finally back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second baseman, who records the third and final out of the inning, all in one play.|$|R
50|$|For scorekeeping purposes, {{whatever}} {{position a}} player {{is listed as}} in the box score is the number they get assigned. For example, if a left fielder moves in <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> third base position, and a ball is hit to him, and he <b>throws</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> catcher <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> out, the play is record as 7-2.|$|R
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{between the}} ships was fiercely contested, but the {{smaller and more}} lightly armed Boston seemed to be taking the more serious damage when at 6:20 Captain Courtenay was <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck. What happened next has been subject to debate, with the second-in-command, Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time. However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him, a story that his family credited and was later {{taken up by the}} contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton, although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards' actions. With Courtenay gone, Boston continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07:00, when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape. Although Bompart pursued, by 08:00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back. After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River, Boston eventually escaped to St John's, Newfoundland while Embuscade refitted in New York.|$|E

Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{defensive}} principles is the [...] "force". The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force them <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in a particular direction (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "force side" [...] or [...] "open side"), whilst making it difficult for them <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction (the [...] "break side"). Downfield defenders make it hard for <b>the</b> receiving players <b>to</b> get free on the open/force side, knowing <b>throws</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> break side are less likely <b>to</b> be accurate. <b>The</b> space is divided in this way because it is very hard for the player marking <b>the</b> disc <b>to</b> stop every <b>throw,</b> and very hard for <b>the</b> downfield defenders <b>to</b> cover every space.|$|R
