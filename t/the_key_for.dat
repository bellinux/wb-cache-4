5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed to stay on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which {{will result in a}} technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket and skirt, with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> safekeeping.

5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe.

The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> the success of the captaincies of São Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to utilize Indian slaves for sugar cultivation, but shifted to the use of black African slave labor.|$|E

Our mechanism possesses three unique features, 1) a high efficiency of constructing <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> users and the locks for the files; 2) a simple operation on <b>the</b> user’s <b>key</b> and on <b>the</b> file’s lock allows the user access to the file; and 3) <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> adding or deleting a user can be updated easily without affecting <b>the</b> existing <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> other users...|$|R

25|$|It is the {{existence}} of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> identifying MS5236 as being stamped and not written. Because {{it is a matter of}} mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS5236 is a colourless blind print.|$|E

Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release. He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> the film was {{to return to the}} roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.
