500|$|Skelton's {{first major}} post-television {{recognition}} came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named {{him as the}} recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. [...] His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> sitting down", he said when the ovation subsided. [...] "I thought you were pulling a CBS and walking out on me." [...] The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves.|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Daft Punk {{appeared}} in a short tribute to Rodgers {{as part of a}} documentary on his life titled [...] "Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk". In the short clip, the two send a [...] "transmission" [...] to Rodgers with the message, [...] "Dear Nile, We are sending you this transmission <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> all your amazing songs. Your music continues to inspire the world... With love, Daft Punk". Later in 2015, a documentary on Daft Punk titled Daft Punk Unchained was released. The film covers Daft Punk's music career from the 1990s up to and including their 2014 Grammy appearance. The documentary features interviews with Rodgers, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and others who have interacted with the duo in their projects.|$|E

The Oregonian also reported that {{the restaurant}}'s phone number was disconnected and its website inactive. Signage confirmed the closure, stating: [...] "Esparza's will be temporarily closed while renovating and regrouping. Thank you for your patience. We will re-open soon." [...] However, several days later, the owners confirmed the restaurant's permanent closure, posting a note that said: [...] "We have closed our business after 24 years. We would like <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> supporting us. We have enjoyed the friendships made over the years. We are starting {{a new chapter in}} our lives– relaxing and enjoying life. Thank you for your support." [...] The Oregonian published an article containing memories of the restaurant submitted by readers. Esparza's was replaced by The Blue Goose, a [...] "Southwestern-grill-meets-New-Mexico" [...] restaurant serving Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, named after the neighborhood tavern of similar title that occupied the building.|$|E

500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I would also like <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{nowhere to}} go, the Cheyennes walked to Fort Robinson and surrendered. Due to General Crook's winter campaigning, the {{remaining}} hostiles under Sitting Bull {{were not able}} to hunt for buffalo so by the spring of 1877 they surrendered at Fort Robinson as well. Now that the war was over, the Pawnee scouts were disbanded for good on May 1, 1877 and returned to the Indian Territory. Major North retired from his military life the same year, General Crook wrote; [...] "I think it only just and appropriate <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> your excellent behavior during the time of your stay in the Military service under my command, and to say that the soldier-like conduct and discipline of the Pawnee Scouts is the most eloquent testimony that could be adduced to prove your fitness for the position you have held as their Commanding Officer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tudor Wilkinson, {{as far as}} is known, was not detained. After the war, the American Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Investigation Unit {{wrote that}} he kept a watch on the Paris art market for Sepp Angerer, Hermann Göring's art agent, and that Dolores had been {{released}} from Vittel after Göring made a personal visit to the Wilkinsons' apartment. In his life of Göring, David Irving wrote that the visit took place in 1940, and that Wilkinson wrote to Göring a year later {{to thank him for}} interceding, and telling him that he should keep a painting of Juliana von Stolberg that he had admired in their apartment: [...] "We both agreed that we wanted you to have 'Juliana' always, <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> what you so modestly did for [...]" [...] In 1946, Tudor Wilkinson was placed on the OSS [...] "red flag" [...] list of people and organisations that were involved in the art trade under the Nazis, with the caveat that police reports indicated that he was active in the resistance.|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E
