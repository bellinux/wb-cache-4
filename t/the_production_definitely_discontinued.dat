Prevention of undesirable overflow into <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of oxalate <b>definitely</b> leads to a decrease of urolithiasis. The activity of serine : pyruvate/alanine : glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT) or glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), the key enzyme of primary hyperoxlauria type 1 and 2, respectively, and their subcellular distribution highly affects theoxalateproduction. On theothe r hand, urolithiasis is tightly related to lifestyle disease, such as diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. The hypothesis that insulin resistance induces mitochondria dysfunction, resulting in the decrease of mitochondria-related enzyme activity is a very attractive new treatment strategy of urolithiasis. Namely, the improvement of insulin resistance might prevent stone formation...|$|R

While the exploration activities find oil and gas reserves, <b>the</b> <b>production</b> activities deliver oil and gas to the downstream of the industry. <b>The</b> petroleum <b>production</b> is <b>definitely</b> <b>the</b> heart of the petroleum industry. Petroleum production engineering is that part of petroleum engineering that attempts to maximize oil and gas production in a cost-effective manner. To achieve this objective, production engineers need to have a thorough understanding of <b>the</b> petroleum <b>production</b> systems with which they work. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the most important advances in petroleum <b>production</b> engineering in <b>the</b> past decade. Of course, a review paper in the allotted space simply cannot do justice to all new technologies, especially those that are advances to established techniques. We then expound upon two technologies that we feel have made already or have the capacity of quantum impact on the petroleum industry. These are high-permeability fracturing (often referred to in the vernacular as frac-pack and variants) and complex well architecture which deals with wells with a main or mother bore from which branches are drilled. ...|$|R
50|$|Reviews by {{more recent}} critics are a mixed bag. British critic Phil Hardy calls The Woman Eater 'an {{improbable}} shocker' and writes that 'the direction, acting and scripting are all questionable and totally lack the silliness {{required to get}} away with such a motif, best seen in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors (1960) with its carnivorous piece of flora'. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, American critic Bryan Senn gives Saunders a nod for doing much with little. 'Though <b>the</b> <b>production</b> is <b>definitely</b> on <b>the</b> cheap, director Charles Saunders makes the most of both the English countryside (often going outside to shoot to give the picture a more expansive - and authentic - feel) and the huge old manor house that stood in for Moran's mansion', he writes. He compliments the film's art director, Herbert Smith, for his 'bang-up basement/dungeon lab set, its medieval-style stone staircase, pillars, dank walls and iron gates contrasting nicely with the tables of shining glass beakers and medical apparatus, generating an atmosphere of ominous menace'. Unlike Senn, however, the anonymous reviewer in BoxOffice magazine's 'Feature Review' in 1959 was unimpressed by the laboratory set with its 'dark and dingy brick-walled basements and hundreds of bubbling or smoking test tubes and other similar laboratory paraphernalia'. Warren refers to the direction as 'ponderous' and says it 'makes a slow story painfully halting, in a point-by-point plodding technique of showing all actions'.|$|R

Commercially available stereoscopic cameras are too expensive for non professionals. When producing a stereo video with two separate standard cameras, synchronicity and spatial offset maintenance between the two views is a challenging non-trivial task. Even when this is done properly, the general lack of software-tools for stereo video post <b>production</b> <b>definitely</b> daunts any non-professional ambitions. In this work we present a tool for preprocessing stereoscopic videos.
