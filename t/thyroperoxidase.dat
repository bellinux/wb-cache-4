5000|$|More specifically, the monoatomic, anionic form of iodine, iodide, —, is {{actively}} absorbed from the bloodstream {{by a process}} called iodide trapping. In this process, sodium is cotransported with iodide from the basolateral side of the membrane into the cell, and then concentrated in the thyroid follicles to about thirty times its concentration in the blood. Then, in the first reaction catalysed by the enzyme <b>thyroperoxidase,</b> tyrosine residues in the protein thyroglobulin are iodinated on their phenol rings, at {{one or both of}} the positions ortho to the phenolic hydroxyl group, yielding monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT), respectively. This introduces 1-2 atoms of the element iodine, covalently bound, per tyrosine residue. The further coupling together of two fully iodinated tyrosine residues, also catalysed by <b>thyroperoxidase,</b> yields the peptidic (still peptide-bound) precursor of thyroxine, and coupling one molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT yields the comparable precursor of triiodothyronine: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{protein is}} a {{precursor}} of the thyroid hormones; these are produced when thyroglobulin's tyrosine residues are combined with iodine and the protein is subsequently cleaved. Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100-120 tyrosine residues, {{but only a}} small number (20) of these are subject to iodination by <b>thyroperoxidase</b> in the follicular colloid. Therefore, each Tg molecule forms only approximately 10 thyroid hormone molecules.|$|E
50|$|The genes implicated vary in {{different}} ethnic groups and the incidence is increased in people with chromosomal disorders, including Turner, Down, and Klinefelter syndromes usually associated with autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase.</b> Progressive depletion of these cells as the cytotoxic immune response leads to higher degrees of primary hypothyroidism, presenting with a poverty of T3/T4 levels, and compensatory elevations of TSH.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of action {{are not completely}} understood. Some scientists believe that anti-thyroids inhibit iodination of tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin. It is thought that they inhibit the <b>thyroperoxidase</b> catalyzed oxidation reactions by acting as substrates for the postulated peroxidase-iodine complex, thus competitively inhibiting the interaction with the amino acid tyrosine. Propylthiouracil additionally may reduce the de-iodination of T4 into T3 in peripheral tissues.|$|E
50|$|The thyroid {{epithelial}} cells take up iodine and amino acids {{from the blood}} circulation on the basolateral side, synthesize thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase</b> from amino acids and secrete these into the thyroid follicles together with iodine. The thyroid {{epithelial cells}} can subsequently take up iodinated thyroglobulin from the follicles by endocytosis, extract thyroid hormones from it {{with the help of}} proteases and subsequently release thyroid hormones to the blood.|$|E
50|$|Thyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are {{drugs that}} inhibit the {{production}} of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US), and propylthiouracil. Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by <b>thyroperoxidase</b> and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated {{over a period of}} months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.|$|E
5000|$|Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a 660 kDa, dimeric protein {{produced}} by the follicular cells of the thyroid and used entirely within the thyroid gland. Thyroxine is {{produced by}} attaching iodine atoms to the ring structures of this protein's tyrosine residues; thyroxine (T4) contains four iodine atoms, while triiodothyronine (T3), otherwise identical to T4, has one less iodine atom per molecule. The thyroglobulin protein accounts for {{approximately half of the}} protein content of the thyroid gland. Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100-120 tyrosine residues, a small number of which (<20) are subject to iodination catalysed by <b>thyroperoxidase.</b> The same enzyme then catalyses [...] "coupling" [...] of one modified tyrosine with another, via a free radical-mediated reaction, and when these iodinated bicyclic molecules are released by hydrolysis of the protein, T3 and T4 are the result. hence, each Tg protein molecule ultimately yields very small amounts of thyroid hormone (experimentally observed to be on the order of 5-6 molecules of either T4 or T3 per original molecule of Tg).|$|E

40|$|TTF- 1 and Pax- 8 are thyroid-specific {{transcription}} factors, from homeo and paired box genes, respectively, {{that are}} responsible for thyroid development and for thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase</b> gene expression. However, TTF- 1 and Pax- 8 preferentially bind to the thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase</b> promoters, respectively. Here, we have studied a patient with defective thyroglobulin synthesis. Thyroglobulin mRNA was found at very low levels while the mRNA for <b>thyroperoxidase</b> was found to be more abundant compared with control tissue. The low levels of thyroglobulin mRNA are caused by a transcriptional defect due to the virtual absence of TTF- 1 expression as determined by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

RESULTS: Women with elevated <b>thyroperoxidase</b> antibody levels {{in the first and}} second trimesters have a higher rate of placental abruption than antibody-negative women. This relationship is less strong in the first trimester (1. 51 % compared with 0. 83 %; odds ratio [OR], 1. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 99 – 3. 37) than in the second trimester (1. 78 % compared with 0. 82 %; OR, 2. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 21 – 3. 99). A similar, but weaker, relationship is present forthyroglobulin antibodies. Sixty-four of 782 <b>thyroperoxidase</b> antibody-positive pregnancies without abruption become negative by the second trimester; one pregnancy with abruptionbecomes antibody-positive.

40|$|Transformation of {{the thyroid}} cell line FRTL- 5 results in loss or {{reduction}} of differentiation {{as measured by}} the expression of thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase,</b> two proteins whose genes are exclusively expressed in thyroid follicular cells. The biochemical mechanisms leading to this phenomenon were investigated in three cell lines obtained by transformation of FRTL- 5 cells with Ki-ras, Ha-ras, and polyomavirus middle-T oncogenes. With the ras oncogenes, transformation leads to undetectable expression of the thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase</b> genes. However, the mechanisms responsible for the extinction of the differentiated phenotype seem to be different for the two ras oncogenes. In Ki-ras-transformed cells, the mRNA encoding TTF- 1, a transcription factor controlling thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase</b> gene expression, is severely reduced. On the contrary, nearly wild-type levels of TTF- 1 mRNA are detected in Ha-ras-transformed cells. Furthermore, overexpression of TTF- 1 can activate transcription of the thyroglobulin promoter in Ki-ras-transformed cells, whereas it has no effect on thyroglobulin transcription in the Ha-ras-transformed line. Expression of polyoma middle-T antigen in thyroid cells leads to only a reduction of differentiation and does not severely affect either the activity or the amount of TTF- 1. Another thyroid cell-specific transcription factor, TTF- 2, is more sensitive to transformation, since it disappears in all three transformed lines, and probably contributes to the reduced expression of the differentiated phenotype...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thyrotropin}} (TSH) and {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) on the synthesis of proteins has been studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in primary cultures of thyroid cells developing as a monolayer or that remained associated as dense aggregates. (1) A 4 -day treatment of monolayer cells by TSH or dibutyryl cAMP enhanced the synthesis of 26 proteins and decreased that of 19 others. (2) The synthesis of 29 proteins was similarly modified by TSH and dibutyryl cAMP in both types of culture organizations. Both agents stimulated the synthesis of <b>thyroperoxidase</b> and of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) /cyclin and decreased that of actin and of a high Mr isoform of tropomyosin. (3) TSH induced the retraction of monolayer cells. Its effect on the synthesis of many proteins was mimicked by culturing unstimulated cells as dense aggregates instead of monolayers which similarly affected cell morphology. (4) EGF alone {{had no effect on}} protein synthesis in monolayer cells but it inhibited both the morphological changes induced by TSH and dibutyryl cAMP and the effect of these agents on the synthesis of 23 proteins including <b>thyroperoxidase.</b> In conclusion: (1) TSH and cAMP induce both proliferation and the expression of differentiation in thyroid cells while EGF has a small mitogenic effect but a marked inhibitory action on differentiation expression; (2) many TSH (cAMP) and EGF effects on the pattern of protein synthesis might be related to morphological changes; (3) the expression of the differentiation marker <b>thyroperoxidase</b> and of the mitogenic marker PCNA/cyclin appears independent of cell configuration and morphology.

40|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the target}} of several {{autoimmune}} diseases. Specific thyroid proteins {{have been identified as}} autoantigens associated with these diseases (e. g. <b>thyroperoxidase,</b> thyroglobulin and the thyrotrophin (TSH) receptor). In this paper, we report that the serum of a patient suffering from Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune gastritis and rheumatoid arthritis was able to inhibit the chronic TSH-induced I- uptake of dog thyrocytes in culture, even at a 1 : 1000 -fold dilution, without affecting their 86 Rb+ uptake. This blocking activity is rare as 147 sera (from patients positive for antibodies to the thyroid microsomes and the gastric parietal cell antigen, patients with Sjögren's syndrome, patients with a high titre of microsomal antibodies and low or negative for antibodies to <b>thyroperoxidase,</b> and patients with a high titre of microsomal antibodies and frank hypothyroidism) were negative when tested for their ability to inhibit I- uptake. Subsequently we tested 20 murine monoclonal antibodies previously obtained by immunizing mice with a crude human thyroid membrane preparation, which were all negative when tested against thyroglobulin and <b>thyroperoxidase.</b> One of the monoclonal antibodies displayed a 50 % inhibition of the chronic TSH-induced 125 I- uptake of dog thyrocytes without affecting the 86 Rb+ uptake of the cells. Immunoglobulins purified from the ascite fluid by affinity chromatography on a protein A cellulose column had the same characteristics. Taken together, the data suggest that thyroidal 125 I- uptake can be inhibited by antibodies, that autoantibodies in the patient's serum are most probably responsible for the observed inhibition and therefore that the Na+/I- cotransporter is probably an autoantigen.

40|$|The thyroid-stimulating hormone/thyrotropin (TSH) is {{the most}} {{relevant}} hormone in the control of thyroid gland physiology in adulthood.
