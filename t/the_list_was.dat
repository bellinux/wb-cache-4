5|$|HMV's Poll of Polls was {{an annual}} list of albums {{compiled}} by British music retailer HMV from 1998 to 2012.

An album's placing in <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>was</b> determined {{by the number of}} different polls in which it was included. In the event of two records featuring in the same number of polls, the album with the highest combined placings was given the higher position on the Poll of Polls.

5|$|In early April 2009, {{a carbon}} copy of {{one version of}} <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} at the State Library of New South Wales by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by author Thomas Keneally.

This version of the list contains 801 names and is dated 18 April 1945; Pfefferberg is listed as worker number 173.

5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port.

She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
