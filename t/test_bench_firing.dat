By {{analyzing}} two old {{forms of}} hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> (Traditional hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and throttling hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench),</b> the new hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> applies a new energy recycle technology and avoids enormous energy consumption. For the new <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> this paper gives {{the definition of}} energy saving rate, which is generally {{used to measure the}} effect on saving system energy. It also analyzes the working principles of the new <b>test</b> <b>bench’s</b> obverse processes. The displacement of the loading pump should adapt to the change of the diameter ratio of the main drum and the auxiliary drum, so we use one loading pump and limit its displacement to realize energy recycle. Furthermore, the new <b>test</b> <b>bench’s</b> experiment is carried out to evaluate the efficiency of this <b>test</b> <b>bench’s</b> energy saving rate. The average energy saving rate is 57. 88 % from test, and this <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> realizes energy recycle...|$|R

40|$|Passive damping is used {{to reduce}} {{vibrations}} of machining tools. The drawback with the passive damping system {{is that it is}} adjusted to damp out vibrations in one restricted frequency range. Active damping uses real time measurements to dampen the vibrations and is not tuned for one specific frequency range. Teeness AS {{wants to be able to}} investigate different ways of regulating an active damping system on a physical <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and to investigate if an Arduino is suited for regulating the system. This paper presents the design development of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and an electrical setup with Arduino as the regulating controller. Actuators were evaluated and purchased. The <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was designed to fit the actuators using Siemens NX as CAD program. The components of the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were produced by Teeness AS. Simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were conducted using FEDEM to investigate the dynamics of the system. Requirements for the Arduino were investigated and regulating scripts were coded, tested and evaluated. The simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was able to significantly reduce the vibrations investigated. However there were some behaviors of the simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> that differ from the measurements made of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> This was most likely a result of the modeling of actuators. The results from the simulations give an indication of the general behavior of the <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> but the use of exact values should be avoided. To improve the validity of the simulations, further work with the simulation of the actuators should be conducted. Using an Arduino as a control mechanism seems promising, but further work needs to be done to reduce the noise of the sensor data and the regulating script presented in this paper should be improved...|$|R
40|$|Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy {{manufactures}} drill rigs, {{which are}} machines used for rock drilling. A drill rig has {{one or more}} rock drills that perform the actual drilling. The rock drills are <b>tested</b> in <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> which are automatic test systems. These drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are used mainly for assuring quality of manufactured rock drills. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis process, Sandvik had project plans on building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> for <b>testing</b> durability of new rock drill products in the product development stage. Durability testing involves long test runs where test phases are repeated several times. The new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> required a new control system to be developed. The control system is an embedded system consisting of several components, some of which run the Linux operating system. Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches.</b> In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis. All levels of the control system are described briefly from both hardware and software perspectives. However, the thesis will not go into details of other software components beyond the testing framework since they were not implemented by the author. The project plans for building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> based on the new control system were cancelled late in the process of writing this thesis. Therefore, no feedback from production use was received. The control system can, however, be deployed later in new drill <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> projects or when an old drill <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> control system is updated. Based on current assessment, the project has achieved its goals. The new software used for creating tests has better usability than the one used in a previous drill <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> Maintainability of the control system is also considerably better than in previous drill <b>test</b> <b>benches...</b>|$|R

In the first <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> two receivers are simultaneously irradiated by natural sunlight via parabolic troughs that are mounted on a two axis tracking stage.

The second, the solar simulator <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> consists of an elliptical cylinder with flat end reflectors. Metal halide lamps (HMI) and the receiver are positioned in the two respective focal lines. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in two modes: Cold performance tests with water flow through the receiver at near ambient temperature in order to measure the optical efficiency in the stationary enthalpy increase, secondly hot testing with the empty receiver at typical operating temperature in order to compare irradiant power and steady state thermal loss power and calculate the efficiency. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in combination with classic heat loss measurement, together the three <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> form a complementary set.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a novel {{concept of an}} air bearing <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> for CubeSat ground testing together with the corresponding dynamic parameter identification method. Contrary to existing air bearing <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> the proposed concept allows three degree-of-freedom unlimited rotations and minimizes {{the influence of the}} <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> on the <b>tested</b> CubeSat. These advantages are made possible by the use of a robotic wrist which rotates air bearings in order to make them follow the CubeSat motion. Another keystone of the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> is an accurate balancing of the tested CubeSat. Indeed, disturbing factors acting on the satellite shall be minimized, the most significant one being the gravity torque. An efficient balancing requires the CubeSat center of mass position to be accurately known. Usual techniques of dynamic parameter identification cannot be directly applied because of the frictionless suspension of the CubeSat in the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and, accordingly, {{due to the lack of}} external actuation.

This method does not require any external actuation and is based on the sampling of free oscillating motions of the CubeSat mounted on the <b>test</b> <b>bench...</b>|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{testing methods}} are {{becoming}} more and more prevalent to increase the reliability of wind turbines. In this field, dynamometers that allow for system level tests of full-scale nacelles will play an important role. Operating these <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> in a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) set-up that emulates realistic drive train modes is challenging because of the relatively low stiffness of the load machines’ drive trains. This paper proposes a control method for enabling the said operation mode.

40|$|Assessment of {{vertical}} spray profile {{is one of}} the main steps to adjust sprayers for bush and tree crops, as it allows to verify that the spray plume matches the target canopy profile. The equipment used for assessing the vertical spray profile is typically a vertical <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> or patternator. Even if the sprayer adjustment is recommended in EU Directive 128 / 2009 /EC, the use {{of vertical}} <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> is only optional in the procedures for the inspection of air-assisted sprayers in use currently adopted in the EU Member States, that mainly refer to EN 13790 - 2 and to new ENISO FDIS 16122 - 3. At present, in the International Standards, there is not any indication of the minimum requirements that the vertical <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> have to fulfill, neither in terms of constructive characteristics or of functional parameters. For this reason, the types of vertical <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> used in the test stations, even if are based on the same principle of functioning (presence of a vertical surface to collect the whole liquid sprayed and of graduated tubes for measuring it), present some differences in terms of structure, mainly related to collectors types and their disposal along the <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> Two main categories of vertical <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> can be identified: 1) equipped with a continuous collecting wall; 2) equipped with a discrete number of separated collectors. In each category it is then possible to have different models, depending on the size, materials, number and position of the collectors. With the main purpose to define methodology and criteria for the vertical patternator evaluation, specific performance tests were carried out in laboratory using four different types of vertical <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> and a horizontal <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> complying with ISO 5682 - 1 requirements.
