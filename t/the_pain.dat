5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> (whether <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> and factors that make <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient the cause of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress {{is a key element}} in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E

5000|$|Some readers see {{the poem}} as Keats' {{personal}} rebellion against <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> of love.

However, the ballad is a very objective form, and it may be best to read [...] "La Belle Dame sans Merci" [...] as pure story and no more.|$|R

5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> {{sensation}} {{and processing}} system may not function properly; creating {{the feeling of}} pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much pain from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing to control <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> {{of a growing}} tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> goes away, and is probably an important reason why <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> from the sting.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of grief itself.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10â€“40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E

5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms.
