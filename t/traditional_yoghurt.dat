40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Because of yoghurt is a {{particular}} flavor (caused by diacetyl) and appropriate essential oils (from Atanal) as well as enjoy the soft tissue, it is considered {{as one of the}} most palatable dairy products. With regards to the yoghurt portion in supplement of protein food needs in our society, it is necessary to ensure its health. In this research the hygienic quality of <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> (no licensed) and industrial yoghurt (licensed) during hot and cold seasons (2015 - 2016) was evaluated. The samples collected from distributed yoghurt in Qazvin province, Iran. 						Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, distributed yoghurt in Qazvin province has formed our statistical society. A total of 95 samples hand-picked during hot and cold seasons randomly. Samples were transferred at 4 °C to the laboratory. The microbiological characteristics of the samples were evaluated in accordance with ISIRI 695. Searching for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus and also coliforms counting were done according to national standards (ISIRI 5234; ISIRI 6806; ISIRI 5486) by Lauryl Sulfate broth and EC broth, Baird-Parker agar, VRBL agar and Brilliant Green Bile Lactose broth. The YGC agar medium was used for count of fungi (molds and yeasts). 						Results: Microbial count showed a significant difference between the traditional and industrial yoghurt samples at the levels which were considered significantly different at P< 0. 05. The result showed that <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> samples are highly contaminated with microbes than industrial ones and within <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> samples; There was a noteworthy difference on the fungi totals at warm seasons. 						 					 				 			 			 			 		 	 Conclusions: Results have shown that microbial load increase in <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> during summer, noticeably. It can indicate poor health conditions in the units, failure to maintain cold chain and inadequate training for vendors dairy products...|$|E

40|$|Alkaline {{phosphatase}} is {{an indigenous}} milk enzyme and is probably, {{the most important}} indigenous milk enzyme from a dairy technology viewpoint {{which is used to}} determine the efficacy of the pasteurization process. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the alkaline phosphatase activity of 200 samples of industrial and <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> ice cream and cheese, as well as raw and pasteurized milk samples. To achieve this purpose, p-nitrophenylphosphate was used as substrate and the amount of liberated p-nitrophenol was measured spectrophotometrically. The amount of liberated p-nitrophenol in all samples of raw milk was very high (6839 ± 4070 µg/ml) but in pasteurized milk samples, the amount was in the range of 0. 75 - 52. 96 µg/ml and 88 % of the samples had less than 10 µg p-nitrophenol/ml, the maximum permissible limit of p-nitrophenol in pasteurized products. The amount of liberated p-nitrophenol was in the range of 5. 68 - 1210 µg/ml and 2. 61 - 18. 22 µg/ml in traditional and industrial cheese samples, respectively and it was estimated at the range of 0. 75 - 26. 67 µg/ml and 0. 71 - 35. 82 µg/ml for traditional and industrial ice cream samples, respectively. The lowest alkaline phosphatase activity was observed in both industrial and <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> samples. Meanwhile, p-nitrophenol in 12 % of industrial cheese, 44 % of traditional cheese and 16 % of both industrial and traditional ice cream samples was higher than 10 µg/ml which could be due to the inadequate pasteurization of the product or cross contamination with raw milk. The results of the present study showed a need for more strict attention in the pasteurization of milk and its products...|$|E

40|$|Interest in the {{microbiota}} {{of traditional}} fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, continues {{due to the}} need for new lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains that can complement or replace currently-in-use starters. In this work, five <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurts</b> and one milk sample (for making yoghurt) from different areas of the Khorasan-e-Razavi region, Iran, were subjected to microbial characterization. Among the 102 isolates recovered, which included 29 from milk, the thermophilic LAB species Streptococcus thermophilus (34) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (36) (with similar numbers of the subsp. bulgaricus and lactis) were the majority bacteria in all samples. Wide intra-species phenotypic and genetic diversity was encountered among the isolates. The safety and technological features of 29 strains belonging to the species S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, all candidates for use in yoghurt-making, were examined. In culture, two S. thermophilus strains produced the biogenic amine histamine from histidine (its precursor amino acid), and five L. delbrueckii strains showed atypical resistance to tetracycline (MIC ≥  8  μg mL). The remaining strains coagulated milk, producing a coagulum of good appearance and pleasant acidic aroma. None of them produced appreciable amounts of exopolysaccharides in milk under the incubation conditions. After fermentation of milk with individual and mixed strains, major yoghurt aroma volatile compounds (i. e. acetaldehyde, diacetyl and acetic acid) were detected. Also as being used in the design of commercial starters, the thermophilic LAB strains characterized in this study might be used to help improve the safety of <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurts,</b> while maintaining their original qualitative and sensorial characteristics.

40|$|Fermented milk products, {{for example}} yoghurts contain less lactose than the {{ordinary}} milk, however, this quantity of lactose can cause lactose intolerance. The {{aim of the}} work was to produce lactose free fermented milk products based on the lactose hydrolysed milk. Products were fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (N 71) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (N 1), Lactobacillus helveticus (N 43), Lactobacillus acidophilus (N 42). The growth characteristics, the acidity, the most important aroma productivity and the lactose content were measured. Products were evaluated with organoleptical test. Products were lactose free, so they are suitable for people suffering from lactose intolerance. There were differences among the acid content {{at the end of}} fermentation. In case of normal yoghurt culture acid content was 29. 6 SH° and in case of probiotic cultures 30. 4 SH° and 37. 5 SH°, respectively.

They grow synergistically in milk by acidifying milk, produce specific aroma compounds and lactic acid which impact {{the quality of the}} yoghurt. Imported cultures are widely used in dairy industry to stabilize the technological properties which cause a change in our natural flora and flavour. Starters from <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurts</b> have to be preserved. Under this perspective, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the medium requirements of mixed starter cultures for production of starter bacteria which has been isolated and characterized before. Determination of medium requirements were done in a whey-based media. Since bacteriophages were one of the most important problem in dairy industry, to prevent cultures from phage adsorption, media was treated with different salts which can bind free calcium ions. Salts were examined for cell viability and phage infection effects. From these studies Na 2 HPO 4 + KH 2 PO 4 with 2 % of medium addition was chosen as the most effective. Mineral requirements of the mixed cultures were determined. The best combination; 10, 5, 50 ppm for Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 + ions with 0, 939 desirability were used for initial mineral content of medium. Fermentation constants for mixed cultures were determined. Pure culture fermentations and mixed culture fermentations were performed.

L. plantarum WCFS 1 was precultured under sublethal stress conditions (combinations of elevated NaCl and low pH) in a batch fermentor before inoculation in milk. Adaptive responses of L. plantarum WCFS 1 were evaluated by monitoring bacterial population dynamics, milk acidification and changes in volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt. The results demonstrated that sublethal preculturing did not significantly affect survival of L. plantarum WCFS 1. On the other hand, incorporation of sublethally precultured L. plantarum WCFS 1 significantly impaired the survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus which consequently reduced the post-acidification of yoghurt during refrigerated storage. A complementary metabolomics approach using headspace SPME-GC/MS and 1 H NMR combined with multivariate statistical analysis revealed substantial impact of sublethally precultured L. plantarum WCFS 1 on the metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} play divergent {{and important}} roles for human beings: On {{the one hand}} they include major bacterial pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae {{and on the other}} hand many species are used as starter cultures for the manufacture of fermented food (i. e., dairy products, meat, vegetables, wine, sour dough, cocoa) and silage. S. thermophilus is one of the most important lactic acid bacteria required for the manufacture of yogurt, mozzarella and other cheese varieties (e. g. Cheddar and Swiss-type cheeses). Bacteriophage attacks are always a serious problem in industrial fermentations leading to significant financial losses. Characterization of bacteriophage populations is therefore the first step of efficient phage control in dairies and other food fermentation industries. The aim of the work described in Chapter 1 was to identify and characterize a new temperate S. thermophilus phage (i. e., phage TP- 778) that was induced from its lysogenic host strain S. thermophilus SK 778. Phage TP- 778 revealed the typical morphology of all known S. thermophilus phages with isometric heads and long non-contractile tails. It was classified as a pac-type phage with a genome size of ca. 44 kb. No prophage-cured strain could be obtained, indicating that correct excision of prophage DNA from the host chromosomal DNA was prevented. Phage TP- 778 could be propagated lytically on the non-lysogenic S. thermophilus strain B 106, and a lytically propagated derivative (i. e., TP- 778 L) was isolated and also characterised as described in this chapter. When phage TP- 778 DNA was used as a probe for Southern blot analysis of the chromosomal DNAs of a set of non-lysogenic S. thermophilus strains, an unexpected high background of unspecific hybridization signals appeared in the DNAs of all strains. This indicated that the phage TP- 778 genome could (1) either carry DNA homologous to the chromosomal DNA of S. thermophilus starter strains or (2) that the phage would be capable to package (and consequently transduce) chromosomal DNA during phage proliferation. In order to address these questions, a detailed DNA sequence analysis was performed for the lysogeny module of the phage genome and its flanking regions from the phage lysin gene to the phage cro regulatory protein gene. This genomic region was selected since it should reveal all genetic determinants for prophage integration/excision (i. e. integrase gene), for establishing the lysogenic/lytic phage life cycle (i. e., regulatory genes of the genetic switch) and furthermore the junction sites between prophage and bacterial DNA (i. e., attL and attR). The 2 neighbouring prophage regions from the left prohage/chromosome junction site (attL-site) to cro gene (fragment attL-cro) and from the lysin gene to the expected attR-site (fragment lysin-attR) located on the opposite flanking region of the prophage DNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the lysin-attR prophage DNA revealed the presence of about 1. 9 -kb prophage remnant DNA. A truncated 398 -bp integrase gene was present on the phage remnant. A functional attR-site was also deleted from this prophage fragment, indicating that integration or excision of the prophage could not occur by the site-specific recombination via homologous attP and attB sites. Hence, this fragment was renamed as lysin-attR fragment. While only a non-functional (truncated) integrase was identified on the lysin-attR prophage fragment, a complete 1080 -bp integrase gene was identified on the attL-cro DNA fragment. This core region of the TP- 778 lysogeny module was highly homologous to the corresponding region of the well-characterized S. thermophilus temperate phage TP-J 34 (Neve et al., 2003) and did also code for a unique lipoprotein (Orf 142 TP- 778). Hence it was concluded that prophage TP- 778 is directly associated with a prophage remnant in the lysogenic host strain. In order to confirm that TP- 778 can package extra DNA, a 16 S rDNA region was amplified from purified phage particles treated with DNase I to destroy any non-packaged chromosomal DNA contaminations. The positive PCR reaction was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using the 16 S rDNA probe. It was concluded that phage TP- 778 and its lytic derivative (TP- 778 L) were both capable of packaging chromosomal host DNA. The core region of the lysogeny module of lytically propagated phage derivative TP- 778 L was also analysed by DNA sequencing. Phage TP- 778 L contained a 398 -bp truncated recombinant integrase gene remnant. By alignment with the intact 1080 -bp integrase gene of phage TP- 778 and with the 398 -bp integrase gene fragment present on the prophage remnant, it was shown that the TP- 778 L integrase fragment exhibited a recombinant structure originating from a homologous recombination event between the two integrase determinants present in the lysogenic SK 778 cells. In Chapter 2 comparisons of genes ltpTP- 778 (orf 142 TP- 778) of phage TP- 778 and ltpTP-J 34 (orf 142 TP- 778) of phage TP-J 34 and their corresponding gene products are presented. The lipoprotein gene ltpTP- 778 of phage TP- 778 is closely related to the corresponding gene ltpTP-J 34 of phage TP-J 34. Previously, ltpTP-J 34 has been shown to code for a unique superinfection exclusion system. This phage resistance mechanism was also active in a lactococcal host background against the isometric-headed phage P 008 but not aggainst the prolate-headed phage P 001 (Sun et al., 2006). The amino acid sequences of both deduced lipoproteins differed only by 10 amino acids. The ltpTP- 778 gene was cloned into the expression vector pMG 36 e. The resulting recombinant plasmid pYAL 1 was also transformed into the Lactococcus lactis strain Bu 2 - 60 in order to assess its effect of ltpTP- 778 on the phage resistance phenotype of the cells. Gene expression of LtpTP- 778 in strain Bu 2 - 60 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis, but the protein did not react with a polyclonal antiserum raised against LtpTP-J 34 coded by phage TP-J 34. When 3 Bu 2 - 60 (pYAL 1) transformants were challenged with phages P 008 and P 001, 2 of them were partially resistant to phage P 001 but not to phage P 008. The 3 rd transformant was still sensitive to both phages. The deviation of phage resistance phenotypes observed in Bu 2 - 60 transformants harbouring the ltpTP- 778 or the ltpTP-J 34 gene was suggested to be due to the variability of one or more of the 10 amino acids that differ in the lipoproteins coded by ltpTP- 778 and ltpTP-J 34. Due to the high economical losses that may result from a phage infection of starter cultures, a rapid and sensitive method is required for phage detection and identification in the dairy. In Chapter 3, a rapid and reliable multiplex-PCR method is described allowing the simultaneous detection of S. thermophilus phages and their differentiation into the 2 well-known pac- and cos-type subgroups. Since pac- and cos-type phages are composed of different structural proteins, 2 sets of primers were designed from the internal highly conserved region of the major head protein gene of 8 completely sequenced S. thermophilus pac-type phages (TP-J 34, O 1205, Sfi 11, 2972) and cos-type phages (Sfi 21, 2701, Sfi 19, DT 1). The 2 primer sets could be used simultaneously in a multiplex PCR assay to detect and distinguish S. thermophilus phages, because the PCR-products differed in fragment size (432 -bp product for pac-type phages versus 514 -bp product of cos-type phages). The reliability of the multiplex PCR protocol was validated and confirmed by the following 3 controls: (I) restriction enzyme analysis of the DNA of cos- and pac-type DNA phages with and without a heating step at 74 °C required for the melting of fragments harbouring cos-sites, (II) SDS-PAGE analysis of the structural proteins of pac-type phages (3 major bands) and cos-type phages (2 major bands), and furthermore by (III) immuno electron microscopy of the phages treated with a polyclonal antiserum raised against the pac-type phage TP- 778. The multiplex PCR yielded results in a short time of approximately 2. 5 h. The method is highly sensitive with a limit of detection as low as ca. 103 phages per ml of acidic whey. The protocol was also used in a colony PCR approach to detect and identify 3 new lysogenic S. thermophilus strains harbouring inducible pac-type prophages within a set of 60 S. thermophilus strains isolated from <b>traditional</b> Egyptian <b>yoghurt</b> (Zabady) samples. When a number of newly isolated S. thermophilus phages was screened by the multiplex-PCR developed in Chapter 3, phage P 738 failed to deliver a PCR product. In order to confirm that this phage represents a new phage species for S. thermophilus phages, a detailed characterization was performed for this phage as described in Chapter 4. Phage P 738 was originally propagated on the well-described S. thermophilus strain S 4 but could also infect a set of 15 other S. thermophilus strains illustrating its broad host range. Notably, it was not possible to propagate phage P 738 lytically in liquid cultures at the standard incubation temperature of 40 °C used for these thermophilic cultures. Efficient cell lysis and phage proliferation was only possible at a lower temperature of 30 °C. Phage P 738 had a unique morphotype with an isometric head (57 nm ), a remarkably short, non-contractile tail (124 nm length x 10 nm ) and a distinct tail fiber (54 nm length). By SDS-PAGE analysis it was documented that phage P 738 revealed a distinct structural protein profile with one major protein band (33 kDa) and 5 minor protein bands (sizes: 50 kDa, 60 kDa, 72 kDa, 91 kDa, 150 kDa). By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme analysis, phage P 738 was identified as a pac-type phage with a genome size of ca. 35 kb. The P 738 DNA did neither hybridize with the DNA from other S. thermophilus reference phages (phages TP-J 34, TP- 778 L, P 53) nor with the|$|R

Aqueous and {{methanolic}} extracts were prepared from the dried peels, and their antioxidant activities [radical scavenging activity (RSA %), ABTS radical scavenging, total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) ] were determined. The aqueous extract of the dried whole peel showed the highest antioxidant activities {{as compared to}} other pomegranate peel extracts (PPEs). Stirred yoghurt was prepared from reconstituted skim milk powder fortified with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 % and 35 % of the PPE, before and after inoculation with the <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> starter. Addition of PPE before inoculation with the starter resulted in stirred yoghurt of higher antioxidant activities than that with PPE added after inoculation with the starter. Also, increasing {{the percentage of the}} added PPE increased significantly the antioxidant activities of stirred yoghurt up to 25 % and further increase in the percentage of added PPE led no significant effect. Addition of PPE had no significant effects on the sensory attributes (appearance, body & texture and flavor) as compared to the control sample. Increasing the percentage of the added PPE resulted in decrease in the viscosity of the stirred yoghurt, but samples containing 20 % and 25 % PPE led almost the same viscosity...|$|E

The {{main purpose of}} this research was to observe the influence of different levels of honey (5 %, 10 % and 15 % and 20 %) to yoghurt and its effect on viability of microbial flora of yoghurt, chemical and sensory characteristics. Honey set yoghurt mix was standardized to 3. 5 % fat, 12 % solid not fat and inoculated with 2 % culture. A different level (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 %) of honey was added to yoghurt milk. The samples of different treatments was analyzed for fat, protein, pH, acidity, total solid, moisture percent, viability on selective media (MRS & ST) and sensory characteristics (flavor and taste, colour and appearance, body and texture and overall acceptability). The data obtained on various parameters were statistically analyzed. Honey yoghurt was fermented with <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> culture, containing the strains of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus NCDC 074, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus NCDC 009. Supplementation of yoghurt with levels of honey affected the viability of probiotic bacteria. Thus it can be concluded that Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus viable counts increased with 10 % honey addition as compared to 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % honey. On the basis of chemical analysis treatment T 4 showed maximum value for acidity, total solids and moisture but lower value for fat and protein. Amongst all the samples, T 1 prepared from 5 % honey was rated best on sensory evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain milk like {{products}} from oats, an industrial process to manufacture a palatable, liquefied oat base has been developed (Lindahl et al 1994). This oat base per se has shown to be appreciated as a non-dairy milk alternative in the health market (Anon, 1999). It {{has also been shown}} {{that it is possible to}} obtain fermented oat milk with texture properties resembling that of <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> (Mårtensson et al 2001). In this study we have investigated the effects of fermented oat-based products containing both native and microbial -glucans, on plasma lipids and on faecal total bacterial count and Bifidobacterium ssp. Sixty-two volunteers (free-living subjects) with moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels were recruited. One of the oat products (ropy) was co-fermented with an exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing strain, Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6. A significant (p= 0. 022) reduction in total cholesterol by 6 % was observed in volunteers who had eaten the fermented, ropy oat-based product compared to the control group. A significant increase of total bacterial count (p= 0. 001) and Bifidobacterium ssp. (p= 0. 012) was observed in faecal samples from volunteers in the group who had eaten the fermented, ropy oat-based product. This study shows that a fermented, ropy oat-based product, containing both native and microbial glucans can reduce the cholesterol level and also stimulate the bifidobacteria flora in the gastrointestinal tract.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{probiotic}} culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus (La- 5), added solely or in co-culture with a starter culture of Streptococcus thermophilus, on texture, proteolysis and related properties of Minas fresh cheese during storage at 5 degrees C was investigated. Three cheese-making trials were prepared and produced with no addition of cultures (T 1 - control), supplemented with La- 5 (T 2), and with La- 5 + S. thermophilus (T 3). Viable counts of La- 5 remained above 6. 00 log cfu g(- 1) during the whole storage for T 2, reaching 7. 00 log cfu g(- 1) on the 14 th day. For T 3, the counts of La- 5 remained above 6. 00 log cfu g(- 1) after 7 days of storage. Due {{to the presence of}} S. thermophilus, T 3 presented the highest proteolytic index increase and titratable acidity values. Nevertheless, these results and S. thermophilus addition had no influence on viability of La- 5 which presented satisfactory populations for a probiotic food. Moreover, the use of a yoghurt culture for the production of Minas fresh cheese T 3 supplemented with La- 5 resulted in a good quality product, with a small rate of post-acidification, indicating that <b>traditional</b> <b>yoghurt</b> culture could be employed in co-culture with La- 5 {{to improve the quality of}} this cheese.
