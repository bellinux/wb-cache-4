50|$|A <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitor</b> (also, Transaction Processing Monitor or TP Monitor) is {{a control}} program that {{monitors}} {{the transfer of}} data between multiple local and remote terminals {{to ensure that the}} transaction processes completely or, if an error occurs, to take appropriate actions.|$|E
50|$|DUCS (Display Unit Control System) was a <b>{{teleprocessing}}</b> <b>monitor</b> from CFS Inc. It {{was one of}} two early local teleprocessing {{packages for}} IBM's DOS/VSE environment. DUCS provided an interface and access method for programmers to 'talk' to monitors. Such access methods later became known as APIs.|$|E
50|$|The Terminal Application Processing System, {{known as}} TAPS, {{had been created}} by a Midtown Manhattan-based firm named Decision Strategy Corporation, which was founded by Michael J. Parrella. Intended to {{significantly}} reduce the development time for online, CRT terminal-based applications, TAPS had been around since 1974 and initially ran on IBM mainframes under the CICS <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitor</b> and the TCAM access method.|$|E

50|$|<b>Teleprocessing</b> <b>monitors</b> were {{originally}} developed to allow several clients {{to connect to}} one server. However, they developed to what are now known as transaction processing monitors (TPMs). A TPM breaks down applications or code into transactions and ensures that all databases are updated in a single transaction. This is useful for airline reservations, car rentals, hotel accommodations, ATM transactions or other high volume transaction locations. TP monitors ensure that transactions are not lost or destroyed. Sometimes they {{are referred to as}} middleware, because the client sends the data for query or processing to the server database and then it is sent back to the user terminal. This can be accomplished remotely and by multiple users simultaneously. TP monitors are easily scalable allowing for increase in users and data processed.|$|R
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} monitor is {{an extremely}} complex software system crucial to the successful implementation of numerous computer applications. Any examination of telecommunications monitors will be somewhat incomplete due to the immense scope of the subject. There is a proliferation of telecommunications monitors available today, each having {{a tremendous amount of}} accompanying literature. To attempt to discuss all of the available systems, even in the most general of terms, would be ludicrous. The intent of this work is to provide a general introduction to the telecommunications monitor and its underlying concepts. This will be accomplished by examining, in general, a sampling of the various telecommunications monitors currently available on the market and, in some detail, IBM's CICS/VS system. The purpose of studying CICS/VS is to provide a background in the functioning and basic concepts of <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitors,</b> on which further study can be built in the future. The reason for selecting CICS/VS for detailed study is simples it is clearly the most widely used data communications monitor in use today, and will undoubtedly remain the industry standard well into the future. (1 : 70 E-M 91 - 02) This work introduces the basic concepts used by all telecommunications monitors and examines the actual implementation of these concepts. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
50|$|CIM {{continued}} to procure heavily-technical programming and consulting jobs and to sell GMT as a product. However, GMT {{was a tough}} product to sell to most executives {{because it was a}} very technical sale. Top management in many prospective companies usually did not have the technical knowledge to understand the requirements of a <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitor.</b> Consequently, CIM needed to find prospective sites with technically knowledgeable data processing (DP) managers or sites that gave significant executive power to their lead technicians.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s a Houston-based venture {{capitalist}} acquired {{a small group}} of companies which he named Information System Technologies (known as Insyte and pronounced “insight”). In 1974 Insyte acquired CIM’s promissory notes to gain control of CIM. Insyte replaced top management and made the decision to split the <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitor</b> from its key-driven access method and rename the two parts as Datacom/DC (for data communications) and Datacom/DB (for database). To emphasize the products’ relationship with Insyte, the company was renamed Insyte Datacom.|$|E
50|$|When CICS {{was first}} {{released}} by IBM {{in the late}} 1960s, it used IBM Assembler macros to generate the API system calls to the CICS <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>monitor</b> kernel. This was also true even if programs were written in COBOL or PL/1. Ken Dakin an independent programmer and CEO of APT Ltd. in the U.K., realized that by creating a middleware product, the problem could be solved for almost all situations. Ken Dakin approached IBM to market his product but received no interest at the time, {{despite the fact that}} tens of thousands of their clients application programs would need to be converted or rewritten for the new versions of CICS, costing many millions of dollars.|$|E
