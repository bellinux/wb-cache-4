40|$|Urban {{stormwater}} wetlands {{have been}} widely embraced by {{the community as a}} beneficial part of the stormwater infrastructure. This is in part due to their perceived benefits in terms of improving general ecosystem health, as well as the improvement <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> due to the presence of a semi-natural water body. The vegetation that is a dominant feature of these shallow ephemeral and perennial wetland systems {{plays an important role in}} the treatment of the stormwater within the system. Typically, artificial wetlands include a variety of vegetation types including those that are emergent, floating leaved attached, free floating and submerged.

40|$|Youth {{appreciation}} of volunteerism {{needs to be}} given attention if only because voluntary activities carried out without genuine {{appreciation of}} the volunteerism spirit does not really benefit the participants. This study evaluated the level of Malaysian youth appreciation {{of the spirit of}} volunteerism with respect to six appreciation constructs, namely, understanding, emotion, belief, practices, attitudes and motivation The study was conducted throughout the states in Peninsular Malaysia involving 500 randomly sampled youth aged between 15 and 30 and comprising all ethnic groups. Results of the statistical analysis showed that the level of Malaysian youth appreciation of the spirit of volunteerism was satisfactory except for the two parameters of emotion and motivation. In the case of emotion the study indicated the youth relative reluctance when volunteer programmes were located in areas suffering from diseases, unhygienic conditions and lacking <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> as <b>in</b> disaster areas. Yet, it was in such a situation that the keen spirit of volunteerism was most needed. This thus points to the imperative of improving the motivational side of youth volunteerism programmes in the country...|$|R

After Old Man Strong's plea is dismissed ("It's a Privilege to Pee"), he urinates on the street and is soon arrested by Officers Lockstock and Barrel and escorted off to Urinetown.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Bill Naito worked to {{convince}} others {{of his vision}} that downtown Portland could become a thriving, attractive place, if given attention and investment. [...] In addition to private property development, he believed that investment <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> was also {{a key part of}} that equation. [...] He was a strong proponent of building a light rail system in Portland when proposed in the 1970s—the MAX system which opened in 1986 and has expanded since—as well as other <b>public</b> transit investments <b>in</b> downtown, including the Portland Transit Mall, Fareless Square, Portland Vintage Trolley, and the Portland Streetcar. [...] He led a successful effort to plant more than 10,000 trees in the city, as founder of the Street Tree Advisory Committee, which became Portland's Urban Forestry Commission and which he chaired from 1976 until his death. [...] He donated space to start Portland's Saturday Market, a popular arts and crafts market that has been held in the Old Town/Chinatown district continuously since 1974. [...] He was co-founder and chairman of Artquake, an annual arts festival held in downtown from the 1980s until 1995. [...] He fought for adequate funding to keep Multnomah County's <b>public</b> libraries <b>in</b> operation.|$|R
40|$|Toronto is {{following}} the footsteps of populated urban cities like New York through the extrusion of skyscrapers, transforming Toronto {{into one of the}} densest cities in North America. Rapid development of residential density has produced a mono-centric core in which density is favoured over sustainable social neighbourhoods. This “gold rush” of condominium development has superseded the production of <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure to support the density added. Limited vacant lands, coupled with rising housing prices and the ever-increasing population, points to a potential crisis in which the long-term sustainability of these towers is questioned. Towers within the core {{can no longer afford to}} maintain the existing inflexible mono-culture, but must include <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure which supports the rapid density and diverse populous. The presence of the tower, soaring far beyond the ground plain, has further amplified the social and physical disconnect of the cities fabric and its inhabitants, while removing the responsibility from developers taking advantage of these trends. This thesis aims to investigate the production of tower “neighbourhoods” through the hybridization of vertical public and private spaces. The proposal aims to question the current high rise trends and limited <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure within the city and provide an alternative model for porous vertical neighbourhoods <b>in</b> which <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure is used to achieve social sustainability within Toronto’s core...|$|R

Purposive sampling method was utilized to collect data in Selangor and Kelang Vally, Malaysia. Data were collected through interview using a set of questionnaire and analyzed using the SPSS program.

50|$|Believed to {{have been}} first {{propagated}} in England in 1783, Dianella caerulea is commonly cultivated in gardens, and is sometimes seen as a low-hedging plant <b>in</b> <b>public</b> spaces and <b>amenities</b> plantings. It is very hardy and long-lived, and suitable for rockeries. It is tolerant of poor drainage and responds well to extra moisture. Plants attract fruit-eating birds and butterflies in garden settings. The smaller denser forms in particular have potential for small gardens.|$|R

Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945-51, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as <b>in</b> leisure and <b>public</b> <b>amenities.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the Agriculture Act 1947 established a more generous subsidy system for farmers. Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.|$|R

We have examined the determinants of urban poverty in Sargodha, a medium-size city of Pakistan. The analysis {{is based on the}} survey of 330 households. Results suggest that employment <b>in</b> <b>public</b> sector, investment <b>in</b> human capital and access to <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> reduce poverty while employment in informal sector, greater household size and female dominated households increase poverty.

Scoring was conducted on site, after taking photos and producing simple sketch diagrams in plan and section. Data reveals a correlation between Education and Recreation <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> (73 %). For each stormwater project neighborhood and site scale data are interpreted to affect the total score of <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> Drawing on technical, theoretical and city planning documents, this thesis exposes how stormwater management sites in Philadelphia function as <b>public</b> <b>amenities,</b> thereby informing the conceptual design process. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to acknowledge the support given by the Rutgers Department o...|$|R

40|$|Gross Floor Area (GFA) {{concession}} scheme, as {{a planning}} incentive, is {{developed from the}} notion of “make developers pay” in UK in 1990. It rewards developers additional GFA <b>in</b> exchange for <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> so that government could save that amount of money. This paper carries out a review of GFA concession scheme in Hong Kong and Singapore to synergize the key features and success factors of its implementation. Reasons for its effectiveness were discussed {{from the perspective of}} political, economical, and business issues. Based on case studies, the key features of “Floor Area Concession Schemes” are discussed, including 1) very effective in places with high land value; 2) influencing built environment positively and negatively; 3) ensuring the buildings get certified by green building (GB) rating system. This paper identifies key success factors, comprising 1) common goal but different interests shared by developers and governments; 2) a bonus cap; 3) regular review and revision of the scheme; 4) links between planning objectives and GB technology and design practice, which will be discussed. These help formulate a general approach or model of “Floor Area Concession Schemes” for promoting green building. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
