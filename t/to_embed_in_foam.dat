50|$|Heleioporus albopunctatus has {{terrestrial}} egg deposition. Males excavate burrows up to 1 m deep {{in sandy}} substrates surrounding ephemeral waterbodies, and commence calling in autumn (March/April). Amplexus (mating) {{occurs in the}} burrow and females deposit a clutch of eggs <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>foam,</b> <b>in</b> a chamber {{at the base of}} the burrow. Eggs develop to mid-stage tadpoles within the eggs, but final development is dependent on winter rains filling the waterbody and flooding burrows. Tadpoles then hatch and complete development in the pond.|$|R

40|$|Foam Z-pinch {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} on the SATURN and Z machines at Sandia National Laboratories to study physics issues related to x-ray radiation generation and inertial confinement fusion. A significant issue for foam Z-pinch experiments is the transparency of the heated foam {{as a function of}} time and wavelength. Foam transparency will be important <b>in</b> future <b>foam</b> Z-pinch experiments both because it influences the time-dependent radiation field seen by an ICF capsule <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> the <b>foam,</b> and because it {{is an important factor in}} making high-resolution spectral measurements of a capsule or tracers <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> the <b>foam.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, the authors describe results from simulations and experiments which address the issue of foam transparency. They discuss imaging data from one Z experiment in which x-ray emission from a half-Au/half-CH disk located at the bottom of a 1 cm-tall, 14 mg/cc TPX foam is observed. Simulation results predicting CH foam optical depths as a function of plasma conditions are presented. In addition, the authors present results from spectral calculations which utilize 2 -D MHD simulation predictions for the time-dependent foam conditions. The results indicate that the observed x-ray framing camera images are consistent with early-time (several ns prior to stagnation) foam electron temperatures of {approx_gt} 30 eV, which is somewhat hotter than the foam electron temperatures predicted from the 2 -D MHD simulations at early times...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} conditions for an op-erator PBTA commuting with the compression SB of the standard unilateral shift on the Hardy space to a shift coinvariant subspace <b>to</b> <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> a C 0 -semigroup of operators commuting with SB. For B an interpolating Blaschke product, a necessary and sufficient con-dition is that a symbol A of the operator PBTA and B have no common zeros (see Lemma 3). The condition is shown to be necessary for an arbitrary inner function B (see Lemma 1), but not sufficient for any interpolating Blaschke product (see Theorem 2). For B an interpolating Blaschke product, necessary and sufficient con-ditions are given for an operator commuting with SB <b>to</b> <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> a C 0 - semigroup of operators commuting with SB consisting entirely of con-traction operators using the Nevanlinna- Pick Interpolation Theorem (see Theorem 1). 1...|$|R
