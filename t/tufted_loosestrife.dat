5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (<b>tufted</b> <b>loosestrife)</b> and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the <b>tufted</b> <b>loosestrife</b> (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
50|$|One rare species, <b>Tufted</b> <b>Loosestrife</b> (Lysimachia thyrsiflora) is also {{associated}} with the community.|$|E
50|$|Lysimachia thyrsiflora, {{commonly}} known as <b>tufted</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> is a plant in the genus Lysimachia. It is native to large sections of the northern Northern Hemisphere, including Eurasia and North America. It often grows in marshes, shorelines of lakes and ponds and occasionally along streams. It is an erect perennial herb growing up to 80 centimeters tall and bearing yellow flowers, sometimes dotted with purple. It may be confused with purple loosestrife when not blooming but can be easily distinguished because purple loosestrife has a square stem. <b>Tufted</b> <b>loosestrife</b> has been used medicinally in Asia to combat high blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|The red-listed Myrica gale, {{which is}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, grows on the pond embankments. Other plants that grow here, {{including}} some protected species, are the: white water-lily, downy birch, water soldier, woody nightshade, flatleaf bladderwort, small bur-reed, <b>tufted</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> sneezewort, branched bur-reed, cowbane (very poisonous), six-stamened waterwort, yellow flag, Eupatorium.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{surrounded}} with woods consisting mainly of spruces, which are replaced with mountain pines towards the centre. The meadows are very rich in species of various plants. Among {{the most common}} ones there are horsetails, wood club-rush, Cirsium rivulare and meadowsweet. There are {{also a lot of}} rare species, such as few-flower sedge, fibrous tussock-sedge, flea sedge, <b>tufted</b> <b>loosestrife</b> or Gladiolus imbricatus.|$|E
50|$|The loch is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1975 {{and many}} {{interesting}} plant species, including Greater Bladderwort, Lesser Pond Sedge, <b>Tufted</b> <b>Loosestrife,</b> and the nationally rare Cowbane have been recorded. Breeding birds include Snipe, Water Rail, Grasshopper Warbler, and Reed Bunting. The countryside around Ashgrove Loch is amongst the richest in the area; the fields attract flocks of Chaffinch, Reed Bunting, Yellowhammer, and Tree Sparrow.|$|E
