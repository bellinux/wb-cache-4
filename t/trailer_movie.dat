40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} televised <b>movie</b> <b>trailers</b> that included images of tobacco use during 1 year {{and the extent of}} youth exposure to those trailers. DESIGN: Content analysis combined with Nielsen data measuring media exposure. All <b>movie</b> <b>trailers</b> (N = 216) shown on television from August 1, 2001, through July 31, 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure among youth aged 12 to 17 years to televised <b>movie</b> <b>trailers</b> that included smoking imagery. RESULTS: Of the <b>movie</b> <b>trailers</b> televised during the study period, 14. 4 % (31 trailers) included images of tobacco use. Tobacco use was shown in 24. 0 % of the 23 trailers for R-rated (restricted) movies and 7. 5 % of the 8 trailers for PG- 13 - and PG-rated (parental guidance) movies. Ninety-five percent of all youth aged 12 to 17 years in the United States saw at least 1 <b>movie</b> <b>trailer</b> depicting tobacco use on television during this 1 year, and 88. 8 % saw at least 1 of these trailers 3 or more times.
