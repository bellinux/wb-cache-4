2500|$|...Callaway Golf {{introduces}} the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> to increase forgiveness {{and ease of}} launch.|$|E
2500|$|Golf {{clubs have}} {{traditionally}} been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively [...] "open" [...] lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or [...] "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to , or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used {{for a variety of}} shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{shaft length}} of an iron {{decreases}} as the iron's number increases; therefore the iron number is inversely proportionate to its length. This reduced length {{means that a}} <b>clubhead</b> of <b>the</b> same mass traveling at the same angular velocity (degrees per second, as swung by a golfer) has lower momentum because <b>the</b> <b>clubhead's</b> speed is slower. To combat this, higher-numbered iron clubheads are heavier than lower-numbered iron heads; there is generally a 1/4 oz. (7g) increase in mass between one <b>clubhead</b> and <b>the</b> next higher number.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clubheads</b> usually {{approach}} <b>the</b> 460 {{cubic centimeter}} limit, rarely below 400 cc. They must {{stay within the}} Coefficient Of Restitution (COR) limit of 0.83, which measures how a ball hits off <b>the</b> surface. Most <b>clubheads</b> only approach <b>the</b> COR {{in the center of}} the club, so technology has allowed more area of the club to possess a COR of above 0.80. Thus, mishits are less affected by <b>the</b> newer <b>clubheads.</b> <b>The</b> loft of a long drive club is also much lower than a consumer club, sometimes around 4 or 5 degrees, as opposed to 10.5 degrees for an amateur's driver. The reason for lower lofted driver heads is to greatly reduce back spin. Too much back spin causes the ball to balloon or climb, creating a steep landing angle which does not allow the ball roll out. A flatter landing angle is desired to get the most out of the ball's forward velocity and energy.|$|R
5000|$|Although most irons are now {{produced}} by investment casting, many high end iron sets are still {{produced by}} forging, as <b>the</b> resulting <b>clubhead</b> {{is easier to}} adjust by bending to adapt the set to a player's specific needs. The resulting club is also generally thought to have an improved [...] "feel" [...] due to the softer consistency of the forged metal as opposed to cast.|$|R
5000|$|Ping is {{so intent}} on custom fitting that it began {{manufacturing}} some iron clubheads with a small notch in <b>the</b> <b>clubhead.</b> The notch allows <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> to be bent to the required specification without the danger of breaking <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> as was the problem for previous models.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} factors that {{influence}} the amount of side-spin imparted to a golf ball during impact with a driver. In general, the best golf drives are launched with minimal side-spin, producing a straight ball trajectory with maximum carry distance. During off-centre impacts, side-spin is generated due to a phenomenon known as the “gear effect. ” The extent of the gear effect depends on clubhead design parameters such as the moment of inertia and centre of gravity location. The bulge of a driver is a design feature implemented to counter-act the side-spin produced by the gear effect. In this investigation, an impulse-momentum impact model and an aerodynamic ball flight model are used to (i) {{examine the effect of}} the centre of gravity depth (distance from clubface) on ball trajectory during off-centre impacts, (ii) test the efficacy of movable weight technology, and (iii) optimize the bulge radius in relation to <b>the</b> <b>clubhead's</b> centre of gravity depth and moment of inertia. In the first study, it is qualitatively shown that side-spin increases linearly with increasing centre of gravity depth. In the second study, it is found that movable weights can {{have a significant effect on}} ball trajectory, especially at higher swing speeds. In the third study, a relationship between the bulge radius, centre of gravity depth, and moment of inertia is developed, and an equation for calculating the optimum bulge radius is fit to the simulation results...|$|R
25|$|In 1986, Callaway hired a {{billiard cue}} {{designer}}, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter later became chief club designer {{that same year}} and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and that of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel <b>clubhead.</b> <b>The</b> Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Traditional woods had a {{very thick}} hosel, often wrapped with thin cord, which {{provided}} a very secure joint between shaft and head {{at the cost of}} a higher center of gravity. Modern metalwoods have largely done away with the hosel altogether, instead anchoring the shaft within <b>the</b> <b>clubhead.</b> This allows as much mass as possible to be contained in <b>the</b> <b>clubhead,</b> lowering the center of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|Sidespin is {{imparted}} {{due to the}} non-perpendicularity of {{the golf}} club or the path of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A fat shot {{occurs when}} the forward edge of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> strikes the ground behind the ball first, causing the shot to come up short of the target.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubhead</b> covers protect <b>the</b> clubs from {{striking}} {{each other}} and from weather and incidental damage while in the bag, make clubs more identifiable at a glance, and provide a personal touch to a player's clubs. <b>The</b> most common <b>clubhead</b> covers are for a player's driver and fairway woods, as modern designs have large hollow heads and long shafts that make them prone to damage, but covers for hybrids, putters, and even irons/wedges are also marketed.|$|R
50|$|It would {{therefore}} also appear that {{only two things}} are important in any backswing instructions, First, that <b>the</b> racket or <b>clubhead</b> pauses in <b>the</b> correct place on the desired swing arc and plane {{as determined by the}} intended 'shot', and secondly, that the racket or club face has assumed the optimal angle relative to swing arc and plane, so as to require minimal further adjustment in the Final Swing Sequence, and thereby eliminating another adjustment variable and potential cause of error.|$|R
40|$|Golf is {{enjoyed by}} people of all ages. The ability {{to hit the ball}} long {{distances}} generally declines with age. This study examines how age affects the ability of 40 recreational golfers (age 20 to 59 years) to generate maximum <b>clubhead</b> speed. <b>The</b> study also investigates how centre of pressure (CP) movement in the golf swing contributes to maximum cluhead speed. The results show that golfers between ages of 20 to 39 years produce <b>the</b> fastest <b>clubhead</b> speeds. <b>The</b> range of CP movement between the feet, maximum displacement of the CP on the front foot (medial/lateral movement) and the maximum CP velocity all correlate with a faster clubhead speed. These factors were also correlated with age, indicating an increase in age leads to a decreases in each of the CP parameters, which in turn correlates with the a decrease in clubhead speed...|$|R
5000|$|Cavity back, or {{perimeter}} weighted, irons {{are usually}} made by investment casting, which creates a harder metal allowing thinner surfaces while retaining durability, and {{also allows for}} more precise placement of metal than forging techniques. Cavity backs are so called because of the cavity created {{in the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> due to the removal of metal {{from the center of the}} clubhead's back, which is then redistributed, most of it very low and towards the toe and heel of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead.</b> This has the general effect of lowering the clubhead's center of mass, placing it underneath that of the ball allowing for a higher launch angle for a given loft. The perimeter weighting also increases the moment of inertia, making <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> more resistant to twisting on impact with the ball. The end result is a clubhead with a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] that is more forgiving of slight mis-hits.|$|E
5000|$|... 1988-Callaway Golf {{introduces}} the S2H2 iron. It features a significantly shorter hosel than conventional irons; the weight saved from making the hosel shorter is relocated low in <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> to increase forgiveness {{and ease of}} launch.|$|E
5000|$|A thin shot {{occurs when}} the forward edge of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> strikes the ball too high, causing the shot to fly low, {{sometimes}} even causing it to travel across the ground, and usually comes up short of the target.|$|E
5000|$|For many players, long irons (numbers 1-4) are {{difficult}} to hit well even with modern clubfaces, due to the low trajectory and very small face of <b>the</b> low-loft <b>clubhead.</b> Players tend to avoid these clubs in favor of fairway woods which have a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] to hit with, but such woods, having longer shafts, have a different swing mechanic that is sometimes difficult to master. The long shaft of a fairway wood also requires lots of room to swing, making it unsuitable for tighter lies such as [...] "punching" [...] out from underneath trees. In addition, the fairway wood clubface is designed to skim over instead of cutting into turf, which makes it undesirable for shots from the rough. The answer to this dilemma for many players is to replace the 1-4 irons with hybrids.|$|R
5000|$|The 8 and 9 irons are {{commonly}} called the [...] "short irons". They have <b>the</b> highest-mass <b>clubheads</b> and <b>the</b> shortest shafts of the numbered irons, {{and are used}} for shots requiring high loft and/or moderate to short distance (typically between 130 and 150 yards with a full swing). Shots that must carry over tall and/or nearby obstacles such as a stand of trees, or approach shots from inside 140 yards of the pin, are common short iron situations. The short irons also make good [...] "bump and run" [...] clubs; used with a putting motion from the fringe around the green, the ball will carry in the air a few yards over the thick grass that would hamper a putt, then land softly on the green where it will then roll for a distance like a putt.|$|R
50|$|The short irons are {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} easiest to hit; however they are typically used in situations requiring very high accuracy, and so it becomes critical to minimize any effect of mis-hits. Short irons are often constructed using steel shafts, even if lower-lofted irons in the set have graphite; <b>the</b> steel minimizes <b>clubhead</b> torquing, increasing <b>the</b> consistency and thus accuracy of shots made {{at the cost of}} reduced flex which reduces distance (a secondary concern in most situations where these irons are used).|$|R
5000|$|On off-center hits, <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> twists as {{a result}} of a torque, {{reducing}} accuracy as the face of the club is not square to the player's stance at impact. In recent years, many manufacturers have produced and marketed many low-torque shafts aimed at reducing the twisting of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> at impact, however these tend to be stiffer along their length as well. Most recently, many brands have introduced stiff-tip shafts. These shafts offer the same flex throughout most of the shaft, in order to attain the [...] "whip" [...] required to propel the ball properly, but also include a stiffer tip, which cuts back drastically on the lateral torque acting on the head.|$|E
5000|$|Wedges are a {{subclass}} of irons {{with higher}} loft than numbered irons, {{used for a}} variety of specialized [...] "utility" [...] shots that require short distance (typically less than 130 yards), high launch angle, and/or high backspin to reduce roll distance. The first wedge to have that name was the sand wedge, invented by Gene Sarazen in 1931, which features a wide sole that is angled complementary to the striking face to help prevent <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> digging into soft turf such as sand. This wide sole was added to other high-lofted irons to add mass to <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> (compensating for the shorter shafts) and gives wedges their name, alluding to the clubs' appearance in profile.|$|E
5000|$|With {{such high}} {{emphasis}} on drive distance and accuracy by players wanting to [...] "play like the pros", {{a large amount}} of customization is available in drivers in order to provide the club configuration that best matches the player's specific swing mechanics. Club-makers generally provide for selection and/or customization of five things: the shaft flex, which determines how energy is stored and released during the player's swing; the loft angle, which is a determinant of launch angle and backspin; the offset, which determines the angle the clubface will have to the ball at impact; <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> mass, which can [...] "fine-tune" [...] <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> behaviour for a player's swing tempo; and the centre of mass, which is also a factor in launch angle and backspin.|$|E
50|$|Widely {{overlooked}} {{as a part}} of the club, {{the shaft}} is considered by many to be the transmission of <b>the</b> modern <b>clubhead.</b> Shafts range in price from a mere $20 to over $1200. Current graphite shafts weigh considerably less than their steel counterparts, (sometimes weighing less than 50 grams for a driver shaft) allowing for lighter clubs that can be swung at greater speed. Within the last ten years, performance shafts have been integrated into the club making process. Performance shafts are designed to address specific criteria, such as to launch the ball higher or lower or to adjust for the timing of a player's swing to load and unload the shaft at the correct moments of the swing for maximum power. Whereas in the past each club could come with only one shaft, today's clubheads can be fit with dozens of different shafts, creating the potential for a much better fit for the average golfer.|$|R
5000|$|The ball moved {{only two}} or three feet. Shepard also stated that the second ball went [...] "miles and miles and miles" [...] (off-camera of the {{television}} broadcast), which was clearly a joke, like the comment about the slice. Later, in an interview, Shepard said, [...] "Then I thought, with <b>the</b> same <b>clubhead</b> speed, <b>the</b> ball's going to go at least six times as far. There's absolutely no drag, so if you do happen to spin it, it won't slice or hook 'cause there's no atmosphere to make it turn." [...] A slice comes from hitting the ball off the outer end of the club-head, versus hitting it square {{in the middle of the}} club-head, versus hooking it, which is hitting it off the inner end of the club-head. Shepard did, in effect, [...] "slice" [...] the ball at first, and as he notes, being in the virtually non-existent lunar atmosphere, the ball did not curve laterally as an earthbound slice would.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, groove {{technology}} {{has changed the}} playability of irons. For the past 80 years, little has changed about grooves. However, a new rule by the USGA and the R&A has changed the way that grooves are to be made starting in 2010. In general, the deeper the groove, the more grass can be dispersed behind the ball at impact. This allows control over the amount of spin, which is crucial to flight characteristics of the shot {{as well as how}} well received the ball is on the green. The less that is between the ball and the club at impact, the more spin that will be produced which increases the flight trajectory and allows stopping quicker upon hitting the green. Better players benefit the most from deep, sharp grooves as <b>the</b> more <b>clubhead</b> speed is generated, the more spin the player is able to introduce. By forcing manufacturers to lessen the depth and cut on the grooves, the new rules will penalize shots from longer grass slightly more and put a premium on hitting the fairway.|$|R
5000|$|A punch or {{knock-down}} shot is {{one with}} a low trajectory, that is employed when hitting into the wind or {{in order to avoid}} hitting the ball into overhead obstructions. This stroke is achieved by keeping the weight forward and the hands ahead of <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> through impact.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterward, however, Legrange {{suffered}} a severe loss {{of confidence in}} his backswing, and would often refuse to complete a shot, stepping away from the ball even after taking <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> away from the ball. Naturally, his form tailed off, and he would win only two minor events in South Africa in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The modern sand wedge still {{uses the}} ideas of high mass, high loft, and bounce angle, but the modern sand wedge clubhead has much higher mass than earlier designs, up to 40oz (2.5 lb, 1.13 kg), to drive <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> through the firmer sand found in many courses. There can also be {{differences}} in shaft length; while some sand wedges follow the systematic progression of shorter shaft lengths for higher lofts, many sand wedges are longer than the adjacent lofted wedges. This encourages the player to hit sand wedge shots [...] "fat" [...] (the club hits the ground before the ball), which on a firm lie is generally bad, {{but in the case}} of a ball embedded or buried in soft bunker sand this will get <b>the</b> <b>clubhead</b> all the way under the ball to lift it out. The resulting plume of sand from such a shot was made famous by Sarazen as the [...] "explosion shot" [...] and is a common sight in televised golf events.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{these same}} {{forgiving}} characteristics can make game improvement irons harder for a skilled golfer to use well. The {{tendency of the}} clubs to correct mis-hits will frustrate a golfer's attempts to intentionally hit a curved shot (a [...] "fade" [...] or [...] "draw"), for instance to avoid an obstacle lying along a straight flight path, or to counter a rightward or leftward slope to the fairway {{that would make a}} straight shot roll into the rough. This lack of ability to [...] "work the ball" [...] can frustrate a more skilled golfer attempting to place the ball more accurately on the fairway than a novice would normally be concerned with (the novice's primary concern being simply to keep the ball on the fairway in the first place). <b>The</b> increased <b>clubhead</b> mass and lower center of mass can also be incompatible with a more skilled player's stronger swing; the higher mass reduces <b>clubhead</b> speed, while <b>the</b> higher launch angle causes more backspin and wastes the golfer's energy sending the ball up into the air instead of out over the fairway.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (i) to {{determine}} whether significant three-dimensional (3 D) trunk kinematic differences existed between a driver and a five-iron during a golf swing; and (ii) to determine the anthropometric, physiological, and trunk kinematic variables associated with clubhead speed. Trunk range of motion and golf swing kinematic data were collected from 15 low-handicap male golfers (handicap = 2. 5 ± 1. 9). Data were collected using a 10 -camera motion capture system operating at 250 Hz. Data on clubhead speed and ball velocity were collected using a real-time launch monitor. Paired t-tests revealed nine significant (p ≤ 0. 0019) between-club differences for golf swing kinematics, namely trunk and lower trunk flexion/extension and lower trunk axial rotation. Multiple regression analyses explained 33. 7 - 66. 7 % of <b>the</b> variance in <b>clubhead</b> speed for <b>the</b> driver and five-iron, respectively, with both trunk and lower trunk variables showing associations with clubhead speed. Future studies should consider the role of the upper limbs and modifiable features of the golf club in developing <b>clubhead</b> speed for <b>the</b> driver in particular...|$|R
50|$|A hybrid with a wood-like clubhead {{is often}} used for long shots from {{difficult}} rough and for nearly any shot where the golfer would normally use a long iron but feels uncomfortable doing so. They also are direct replacements for fairway woods in most situations, but a fairway wood will have greater club speed and more roll for better distance. Because hybrids can assist in getting the player out of tricky situations such as tight lies, TaylorMade Golf chose to market their hybrid clubs as Rescue clubs. The most common hybrid lofts are 3-iron and 4-iron equivalents (the 1- and 2-iron are usually omitted from the bag completely), though 5-iron equivalents are also seen in ladies' and seniors' sets. Hybrids generally replace rather than supplement long irons, but as a player is free to carry any set of 14 clubs that they wish, it is not unheard of for a player to carry both a 3-hybrid and a 3-iron, with the hybrid instead replacing the fairway wood; <b>the</b> higher-mass iron <b>clubhead</b> would be preferable to the hybrid for use in tall grass or soft lies.|$|R
