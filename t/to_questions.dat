30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{different}} test formats, no {{significant difference was found}} among the three types examined here. There is only one example that shows that differences in test format might affect students’ performance. In Conversation 2 of Test 4, the percentage of correct answers <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 2 was low in Classes 1 and 3 (25.0  % in Class 1 and 35.0  % in Class 3) but relatively high in Class 2 (65.0  %), while in Question 1, the results were completely opposite: The percentage of correct answers was higher in Classes 1 and 3 (75.0  % in Class 1 and 70.0  % in Class 3) than in Class 2 (65.0  %). A possible {{reason for this is that}} the key words <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 2 appear before the key words <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 1. The students in Classes 1 and 3 managed to catch the key words <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 1, but missed those <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 2. In the case of Class 2, the students listened <b>to</b> the three <b>questions</b> in both English and their L 1 before listening to the spoken text. However, the students in Class 1 did not read or listen <b>to</b> the <b>questions</b> prior <b>to</b> listening to the text, and those in Class 3 were allowed <b>to</b> read the <b>questions</b> but were not told to read all three questions beforehand. As a result, they might have concentrated on Question 1, and thus missed the key words <b>to</b> <b>Question</b> 2. Except for this case, differences in students’ test performance among three classes were statistically insignificant.|$|R

5|$|Newspaper writers {{initially}} performed {{this function}} {{in the early days}} of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.|$|E
