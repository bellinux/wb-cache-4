5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|Bite force {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> force of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E
50|$|Degmacytes usually appear {{smaller than}} a normal red blood cell due to <b>the</b> <b>bites.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bites</b> are usually shaped like a semi-circle, but may also be irregular.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} smaller mandibles {{and need to}} chew through {{decaying}} wood to lay eggs, females {{are thought to have}} a greater biting force. However, contrary to popular belief, <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force of <b>the</b> male mandibles can in fact exceed <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force of <b>the</b> females, for example, <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force of Cyclommatus metallifer males was found to 3 times that of females.|$|R

A friend of hers, Dr. Allan Pang (a dental expert)is {{examining}} <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> on <b>the</b> victims. After reviewing <b>the</b> <b>bites,</b> he deduces that <b>the</b> man was <b>bitten</b> and mauled by a tiger and <b>the</b> girl was <b>bitten</b> by humans.|$|R
5|$|The Great Plague {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The plague {{was caused by the}} Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> of an infected rat flea.|$|E

5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> marks were made in a carcass. As <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
50|$|Obsessive: This type is when <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> and yanking is repeated. Again, the {{response}} is avoidance behavior. The wounds are more severe and include partial or full amputation. To prevent, separate <b>the</b> <b>bitten</b> and victim pigs and treat the injured pigs.|$|R

5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived <b>the</b> <b>bite.</b> A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

50|$|Until 1955, {{the only}} {{antivenom}} available for general distribution for Australian snakes was the monovalent (specific) tiger snake (Notechis) antivenom, which gave {{varying degrees of}} cross-protection against <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> of most other dangerous Australian snakes. Thereafter followed specific anti-venom for other common snakes among them the coastal taipan, and finally, a polyvalent (broad spectrum) antivenom, a combined antivenom for <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> of any unidentified snake from Australia.|$|R
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|Among Seattle's {{prominent}} annual {{fairs and}} festivals are the 24-day Seattle International Film Festival, Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout July and August (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to the Seafair Cup hydroplane races), <b>the</b> <b>Bite</b> of Seattle, {{one of the}} largest Gay Pride festivals in the United States, and the art and music festival Bumbershoot, which programs music as well as other art and entertainment over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by 100,000people annually, as are the Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
40|$|For {{the human}} tooth implant, the various designs of {{artificial}} metal tooth roots {{have been used}} widely. The lower jaw ordinary moves {{much more than the}} upper jaw at <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> action, and <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force distribution in the mandible implanted a tooth root decides if the implant works for a long period or not. Then, {{it is very important to}} implant a tooth root so that <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force in mandible will be distributed as closely as possible to those of the natural tooth and mandible combination. <b>The</b> actual <b>biting</b> force distribution in mandible of a person can never be obtained and we employed a two-dimensional FEM model of a tooth and its underneath mandible section. This model consists of following eight parts; a natural tooth, cortical bone I and II, bone trabeculae, newly grown bone, soft materials, dental canal, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Young's modulus (E) and poisson's ratio (ν) for some of the above parts are quoted from the literatures and those for the rest of them are postulated here. The FEM approximate solutions of <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force distribution for three examples of the center incisor, the second premolar and the second molar are shown in the text. The FEM approximate solutions for the three different designs of the artificial metal tooth roots implanted into mandible are also reported. The tooth roots obviously concentrate <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> stress at around the neck of the cortical bone I and at around the downward contact point of cortical bone II. The volume and the distribution of the newly grown bones in mandible after operation affect <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> stress distribution. <b>The</b> design of the tooth roots used and the way to implant them also effect the stress distribution. The analyzed data is reported here in detail, and the comparison and the discussion on them are given...|$|R
30|$|The {{composition}} of KRAIT (Bungarus faciatus) venom is essentially neurotoxic. Symptoms develop very rapidly and most often <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> are painless and marks are {{invisible in the}} body. Earlier works have reported significant clinical and autopsy changes in <b>the</b> Krait <b>bite</b> fatalities.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bites</b> are not life-threatening, {{but a few}} {{individuals}} suffering 100 or more bites have undergone brief hospitalizations.|$|R
5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
