The questionnaire contained a combination of true/false questions, Likert-type scale questions, a checklist of student characteristics, open-ended questions, and a final section on demographics.

Results indicated <b>that</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> were knowledgeable about the relationship between JROTC and the military.
