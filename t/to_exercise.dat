30|$|In summary, all the {{findings}} of the present study, including cortisol and ACTH responses to ITT and salivary cortisol 30  min after awakening, seemed to be positive adaptions <b>to</b> <b>exercises</b> in healthy athletes (in the absence of OTS) that helped improve sport-specific performance, and for some reason, this hormonal conditioning (which were the positive adaptions <b>to</b> <b>exercises)</b> was at least partially lost in OTS, which may explain the decrease in performance in OTS.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a decision-maker for purpose A, it is unlawful for the decision-maker <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> the power for purpose B, because the decision-maker would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> power in breach of these fundamental rules or <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf was {{the last}} of a series of Mercian kings, {{beginning}} with Penda in the early 7th century, <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> dominance over most or all of southern England.

5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a collapse {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E
5|$|Following Greece, the {{headquarters}} of I Corps returned to Palestine. Wells was made General Staff Officer, 2nd Grade (GSO2), the {{deputy chief of staff}} in charge of planning operations. I Corps was alerted {{to take part in the}} Syria-Lebanon Campaign, in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command, the corps lacked a commanding officer. General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson—the British commander in Palestine and Transjordan—believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset. Instead, Wilson attempted <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> command from the King David Hotel. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> the close command required. Following a series of reverses, I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command that day. The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation, with almost all reserves committed. Lavarack began regrouping his force, concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards Beirut. Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Foreign states {{generally}} enjoy {{immunity from}} lawsuits in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).
