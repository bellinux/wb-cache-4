5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other states}} that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour {{combinations}} from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led {{to the use of}} the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.|$|E

25|$|In the {{category}} of rings, Ring, the inclusion map Z → Q is a non-surjective epimorphism; to see this, note that any ring homomorphism on Q is determined entirely by its action on Z, similar to the previous example. A similar argument shows that the natural ring homomorphism from any commutative ring R <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its localizations is an epimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Though Urbano's wives bore him no {{legitimate}} male heirs, Urbano fathered a son, Maffeo Callisto Barberini in 1688 prior <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{his three}} marriages. The will of Urbano Barberini's last wife, Maria Teresa Boncompagni, makes mention of this Maffeo Callisto as the Marquis of Corese. A {{large portion of}} the Barberini estate was left for him in her will.|$|E

These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered {{in combination with other}} strategies, such as a later liver transplantation. Generally, these treatment procedures are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies, such as microwave or cryoablation, or arterial catheter-based therapies, such as chemoembolization and radioembolization.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{and game}} mechanics {{fall into the}} subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones. As such, Montana can commandeer vehicles (cars and boats), can move around the map on foot, can interact with civilians and NPCs both hostile and non-hostile, can engage in primary and sub-missions, and can wield a variety of weaponry; pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, a chainsaw, and various melee weapons, such as pipes and machetes. In a departure from most Grand Theft Auto-style games, Montana cannot kill innocent people. If the player tries to shoot a non-aggressive target, Montana will refuse; if the player tries to hit an innocent person with a car, they will only be injured. However, as the game progresses, the player acquires access to some of Montana's employees; a driver, a boat pilot, a weapons dealer, an enforcer and an assassin. When these employees have been unlocked, the player can switch control from Montana <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them (except the weapons dealer), and when playing as the enforcer or the assassin, the player can kill innocent people.|$|E
500|$|The {{institution}} of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. [...] "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially {{in relation to the}} conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Mail proprietor, Alfred Harmsworth, publicised {{efforts to}} help {{soldiers}} and their families. This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are at your service. ... turn [...] over <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a portion of your contribution.

[...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E
