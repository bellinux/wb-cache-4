5|$|In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten {{was invited}} to a job {{interview}} by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark.

5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E

5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. <b>The</b> <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{spent her}} days writing; her main project {{was a book}} about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also {{maintained}} an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary {{as part of the}} Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.|$|E
5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved no credit, that <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E

5|$|The British {{television}} {{premiere of}} the video was extremely controversial. The video had not been ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By {{the time it was}} finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere the video on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air the video two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. <b>The</b> <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of the video and the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree to appear to promote the video in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot {{to make way for the}} video and McCartney. The airing of the video on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.|$|E

30|$|Data {{collection}} included 28 semi-structured, face-to-face <b>interviews</b> {{conducted in}} <b>the</b> communities of Marujá and Cananéia.
