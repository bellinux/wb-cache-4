It becomes very small so that the sample's increase in temperature for a given heat input may be relatively large. This makes it practical to make a calorimeter that has a very large <b>temperature</b> <b>excursion</b> for {{a small amount of}} heat input, such as that deposited by a passing particle. The temperature rise can be measured with a standard type of thermistor, as in a classical calorimeter. In general, small sample size and very sensitive thermistors are required to make a sensitive particle detector by this method.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{distribution}} process one should monitor that process until one builds a sufficient data set that clearly demonstrates {{the process is}} in compliance and {{in a state of}} control. Each time the process does not conform to the process, the event should be properly documented, investigated and corrected so that the <b>temperature</b> <b>excursion</b> do not occur on future shipments. Any anomaly is thus considered to be a Non Conformance and should be assigned as a trackable event. The event must be reported immediately when it is identified and it is the expectation of the FDA that all adverse events be documented and investigated. The investigation should be completed in a timely manner and must come to some form of a [...] "root cause" [...] and also some form of [...] "corrective action". The system may potentially stay in a Validated state if the root cause identifies that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was not followed or followed incorrectly. If however a SOP needs to be changed or modified, then the system must be re-validated to demonstrate that the change to the SOP maintains the integrity of the process/system. A Non-Conformance may also generate a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA), again, a documented process to make corrective or preventative actions to SOP's and other documents.|$|E

Each pharmaceutical product should be handled and stored under specified storage condition labelled on product information data sheet or product pack. Hence the temperature excursions during receipt of raw materials, manufacturing {{of pharmaceutical}} products and distribution should be managed during entire product life cycle with holistic approach.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in {{construction of a}} large telescope on the lunar surface (Nein and Davis, 1991; Bely, Burrows, and Illingworth, 1989) has prompted this feasibility study of a thermal control system for a 16 meter diameter telescope located near the lunar equator. In addition to detailed analyses for a telescope located in a flat area near the equator, the thermal effect of locating the telescope in a crater, on a hill, and at higher latitude sites is discussed. Because an unprotected telescope experiences {{a wide range of}} temperature swings, several thermal protection schemes have been examined, including domes, sunshades, and ground shields to limit the <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions</b> of the primary mirror. Results of these analyses indicate that mirror <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions</b> can be limited to less than 100 Kelvin (K) per lunar cycle with an appropriate passive thermal protection system (dome), and that the telescope primary mirror can be maintained at less than 100 K for at least 7 days of each lunar cycle.

30|$|The {{pharmaceutic}} batches {{are tested}} post-manufacture process to ensure product quality. The qualified materials are then stored appropriately. Product distribution is also controlled and pharmaceutical companies do evaluate for <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions.</b> Although supply chains are often designed and qualified to minimize <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions</b> for biologics, it is impractical to keep cold chain products consistently at the recommended label storage conditions {{throughout the course}} of production, distribution, and consumer use. Most companies include temperature and humidity monitoring devices to ensure that drug products are maintained within the acceptable range during shipping and distribution. In some cases for extremely sensitive products, excursion limits are defined on the Certificate of Analysis or the product label. Hence there should be allowances for sudden unplanned <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions,</b> provided these excursions fall within the Stability Thermal Budget (STB). STB is defined as “the amount of time (e.g. time out of refrigeration (TOR), time at a given temperature) a drug product in the primary container can spend, outside of registered label conditions without risk to patients and product shelf life”. In fact, temperature outside of registered label conditions is as crucial as time for the drug stability. Current GMP related expectations of regulatory authorities, and industry alike, especially for biologics, puts additional pressure on the the STB, which may affect the end use of the product. As a consequence, new statistical simulation strategies and tools are required to better evaluate the allowances for a product undergoing unplanned <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions.</b> These statistical tools can also be employed for determining “what if (unplanned/contingency)” scenarios, to facilitate informed specification negotiations. The statistical/simulation tools that take into consideration different times and temperatures ranges for batch release, assembly, operations, packaging, distribution, shelf life period, and patient-use/in-use period expect to provide flexibility and risk-based business decisions. Such strategies help assure quality product to the patient without undue burden on the commercial supplier.|$|R

Observable increases began in 1992, maximum temperatures occurred {{during the first half}} of 1993, and the excursion was over by about 1996. Since this excursion followed the Mount Pinatubo eruption by a time scale consistent with published model simulations of the effect of stratospheric aerosol on the mesopause region, we attribute the <b>temperature</b> <b>excursion</b> to that eruption. In addition the data is consistent with a background cooling of roughly 1 K per year, most of which may be attributable to variability in the solar flux. Continued observation towards the coming solar maximum promises to quantify (assess) the “long-term” change in mesopause temperatures resulting from solar variability (anthropogenic effect).|$|E

40|$|Several high field Nb{sub 3 }Sn magnets of {{different}} design are under development for future particle accelerators. The {{high levels of}} stored energy in these magnets and the high current densities in the conductor can cause high peak temperatures during a quench. The thermal gradients generated in the epoxy-impregnated magnet coils during the fast temperature rise can result in high thermo-mechanical stresses. Considering the sensitivity of Nb{sub 3 }Sn to strain and epoxy cracks, {{it is important to}} define a maximum acceptable temperature in the coils during a quench which does not cause degradation of the magnet performance. A program was launched at Fermilab to study the effects of thermo-mechanical stress in Nb{sub 3 }Sn coils, supported by experiments and by analysis. In collaboration with LBNL, a sub-scaled magnet was built and instrumented to measure the effect of the thermo-mechanical shock during magnet quenches.

During the test, the magnet reached the maximum field of {approx} 11 T at the short sample current of 9100 A. <b>Temperature</b> <b>excursions</b> up to 400 K did not diminish the magnet quench performance; only after <b>temperature</b> <b>excursions</b> over 430 K, the magnet showed detraining effects, which reduced occasionally the quench current of about 6 %.
