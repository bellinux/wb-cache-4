5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> is between 1 and 30%.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, 5,791Marines from Mexico's Naval Infantry Force were deployed to assist with recovery and rescue efforts.

Red Cross volunteers began needs assessments on October24 and distribution of humanitarian aid started the following day. Power was restored to 88percent of <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> within two days of the storm. Through the nation's livestock catastrophe fund, 150million pesos (US$9million) were allocated for agricultural areas affected by the storm on October29.

5|$|More than 5000 {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} {{occur in the}} United States each year. <b>Those</b> <b>affected</b> are often adults and male. Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930. An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to a medication mixed in a similar compound, diethylene glycol, resulted in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold.

According to survivors, <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in.

A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|After Chennai {{district}}, Cuddalore {{district was}} among those most severely affected by the flooding. Six of the district's 13 blocks suffered extensive damage during the floods in November. The resumption of heavy rainfall from 1 December again inundated the Cuddalore municipality and the district, displacing {{tens of thousands of}} people. Rains continued through 9 December. Despite the state government and individuals sending rescue teams and tonnes of relief materials to the district, thousands of <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> continued to lack basic supplies due to inadequate distribution efforts; this resulted in several relief lorries being stopped and looted by survivors. Large swaths of Cuddalore city and the district remained inundated as of 10 December, with thousands of residents marooned by floodwaters and over 60,000 hectares of farmland inundated; over 30,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to <b>those</b> <b>affected,</b> that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E

The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Following the flooding, {{the local}} governments in Valladolid and San Enrique {{declared}} a state of calamity to allow funds to reach flood victims. By September26, about PHP700,000 ($14,000USD) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP480,000 ($10,000USD) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September20, the Chinese Government allocated ¥81million ($11.8million USD) in living subsidies for <b>those</b> <b>affected</b> by the typhoon. The International Red Cross, which was already assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments.
