Methods: Sixty patients with rheumatic heart disease undergoing heart valve surgery were randomly divided into the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> (n= 30) and conventional group (n= 30). Then myocardial injury indicators, mitochondrial oxidative stress indicators, inflammation indicators and nerverelated peptides of both groups were analyzed.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionFast track {{programmes}} {{have been}} introduced in pancreatic surgery, but the data are sparse. The aim of this prospective study was to analyse the feasibility of implementing fast track rehabilitation protocol in PD with pancreaticogastrostomy, using historical control for comparison. Materials and methodsBetween April 2012 and December 2012, twenty patients who underwent PD (with pancreaticogastrostomy) were managed by a fast-track rehabilitation protocol. These patients were compared with {{an equal number of}} historical controls treated according to the traditional protocol. ResultsPatients in the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> were able to tolerate liquid (p =  0. 0005) and solid diet (p =  0. 0001) earlier, and they passed stools earlier (p =  0. 02). Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) was significantly reduced in the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> (p =  0. 02). There was no difference in the rates of pancreatic fistula (PF), post pancreatectomy haemorrhage (PPH) and mortality between the two groups. Length of hospital stay was reduced in the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> (median 14 vs 18. 5, p =  0. 007). ConclusionFast track programme appears to be feasible in PD, even with pancreatico-gastric anastomosis. It is associated with early recovery, reduced DGE and reduced hospital stay...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} check whether {{dimensionality}} of the two-factor model {{depends on the}} students’ academic background, we tested several multiple-group models with two grouping variables, as the ‘type of general secondary school’ (0  = nonacademic track, 1  = academic track) and ‘VET-year’ as a dummy coded variable (0  = early period of studies, 1  = later period of studies). For each of the grouping variables, we did a model comparison between two multiple-group models. In the first model, the factor correlation was allowed to vary across groups, whereas in the second it was equal across groups. Loadings, intercepts, and residual variances of the indicators were set invariant across groups. Referring to ‘type of general secondary school’ as a grouping variable, the factor correlation for the nonacademic <b>track</b> <b>group</b> (r = . 52; SE = . 31) does not differ significantly (TRd =  3.16, p = . 075, ∆df =  1, N =  238) from the factor correlation for the academic <b>track</b> <b>group</b> (r = . 84; SE = . 06). Referring to ‘VET-year’ as a grouping variable, the factor correlations also does not differ significantly (TRd =  2.52, p = . 112, ∆df =  1, N =  271) between the early (r = . 62; SE = . 14) and the later period of studies (r = . 76; SE = . 06).|$|E
40|$|In {{the attempt}} to reduce {{postoperative}} complications and costs and improve outcomes the concept of fast track surgery has been proposed. Improvements in anaesthesia techniques and {{a better understanding of}} the pathophysiologic events occurring during and after surgery have made it possible. A group of patients undergoing colorectal resections with a fast track approach were investigated; specifically, the effects on postoperative morbidity, resumption of intestinal function, and duration of hospitalization. Fifty patients were managed according to a protocol which included epidural analgesia, early ambulation, and oral feeding (fast track group); they were compared to 50 patients managed with a different protocol: no epidural analgesia and early ambulation, early oral diet (control group). Primary outcome end-points reported include morbidity, time to passage of flatus and stool, and length of hospital stay. Fourteen complications occurred in the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> and 13 in the control group (P = NS). Resumption of intestinal function occurred after 3 days, and length of hospital stay was 5 days in the fast <b>track</b> <b>group</b> compared to 4 and 7 days respectively in control patients (P = NS, P < 0. 01).

40|$|Social {{influence}} among users (e. g., collaboration on a project) creates bursty {{behavior in}} the underlying high performance computing (HPC) workloads. Using representative HPC and cluster workload logs, this paper identifies, analyzes, and quantifies the level of social influence across HPC users. We show {{the existence of a}} social graph that is characterized by a pattern of dominant users and followers. This pattern also follows a power-law distribution, which is consistent with those observed in mainstream social networks. Given its potential impact on HPC workloads prediction and scheduling, we propose a fast-converging, computationally-efficient online learning algorithm for identifying social groups. Extensive evaluation shows that our online algorithm can (1) quickly identify the social relationships by using a small portion of incoming jobs and (2) can efficiently <b>track</b> <b>group</b> evolution over time. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Detecting and {{tracking}} people {{and groups of}} people is a key skill for intelligent vehicles, interac-tive systems and robots that are deployed in humans environments. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} detecting groups of people from learned social relations between individuals with the goal to reliably <b>track</b> <b>group</b> formation processes. Opposed to related work, we track and reason about multiple social grouping hypotheses in a recursive way, assume a mobile sensor that perceives the scene from a first-person perspec-tive, and achieve good tracking performance in real-time using RGB-D data. In experiments in large-scale outdoor data sets, we demonstrate how the approach is able to track groups of people with varying sizes over long distances with few track identifier switches.
