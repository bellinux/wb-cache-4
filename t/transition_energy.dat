25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic <b>transition</b> <b>energy,</b> some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
2500|$|The closest Franck–Condon {{analogy is}} due to the {{interaction}} of phonons (quanta of lattice vibrations) with the electronic transitions of chromophores embedded as impurities in the lattice. In this situation, transitions to higher electronic levels can take place when the energy of the photon corresponds to the purely electronic <b>transition</b> <b>energy</b> or to the purely electronic <b>transition</b> <b>energy</b> plus the energy of one or more lattice phonons. In the low-temperature approximation, emission is from the zero-phonon level of the excited state [...] to the zero-phonon level of the ground state or to higher phonon levels of the ground state. Just like in the Franck–Condon principle, the probability of transitions involving phonons is determined by the overlap of the phonon wavefunctions at the initial and final energy levels. For the Franck–Condon principle applied to phonon transitions, the label of the horizontal axis of Figure 1 is replaced in Figure 6 with the configurational coordinate for a normal mode. The lattice mode [...] potential energy in Figure 6 is represented as that of a harmonic oscillator, and the spacing between phonon levels (...) is determined by lattice parameters. Because the energy of single phonons is generally quite small, zero- or few-phonon transitions can only be observed at temperatures below about 40 kelvins.|$|E

In 1989-1993 first measurements were performed using high-quality germanium detectors, resulting in an estimate of E = 3.5±1.0 eV for the 229Th isomer <b>transition</b> <b>energy.</b> This unnaturally low value triggered a multitude of investigations, both theoretical and experimental, trying to determine the <b>transition</b> <b>energy</b> precisely and to specify other properties of the isomer state of 229Th (such as the lifetime and the magnetic moment). However, searches for direct photon emission from the low-lying excited state have failed to report an unambiguous signal.
