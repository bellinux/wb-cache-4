40|$|Abstract An order {{admission}} {{model is}} developed to introduce revenue management into MTO B 2 B in-dustries. This solution {{is designed to}} resolve a common order management dilemma faced by manufacturers with severe seasonal demands. Considering the requirement that manufacturing industries be risk averse, {{the objective is to}} maximize the expected <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> under a <b>targeted</b> capacity utilization constraint. The deterministic admission problem and its auxiliary model are presented and solved through an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. Through this algorithm, a reward-threshold order admission policy can be established {{at the beginning of the}} planning horizon, helping companies to achieve a balance between profitability and stability...|$|R
40|$|For {{public transit}} {{operators}} in the U. S., neither fare increases nor fare reduc- tions {{have been successful}} in boosting revenues. A different kind of strat- egy is needed, one that can produce more revenue for transit operators than it costs. This article argues that deep discount group pass (DDGP) programs can accomplish this goal. DDGP programs provide groups of people with unlimited-ride transit passes in exchange for a contractual pay- ment by a group’s employer or other organizing body. While previous research on DDGP programs has ignored their impact on operator revenues, this article addresses that gap by focusing on their revenue-increasing potential. The study estimated and compared before and after revenues earned by three transit operators to draw conclusions about the revenue-increasing potential of group pass programs. The universal DDGP programs analyzed consistently yielded either higher revenues per boarding than the system-wide average or higher <b>total</b> <b>revenues</b> from <b>target</b> markets with the program than without it, proving their potential as innovative instruments for increasing transit operating revenues. Employment-based DDGP programs yielded the highest net revenues to operators. When appropriately priced and carefully deployed, DDGP pro- grams can increase transit revenues, make transit operators less reliant on external subsidy, and become powerful instruments of efficient fare policy in public transit...|$|R

5000|$|The {{fact that}} a {{monopoly}} has a downward-sloping demand curve means {{that the relationship between}} <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> equals price times quantity. A competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is proportional to output. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price. A competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price. For a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for a monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is again zero. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> has its maximum value when the slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is zero. The slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is marginal revenue. So the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when MR = 0. For example, assume that the monopoly’s demand function is P = 50 − 2Q. The <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function would be TR = 50Q − 2Q2 and marginal revenue would be 50 − 4Q. Setting marginal revenue equal to zero we have ...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry's {{core business}} is the innovation, development {{and marketing of}} new drugs. Pharmacogenetic (PG) testing and technology {{has the potential to}} increase a drug's value in many ways. A critical issue for the industry is whether products in development should be teamed with genetic tests that could segment the total population into responders and non-responders. In this paper we use a cost-effectiveness framework to model the strategic decision-making considerations by pharmaceutical manufacturers as they relate to drug development and the new technology of PG (the science of using genetic markers to predict drug response). In a simple, static, one-period model we consider three drug development strategies: a drug is exclusively developed and marketed to patients with a particular genetic marker; no distinguishing among patients based on the expression of a genetic marker is made (traditional approach); and a strategy whereby a drug is marketed to patients both with and without the genetic marker but there is price discrimination between the two subpopulations. We developed three main principles: revenues under a strategy targeting only the responder subpopulation will never generate more revenue than that which could have been obtained under a traditional approach; <b>total</b> <b>revenues</b> under a <b>targeted</b> PG strategy will be less than that under a traditional approach but higher than a naive view would believe them to be; and a traditional approach will earn the same <b>total</b> <b>revenues</b> as a price discrimination strategy, assuming no intermarket arbitrage. While these principles relate to the singular (and quite narrow) consideration of drug revenues, they may nevertheless partially explain why PG is not being used as widely as was predicted several years ago when the technology first became available, especially in terms of pharmaceutical manufacturer-developed tests.
