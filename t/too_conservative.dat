5|$|On March 31, 1995, Specter {{announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States, {{to challenge the}} incumbent Bill Clinton. He entered the race as an alternate to the stereotypical religious conservative image. He was critical of Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed, saying all three were far <b>too</b> <b>conservative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was <b>too</b> <b>conservative,</b> and the offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter {{had made no}} secret of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him as <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> a leader, and the Tanzanian police also accused him of working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E
50|$|In the Merthyr Tydfil area, however, Liberal {{candidates}} were more successful but here <b>too</b> the <b>Conservatives</b> performed strongly.|$|R
50|$|The utopian, neo-feudal {{dreams of}} Manners, Smythe, and Disraeli reflect the same crisis of Victorian {{conscience}} {{that inspired the}} similarly utopian Owenite socialism of the political left. Like Owenism, Young England soon failed, but <b>too</b> ambitiously <b>conservative</b> in a new democratic era, it quietly failed without experiment.|$|R
500|$|Faced with {{essentially}} united {{opposition from}} his own Party's Senate caucus, Eisenhower needed the help of Democrats to defeat the Amendment. [...] Caro summarized the problem: [...] "Defeating the amendment and thereby preserving {{the power of the}} presidency—his first objective—could not be accomplished even if he united his party's liberal and moderate senators against it; there simply were not enough of them. [...] He would have to turn conservative Senators against it <b>too,</b> <b>conservatives</b> who were at the moment wholeheartedly for it—and not just Democratic conservatives but at least a few members of the Republican Old Guard." [...] President Eisenhower continued his opposition. In January, he claimed that the Bricker Amendment would fatally weaken the bargaining position of the United States because the states would be involved in foreign policy, recalling the divisions under the Articles of Confederation.|$|R
5|$|The Montreal Expos hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract. During the 1984 season, Virdon expressed his to Expos general manager John McHale {{that he did not}} want to return to the Expos in 1985. With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, felt that they had lost many one-run games because Virdon was <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> in his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner sought {{increased}} {{integration with}} other Latin American countries. He revived {{and tried to}} strengthen the Mercosur trade bloc and improved relations with Brazil, but without automatically aligning with that country, the regional power of South America. The president tried to keep a middle ground between Brazil and Venezuela, since he considered the Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <b>too</b> <b>conservative,</b> and the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez too anti-American. Kirchner worked with centre-left presidents Lula and Chilean Ricardo Lagos and the left-wing rulers Chávez, Fidel Castro from Cuba and Evo Morales from Bolivia. He established a political alliance with Chávez's government, and by 2008, Argentinian exports to Venezuela were quadruple what they were in 2002. A bilateral military commission was established with Venezuela, through which some technological exchange took place.|$|E
5000|$|Both Ludolf and Otto Camphausen were {{moderate}} Liberals [...] - too honestly Liberalto {{suit the}} views of the king and of the reactionary feudalist cliquearound him, and <b>too</b> honestly <b>Conservative</b> for the impatience of the menof progress. Less than three short months sufficed to convince LudolfCamphausen of this fact, and already on 20 June he tenderedhis resignation to the king.|$|R
50|$|One critic {{argued that}} Freeman <b>too</b> easily {{dismissed}} <b>conservative</b> and anti-communist forces active in New York City at the time, wasting {{a chance to}} explain why leftist labor unions were able to overcome them and implement much of their agenda.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{could it}} have been Babbalanja? Hardly. For, philosophic as the {{document}} was, it seemed <b>too</b> dogmatic and <b>conservative</b> for him. King Media? But though imperially absolute in his political sentiments, Media delivered not himself so boldly, when actually beholding the eruption in Franko.|$|R
5|$|Sherman moved {{north to}} Cleveland in 1853 and {{established}} a law office there with two partners. Events soon interrupted Sherman's {{plans for a new}} law firm, as the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 inspired him (and many other anti-slavery Northerners) to take a more involved role in politics. That Act, the brainchild of Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, opened the two named territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's Act instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. Two months after the Act's passage, Sherman became a candidate for Ohio's 13th congressional district. A local convention nominated Sherman over two other candidates to represent what was then called the Opposition Party (later to become the Republican Party). The new party, a fusion of Free Soilers, Whigs, and anti-slavery Democrats, had many discordant elements, and some among the former group thought Sherman <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> on the slavery question. Nevertheless, they supported him against the incumbent Democrat, William D. Lindsley. Democrats were defeated across Ohio that year, and Sherman was elected by 2,823 votes.|$|E
25|$|That {{means for}} the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest {{compound}}, four of the middle compound {{and two of the}} hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season if its initial batch proves to be <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{had tried}} to {{maintain}} a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal. Many were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|E
5000|$|The {{environment}} is better protected under {{private property rights}} ... We as property owners can't violate our neighbors' property. We can't pollute their air or their water. We can't dump our garbage on their property ... <b>Too</b> often, <b>conservatives</b> and liberals fall short on defending environmental concerns, and they resort to saying, [...] "Well, let's {{turn it over to}} the EPA. The EPA will take care of us ... We can divvy up the permits that allow you to pollute." [...] So I don't particularly like that method.|$|R
50|$|Browne was Director of Policy Exchange, {{the largest}} centre-right {{think tank in}} the UK, where he succeeded the {{founding}} director Nick Boles. He ran Policy Exchange for eighteen months, during which time it doubled in size, but attracted criticism that it came <b>too</b> close to <b>Conservative</b> leader David Cameron.|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} we showed the patient, {{a woman with}} unruptured giant {{aneurysm}} of basilar artery, we showed the done examinations, and therapy dilemmas {{about what to do}} in the given case. We found in literature a number of examples which suggest operation treatment, but of embolisation <b>too,</b> some suggest <b>conservative</b> treatment...|$|R
25|$|Galenson {{received}} an appointment {{as an assistant}} professor of economics at Harvard University in 1946. He left Harvard in 1951 to teach economics at the University of California, Berkeley, where, from 1957 to 1961, he was chair of the Center for Chinese Studies. He left Berkeley in 1965, one of many prominent academics who left after being accused of being <b>too</b> <b>conservative,</b> and took a position as a visiting professor of economics at Cornell University.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} contention between the Prince and Venizelos concerned their {{vision for the}} island's government. Although the chief author of the island's constitution (notably of articles guaranteeing individual liberties and equality between Christians and Muslims), Venizelos believed it was far <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> and granted the Prince too much power. The Cretan assembly had few powers and only met once every two years. Moreover, ministers were in fact counselors to the prince, who alone could approve laws.|$|E
25|$|Scheurer, {{who had run}} as a Democrat in 2004, {{entered the}} race as an {{independent}} after he felt that both Melissa Bean and David McSweeney were <b>too</b> <b>conservative.</b> He criticized Bean more harshly in his campaign than he did McSweeney, asserting that Bean's frequent pro-business votes in Congress are an abandonment of Democratic Party ideals. The focus of Scheurer's campaign was fiscal issues: balancing the federal budget, fixing the United States health care system, and reducing the national debt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deal was}} {{designed}} {{to make up for}} this increase in spending by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers. According to The Hill, Mulvaney spearheaded opposition to the bill. He did not blame Ryan for the budget deal, instead saying that the problem was that <b>too</b> few <b>conservatives</b> had been elected to Congress to pass a budget with a greater focus on debt reduction. Mulvaney said that he expected the budget deal to pass because [...] "it {{was designed to}} get the support of defense hawks and appropriators and Democrats", not conservatives.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{proposed}} {{fault diagnosis}} scheme {{relies on a}} residual generation based on an adaptive observer covering linear time varying (LTV), linear parameter varying (LPV), and state-affine non-linear systems, all with bounded uncertainties. A residual evaluation is then performed by set-membership computations based on zonotopes (polytopes defined as {{the image of a}} hypercube by a linear application). The main advantage of the approach is its rigorous computation of the propagation of pre-specified modelling uncertainty bounds. Within the assumed uncertainty bounds, fault detection is guaranteed to be free of false alarm, while not being <b>too</b> much <b>conservative,</b> as illustrated on the model of a satellite...|$|R
50|$|Like many {{systems of}} {{entertainment}} classification, the IFCO has received criticism for several decisions {{they have made}} in the past. The board {{has been described as}} <b>too</b> zealous and <b>conservative.</b> Many titles that receive 15 certificates from the BBFC are rated 18 by the IFCO. DVD examples include Kick-Ass and Black Swan. Cinema examples (which bypass the 16 rating) include Charlie Countryman and Kidulthood.|$|R
25|$|Many Democrats came {{to believe}} that Davis's {{political}} career was over after his defeat in his run for the Senate, but Davis created a new campaign team. He won a landslide victory in his race for Lieutenant Governor in 1994, receiving more votes than any other Democratic candidate in America. Davis ran as a moderate candidate against Republican Cathie Wright. Davis used ads to depict Wright as a Republican who was <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> for California. Davis had a large advantage in campaign funds.|$|E
25|$|Stout re-entered {{parliament}} after {{a winning}} a by-election in Inangahua on 8 June 1893. Ballance's deputy, Richard Seddon, had {{by this time}} assumed leadership of the party on the understanding that a full caucus vote would later be held. In the end, however, no vote was held. Stout, backed by those who considered Seddon <b>too</b> <b>conservative,</b> attempted to challenge this, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Many of Seddon's supporters believed that the progressive views of Ballance and Stout were too extreme for the New Zealand public.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{responded by}} sending Cripps to India {{on a mission}} ("the Cripps Mission") to {{negotiate}} {{an agreement with the}} nationalist leaders Gandhi, claiming to speak on behalf of all Indians and Jinnah claiming to speak on behalf of the Muslims, that would keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for self-government after the war, notionally promised by the Government of India Act, 1935. Cripps designed the specific proposals himself, but they were too radical for Churchill and the Viceroy, and <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> for the Indians, and no middle way was found.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: While {{the team}} {{did have a}} great {{presentation}} and applauded Clay Aiken's singing and Lisa Lampanelli's writing, the jingle itself didn't highlight the brand messaging. The executives felt the 1960s theme was <b>too</b> safe & <b>conservative,</b> even though their jingle was energetic. And lastly, the executives was disappointed in Dayana's appearance and felt {{that she should have}} played an active role.|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} firm {{standard}} for Java and the somewhat more volatile nature of its specifications have been {{a constant source of}} criticism by stake-holders wanting more stability and conservatism in the addition of new language and library features. In contrast, the C++ committee also receives constant criticism, for the opposite reason, i.e., being <b>too</b> strict and <b>conservative,</b> and taking <b>too</b> long to release new versions.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{marks the}} return of the centre console being clearly angled towards the driver, another marked change from its immediate predecessor which was noted for its non traditional BMW design. However, opinion is divided, as a reviewer described the F10 as <b>too</b> bland and <b>conservative,</b> compared to the E60 predecessor, as well as having too much of a resemblance to the E90 3-Series.|$|R
25|$|Due {{to several}} factors, {{membership}} declined {{dramatically in the}} 1920s. There were conflicts with other labor groups, particularly the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which regarded the IWW as too radical, while the IWW regarded the AFL as <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> and dividing workers by craft. Membership also declined due to government crackdowns on radical, anarchist and socialist groups during the First Red Scare after World War I. The most decisive factor in the decline in IWW membership and influence, however, was a 1924 schism in the organization, from which the IWW never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|Swimming was {{not only}} a sport for the {{residents}} of Victorian East London, Eastern Cape, but due to periodic water shortages, sometimes a necessity. From 1873 the town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. These regulations were <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> and constraining for the taste of the residents of this coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. The dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should wear suitable swimming costumes.|$|E
25|$|Gompers's {{trade union}} {{philosophy}} and {{his devotion to}} collective bargaining with business proved to be <b>too</b> <b>conservative</b> for more radical leaders such as Ed Boyce, president of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), and, later, WFM secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood. In 1905, Haywood and the WFM helped to establish the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, whose members were known as Wobblies), {{with the goal of}} organizing the entire working class. The IWW's long-term goal was to supplant capitalism with a workers' commonwealth. Nonetheless, when government abuses against the leaders of the WFM seemed too egregious, Gompers relented and offered assistance.|$|E
50|$|His {{majority}} was substantially {{increased at}} the 1983 general election, after boundary changes removing the mining {{area to the}} neighbouring Sherwood constituency (although that <b>too</b> went <b>Conservative</b> in 1983). He also supported the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in the 1984 UK miners' strike, but criticised the 31 pit closures announced by Michael Heseltine in October 1992. He {{was one of many}} Conservative MPs to lose their seats in the Labour landslide at the 1997 general election. The victor, Fiona Jones, was convicted of falsifying her election expenses in March 1999, and Alexander was to stand at the resulting by-election, but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 1999 with no need for a by-election.|$|R
50|$|The Lumia Icon {{received}} fairly positive reviews, {{with some}} reviewers {{calling it the}} best Windows Phone released, praising the phone's camera quality, display, and overall speed but detracting its being locked to one carrier and having a camera with a slow transition time between taking photographs. Reviewers were split {{on the design of}} the phone, with some praising its metal build quality as solid and premium, and others criticizing it for being <b>too</b> utilitarian and <b>conservative.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 2008 BBC Segment local {{politician}} Trudy Dean {{suggested that}} the channel was biased towards the Conservatives, and rarely interviewed other political parties, the channel's editor John McGhie responded by stating that {{in the same way}} that Labour cabinet members in the national government were on the BBC more because they were in office, so <b>too</b> were the <b>Conservatives</b> locally in Kent and that on all party political matters, all three parties within KCC (Kent County Council) were given equal say.|$|R
