5|$|The initial budget, at {{approximately}} $140 million, led Evan Almighty <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals {{in a controlled}} location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget {{was estimated to be}} around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.|$|E

5|$|In his ghostly form, Frank {{confronts the}} Grim Reaper and discovers {{that he is}} the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a {{psychiatric}} hospital orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed.

Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to Hell.|$|E

5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E

5|$|Vijay {{began the}} new {{millennium}} with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. While Friends was commercially successful, the other two underperformed. His subsequent films that were released for the next year-and-a-half did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's Ghilli (2004), which went on <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> commercially successful Tamil film of the year. It {{was also the first}} Tamil film to earn 500million (Indian rupees). His performance as a caring brother in the masala film Thirupachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). The latter garnered him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor. Barring Vettaikaaran (2009), all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Thamizh Magan (2007), where he played dual roles {{for the first time in}} his career, to his 50th film, Sura (2010), were commercial failures.|$|E
