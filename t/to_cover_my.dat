500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>my</b> cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

He moved the [...] "colored" [...] section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, [...] "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>my</b> body like a quilt on a winter night." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhuge Dan's son, Zhuge Jing (諸葛靚), {{was sent}} as a hostage to Eastern Wu in 257 {{in return for}} support from Wu forces for his father's rebellion. He {{remained}} in Wu and served as Minister of War (大司馬). In 280, after the Jin dynasty conquered Wu, Zhuge Jing went into hiding {{in the home of}} his sister (the one who married Sima Zhou). The Jin emperor Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) considered Zhuge Jing his relative (Sima Zhou was an uncle of Emperor Wu) and knew that Zhuge Jing was hiding in his sister's home, so he paid them a visit. When Zhuge Jing heard that the emperor had come to visit him, he hid in the latrine and refused to come out. The emperor insisted on seeing him and said, [...] "Today, we finally meet each other again." [...] Zhuge Jing replied tearfully, [...] "I regret not being able <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>my</b> body in paint and remove the skin from my face before I meet Your Majesty again!" [...] Emperor Wu appointed him as a Palace Attendant (侍中), but he refused to accept, returned to his hometown and lived {{the rest of his life}} as a commoner. Zhuge Jing had two sons: Zhuge Yi (諸葛頤) and Zhuge Hui (諸葛恢). Zhuge Yi served as Minister of Ceremonies (太常) during the Jin dynasty and was favoured by Emperor Yuan. Zhuge Hui served as Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E

60|$|Note, During {{all this}} time, I worked {{to make this}} room or cave spacious enough to {{accommodate}} me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar: as for my lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> all <b>my</b> place within my pale with long poles {{in the form of}} rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch.|$|R
5000|$|While {{her work}} in porn helped fuel her {{political}} beliefs, Weeks says she began developing her ideology earlier in life. [...] "I grew up Catholic, so I {{grew up in a}} very, very, conservative background and that, I think, really was kind of the impetus for why I wanted to become a libertarian.

60|$|I hired {{two men and}} {{set them}} to work to dig a gravel-pit.

60|$|Match after match I struck, {{and when}} the box was empty I {{must have been a}} mile, two miles, maybe more, from the starting-point.

6000|$|But I saw it {{was only}} again <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> a doubt. <b>My</b> condition, for her, was questionable, and I felt it would be still more so on her hearing what it was.

6000|$|Prothero's {{face lit}} with satisfaction. Then his countenance fell again.

60|$|This made me {{resolve to}} cut some more stakes, {{and make me}} an hedge like this in a {{semicircle}} round my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling, which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at above eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.|$|R

60|$|AFTER {{my return}} from Gilolo to Ternate, in March 1858, I made {{arrangements}} for my long-wished-for voyage {{to the mainland}} of New Guinea, where I anticipated that my collections would surpass those which I had formed at the Aru Islands. The poverty of Ternate in articles used by Europeans was shown, by my searching in vain through all the stores for such common things as flour, metal spoons, wide-mouthed phials, beeswax, a penknife, and a stone or metal pestle and mortar. I took with me four servants: my head man Ali, and a Ternate lad named Jumaat (Friday), to shoot; Lahagi, a steady middle-aged man, to cut timber and assist me in insect-collecting; and Loisa, a Javanese cook. As I knew I should {{have to build a}} house at Dorey, where I was going, I took with me eighty cadjans, or waterproof mats, made of pandanus leaves, <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> over <b>my</b> baggage on first landing, and to help to roof my house afterwards.|$|R
