40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> of {{a population}} in a stochastic environment whose dynamics in <b>the</b> absence of <b>harvesting</b> are described by the logistic Verhulst-Pearl model. Using ergodic optimal control, we find <b>the</b> optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy which maximizes the asymptotic yield of harvested individuals. To our knowledge, ergodic optimal control has not been used before to study harvesting strategies. However, it is a natural framework because <b>the</b> optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy will never be such that <b>the</b> population is <b>harvested</b> to extinction [...] instead <b>the</b> <b>harvested</b> population converges to a unique invariant probability measure. When the yield function is the identity, we show that the optimal strategy has a bang-bang property: there exists a threshold $x^*> 0 $ such that whenever the population is under <b>the</b> threshold <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> rate must be zero, whereas when the population is above <b>the</b> threshold <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> rate must be at the upper limit. We provide {{upper and lower bounds}} on the maximal asymptotic yield, and explore via numerical simulations how <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> threshold and <b>the</b> maximal asymptotic yield change with the growth rate, maximal <b>harvesting</b> rate or <b>the</b> competition rate. In the case when the yield function is strictly concave, we prove that <b>the</b> optimal <b>harvesting</b> strategy is continuous. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: <b>The</b> <b>harvesting</b> of a tooth as a {{candidate}} for tooth autotransplantation requires that the delicate dental tissues around the tooth be minimally traumatized. This is especially so for the periradicular tissues of the tooth root and the follicular tissues surrounding the crown. The aim of this report is to describe the use of piezosurgery as an attempt at morbidity reduction in <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> of teeth for autotransplantation. Methods: A piezosurgical handpiece and its selection of tips were easily adapted to allow <b>the</b> <b>harvesting</b> and delivery of teeth for autotransplantation purposes. Results: Twenty premolar teeth were harvested using a piezosurgical device. <b>The</b> <b>harvested</b> teeth were subsequently successfully autotransplanted. All twenty teeth healed in a satisfactory manner without excessive mobility or ankyloses. Conclusions: Piezosurgery avoids some of the traumatic aspects of harvesting teeth and removing bone which are associated with thermal damage from the use of conventional rotary instruments or saws. Piezosurgery can be adapted to facilitate <b>the</b> predictable <b>harvesting</b> of teeth for autotransplantation purposes...|$|R
