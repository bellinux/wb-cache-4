5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system. He determined <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce and child support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed her suit for alimony and child support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child. The couple reunited in their rocky marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1787 Dennie was {{admitted}} to the sophomore class of Harvard College, where he was very popular with his peers. This popularity did not extend to his tutors, and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty. Dennie had difficulty finding suitable employment after earning his degree in 1790, but by 1793 he was practicing law (though earning very little for his work). In a January 1794 letter to his parents, however, Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown, New Hampshire. Nevertheless, he insisted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law, though by then he was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts. Shortly after writing the letter, Dennie {{was admitted}} to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown. However, he rarely appeared in open court; indeed, he probably made only one appearance.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportional}} representation {{system for the}} House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, {{was the first major}} electoral reform under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals, as had previously been the case, voters cast ballots for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are {{selected on the basis of}} the parties' proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.|$|E
5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E
5|$|In {{discussing}} the more lighthearted {{elements of the}} plot, such as Dr. Morris, a character who tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark elements of the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision to include more dialogue than previous entries in the series was to ensure <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may make it seem like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|The next installment, also titled God of War, {{was officially}} {{announced}} at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer. The trailer showed a fully bearded Kratos, {{who now has}} a son, and Kratos is teaching the boy how to hunt. The end of the trailer showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, {{as well as a}} Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. The game will take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods. Although further games have not been officially announced, Cory Barlog confirmed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> installment would not be Kratos' last game. At E3 2017, another trailer was shown and it was confirmed that the game will release in early 2018.|$|E
