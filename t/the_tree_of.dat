5|$|In North America, A. altissima {{is present}} from Massachusetts in the east, west to {{southern}} Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and {{east to the}} north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree. It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E

5|$|In {{northern}} Europe <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven was {{not considered}} naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven were made shortly {{after it was}} introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven. D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{have their}} roots {{in the ground and}} their trunk and {{branches}} extended towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it. In India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk. Democracy started in North America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their weapons under <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).

The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam.

Photochemically, a close coupling was found to exist between A, ψpd, RH, the time needed to reach the maximum fluorescence level, i. e.
