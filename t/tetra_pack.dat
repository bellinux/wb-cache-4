40|$|Technology {{development}} is a sophisticated process including multiple development phases. Already the research phase as {{the first phase of}} the development process can significantly determine the later technical, economical and environmental performance of a technology. Due to the high environmental impact of technologies during their life cycle, the use of sustainability analysis methodologies in an early stage of technology development seems valuable. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology to analyze the environmental impact of products during their whole life cycle. This methodology was originally developed to compare different yet functionally analogous products, such as <b>tetra</b> <b>packs</b> and glass bottles. In the last 20 years, life cycle based product analysis became increasingly popular and was adapted to new application fields requiring adaptation also of the LCA methodology itself. Thus, multiple new approaches and methodologies were developed. Due to the lack of a uniform scientific LCA approach, a general LCA methodology towards the analysis of different product types and application fields (i. e. technology development) is currently unavailable. The present work examines the application of LCA in technology development. The study includes an analysis of existing methodological approaches, and the identification of technology-specific requirements for the LCA on the example of a case study. In addition, a new method for the application of LCA in the development of a new technology was designed and successfully applied to the case study. As an example for the development of a complex technology, a microreactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) in a Gas-to-Liquid (GtL) process was chosen as a case study. The focus of the theoretical work lies in the modeling of the technology development process and how to deal with different models in LCA and technology development. Based on the general systems theory, a model of microreactor development was created. Subsequently, a method for the application of LCA on the model of micro-reactor development was developed. Using this novel methodology, four phases of the microreactor development were analyzed by LCA; design and manufacturing, use of a microreactor for the FTS, application of the microreactor in the GtL process and application of the GtL process for the substitution of gas flaring in offshore oil production. The LCA results obtained with the new methodology provide evidence on environmental effects of various design configurations of the technology under development throughout the development process. The application of this new methodology during the microreactor development process for the first time allows the creation of environmentally optimized GtL processes for site-specific oil production...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong {{is facing}} a tough waste {{management}} problem due to the increasing waste load and lack of landfill spaces and other waste treatment methods. On the other hand, waste minimization measures are yet {{to be effective in}} reducing waste load. Universities in Hong Kong are also generating a lot of waste which has become a big challenge to sustainable development in their campuses. The higher education sector in Hong Kong has the obligations for diverting their waste from landfill and play role models for the public. Good waste management strategies are required. However, there is little published information on the waste characteristics on universities in Hong Kong {{as well as in the}} world. This study was set out to investigate the waste characteristics of the residential student population of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). This study was conducted in a residential college in HKU with slightly more than 400 student residents. Waste audits were conducted on all 20 floors to gather basic information on the quantity and characteristics of the waste stream of the residential college. At present, there are two garbage bins, one composting box and at least one recycling bin on each floor. Specially, on the 4 thfloor podium, there is a four-bin system and a Bokashi composting system for storing and composting the recycled materials and food waste from each floor, respectively. The waste audit results show that the mean waste generation in the residential college was 0. 11 kg per student per day, which was much lower than the mean daily waste generation of Hong Kong people of 0. 89 kg per person per day (in 2014). However, this may not be the total waste generated by the students per day as they spent most of the day time outside the residential college. Meanwhile, like the municipal solid waste characteristic in Hong Kong, food waste had the largest proportion (37. 1 % by weight) followed by papers (4. 1 %), plastic packaged food containers and packaging materials from supermarkets (3. 9 %) and glass bottles (3. 1 %). Currently, only 9. 6 % of the total waste was recycled in the residential college and 73 % of the wastes dumped are recyclables that are not recycled. These clearly show that waste recycling was done poorly despite the availability of sufficient recycling facilities in the residential college. Recommendations on improving the current waste management in this residential college were put forward according to the waste audit results. Firstly, recycling facilities and service provision should be improved. Behavior change methods including educational seminar, workshop and display together with green purchasing policies should be provided. Campaigns or competition on waste minimization may also be run in the residential college. Moreover, measures for recycling <b>tetra</b> <b>packs,</b> reducing food waste and take-away containers, and green purchasing in supermarkets should be takento further release the landfill pressure and to achieve sustainable development. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

Methods The present study used a qualitative method (satisfaction) and quantitative methods (grip and pinch strength, dexterity, time and attempts) in two conditions (bed; chair) in a sample of well older community dwelling adults (n = 34). Packs tested included foil sealed thickened pudding, foil sealed thickened water, <b>tetra</b> <b>pack,</b> dessert, custard, jam, cereal, honey sachet and cheese portions. Results Honey sachets, cheese portions, foil sealed thickened pudding and tetra packs were the most difficult packs to open, with 15 % of cheese portions unable to be opened in either the bed or chair posture. Although grip strength was consistent for each posture, pinch grips and dexterity were adversely affected by the bed posture. Lying in a hospital bed required greater pinch strength and dexterity to open packs. Conclusions Eating in a seated position when in hospital has been shown to improve intake. The present study demonstrates that eating in a seated posture is also advantageous for opening the food and beverage packs used in the NSW hospital food service and supports the notion that patients should sit to eat in hospital...|$|E

O leite cru (250 litros) foi dividido em duas porções que foram armazenadas em tanques de expansão a 4 ? 1 ºC por seis dias. Uma porção foi adicionada de CO 2 grau alimentício até que o pH do leite atingisse 6, 20, enquanto a outra serviu de controle. O leite cru foi avaliado quanto ao pH, acidez, prova do álcool, composição físico-química, proteólise, lipólise, cor e concentração de CO 2 após a injeção. Para caracterização microbiológica, o leite cru foi avaliado quanto à contagem padrão em placas e de micro-organismos psicrotróficos no dia da recepção e após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado. As amostras foram submetidas ao tratamento UHT por injeção direta de vapor (143 ºC/ 4 s), envasadas em embalagens tetra brik asseptic de 125 ml e armazenadas em BOD a 25, 35 e 45 ºC por 180 dias. No dia seguinte, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto as mesmas características do leite cru, além da prova do álcool, viscosidade, sedimentação, eletroforese, peptídeos por HPLC e esterilidade comercial. Após 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 e 180 dias de armazenamento, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto ao pH, acidez, nitrogênio e frações nitrogenadas, cor, ácidos graxos livres, sedimentação, viscosidade, eletroforese e peptídeos por HPLC. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de sub-sub-parcelas divididas e o experimento foi repetido três vezes. O efeito do tratamento, da temperatura e do tempo de armazenamento, e a interação destes fatores sobre as características do leite UHT foi avaliado por análise de variância (ANOVA) e teste de Tukey ao nível de 5 % de significância. Após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado, não houve diferença significativa nas características físico-químicas do leite adicionado ou não de CO 2, exceto na quantidade de ácido graxos livres que foi maior no leite controle do que no adicionado de CO 2. A adição de CO 2 inibiu o desenvolvimento de micro-organismos durante o armazenamento refrigerado, uma vez que a contagem total e de psicrotróficos do leite controle foi maior que as contagens do leite adicionado de CO 2. O pH das amostras de leite UHT armazenadas a diferentes temperaturas foi afetado pela temperatura e pelo tempo de armazenamento, apresentando maior decréscimo do pH nas amostras armazenadas a 45 ºC. A cor das amostras a 25 °C não apresentou escurecimento durante os 180 dias, enquanto as armazenadas a 35 °C e 45 °C apresentaram desenvolvimento de cor visível a olho nu e aumento no valor b* ao longo do tempo. A lipólise do leite UHT foi maior nas amostras armazenadas a 45 ºC. A proteólise foi maior no leite armazenado a 45 °C, cujo aumento não refletiu na viscosidade e sedimentação do leite, que não foram significativamente afetados até o 120 ° dia de armazenamento, prazo de validade usualmente garantido pelas indústrias de processamento de leite UHT no BrasilAbstract: The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of CO 2 addition to raw milk on the characteristics of UHT milk obtained by direct steam injection and stored at 25 ° C, 35 ° C and 45 ° C for 180 days. Raw milk (250 liters) was divided in two portions that were stored in bulk tanks at 4 ± 1 ° C for six days. To one portion was added food grade CO 2 until the pH of milk was 6. 20, while the other portion was the control sample. Raw milk was evaluated for pH, acidity, physicochemical composition, proteolysis, lipolysis, color and concentration of CO 2 after injection. Raw milk was evaluated for standard plate count and psychrotrophic micro-organisms on the reception and after six days of cold storage, for microbiological characteristics. The samples were submitted to UHT treatment by direct steam injection (143 °C/ 4 s), packed in 125 ml <b>Tetra</b> Brik Asseptic <b>packing</b> and stored in BOD at 25, 35 and 45 ° C for 180 days. One day after processing, the samples were evaluated for the same characteristics of raw milk, plus alcohol stability, viscosity, sedimentation, electrophoresis, peptides by HPLC and commercial sterility. After 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of storage, samples were evaluated for pH, acidity, nitrogen and nitrogen fractions, color, free fatty acids, sedimentation, viscosity, electrophoresis and peptides by HPLC. The experimental design was split-split-plot and the complete experiment was repeated three times. The effect of treatment, temperature and storage period as well as the interaction of these factors on the characteristics of UHT milk was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey¿s test at 5 % significance level. After six days of cold storage, there was no significant difference in the physicochemical characteristics of raw milk with or without CO 2 addition, except for free fatty acid values, which were higher for the milk without CO 2 addition. The addition of CO 2 inhibited the development of microorganisms during storage, since the standard plate count and psychrotrophic count of milk control was higher than values for the CO 2 added milk. The pH of UHT milk samples was affected by temperature and storage time, showing greater decrease in pH for samples stored at 45 °C. The color of the samples at 25 °C showed no browning during the 180 days, while those stored at 35 ° C and 45 ° C showed brown color visible to the naked eye and an increased b * value over time. Lipolysis of UHT milk samples was higher for samples stored at 45 °C. The proteolysis was higher in milk stored at 45 °C, whose increase was not reflected in viscosity and sedimentation of the milk, since these parameters were not significantly affected during 120 days-storage, period of shelf life usually guaranteed by the processing industries of UHT milk in Brazi...|$|R
