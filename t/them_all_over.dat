25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Ethiopian Revolution in 1974, the name of the university was changed to Addis Ababa University (AAU). By 1974, despite efforts by the government to improve the situation, less than 10 {{percent of the total population}} was literate. The national literacy campaign began in early 1975 when the government mobilized more than 60,000 students and teachers, sending <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country for two-year terms of service. Most critics however saw this as the government's way to silence rising opposition while at the same time creating a network of government spys in the rural areas. Generally the campaign to increase literacy remained illusive even though government reports showed improvements.|$|E
25|$|Further on the way, they {{encountered}} a small settlement called Cavett's Station on September 25. After they had surrounded the place, Benge {{negotiated with the}} inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; unfortunately, one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.|$|E

25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it. Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several tried to see whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's turn to see if he could fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} dolphins as {{a recurring}} motif. Michael forms {{an obsession with}} dolphins and paints <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> his house, the street plan of Hillside is shown to form {{the shape of a}} dolphin {{at the end of the}} film. Nathan Baran of Hybrid Magazine was frustrated by the lack of explanation of the motif, saying: [...] "Never are dolphins discussed by anyone else to have any meaning whatsoever. [...] What is the significance of the dolphin as an image? [...] it is a completely arbitrary image awkwardly stuffed with forced meaning". Posin saw Hillside's formation of a dolphin shape as [...] "beauty and order to the chaos", illustrating Michael's belief in deep beauty where everybody else finds chaos.|$|E

Inside the manila envelope was a detailed replica journal {{similar to the one}} Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of Marion Ravenwood. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for any information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on eBay. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, {{which turned out to be}} fake.

2500|$|The {{creation}} of Somb {{by the supreme}} being is found within the hermeneutics of Serer religion and [...] traditions. By thought, Roog first plotted the shapes of all the trees or plant species yet to come. Through the mythical words, Roog fashioned its placenta on the primordial seed − the seed of the Somb tree. Within this seed, Roog placed all the plant species including their reproductive energies − male and female. Through its feminine principle, Roog opened up and [...] "projected the germ of Somb" [...] which became the bearer of all the plant species found on earth and the underworld. The Somb seed penetrated the earth, the placenta of Roog where it took root and grew. Growing from this placenta, it kept all the plant species within its trunk. When it became a big tree, its trunk swelled diminutively and opened up as if by caesarean section or explosion. From this event, it opened up all the plant species found on Earth, and the rotational movement of the Universe scattered <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in 35 days over a 53-day period. As usual Panahi used non-professional actors, with the {{exceptions}} of Fatemeh Naghavi and Fereshteh Sadre Orafaiy. He saw the lead actress, Nargess Mamizadeh, in a park one day and immediately offered her the role. The film opens with one long, handheld shot that lasts over three minutes and took 13 attempts to achieve. Panahi adopted a different camera style to depict {{each of the four}} main protagonists' lives. For the first, an idealistic woman he used a handheld camera. For the second woman, the camera is mounted on a constantly moving dolly. The third woman's story is told at night in darker outside, and the camera is static with pans and tight close ups. For the last, least optimistic woman both the camera and the woman are completely immobile and very little sound is used. Panahi submitted the film to the Venice Film Festival without getting a permit from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. At the festival it won the Golden Lion, the FIPRESCI prize, the UNICEF prize, the Ecumenical Special Mention, the Sergio Trazzati Award and Mamizadeh won the Italian Film Journalist's Award for Best Actress. The Ministry of Culture and Guidance issued a permit for the film a few days before its screening at the festival, although they already knew that it had been submitted illegally. The Ministry later banned the film in Iran. Panahi was worried that the Ministry would [...] "confiscate and mutilate" [...] all copies of the film, so he made multiple copies and hid <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Iran. Irans's Cinema Deputy Mohammad-Hassan Pezeshk said that The Circle was banned because it had [...] "such a completely dark and humiliating perspective." [...] It was later withdrawn by Iranian authorities from the Fajr International Film Festival for being [...] "offensive to Muslim women".|$|E
