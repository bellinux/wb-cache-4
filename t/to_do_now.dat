Twilight is officially crowned in a grand celebration in Canterlot, and she thanks her friends for being there to help her.|$|E

500|$|Downes {{held this}} post until 22 August 1944. Due to the {{run-down}} of the Army, the Second Army, always mainly a paper organisation, increasingly had {{less and less}} <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Now</b> nearly sixty, he then accepted an invitation to write the medical history series of the official history of Australia in the war. As part of this, in March 1945, he decided to accompany Major General George Alan Vasey to New Guinea, where Vasey's 6th Division had encountered an atabrine-resistant strain of malaria in the Aitape-Wewak campaign. On 5 March 1945, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft they were travelling in crashed into the sea about [...] from Machans Beach, {{just north of the}} mouth of the Barron River near Cairns. Downes and Vasey were killed along with all nine other Australian service personnel on board. Their bodies were recovered and buried in Cairns War Cemetery with full military honours. Downes was survived by Doris, Valerie and Rosemary. A memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne on 9 March 1945. He became the third most senior Australian officer to die in the Second World War, after General Sir Brudenell White, who died in the Canberra air disaster in 1940, and Lieutenant General Henry Wynter, who died on 7 February 1945.|$|E

500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation.

Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What are we going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was {{an examination of the}} band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E

[...] Other reviews were slightly more mixed. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode a three out of five, but was appreciative of the additions to the cast, as well as many of the actors story lines. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screencrave noted that the episode was similar in tone to the season eight finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio", but that [...] "the addition of Lacy and Duke pay quick dividends as the opener provides flashes of comedy moxie, while helping wash away painful memories of last season." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this whole drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> is march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me a lot of hope for a last-minute resurgence". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote that the [...] "one interesting storyline" [...] may make him watch the remainder of Pam and Jim's story, but not [...] "the rest of this sadly played-out workplace comedy." ...|$|E

[...] In the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on September 1, he finished second by a neck, having been pushed toward the outside of the track by the winner, To Honor and Serve, in the final furlong.
