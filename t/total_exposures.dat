The basic concept of this kind of model is that time-weighted average exposure is defined as the sum of partial microenvironmental exposures, which are determined by the product of UFP concentration and time spent in each microenvironment. In this work, environmental concentrations were derived from previous experimental studies that were based on microenvironmental measurements in the city of Milan by means of personal or individual monitoring, while time-activity patterns were derived from the EXPOLIS study. A significant difference was observed between the exposures experienced in winter (W: 28, 415 pt/cm 3) and summer (S: 19, 558 pt/cm 3). Furthermore, simulations showed a moderate difference between the <b>total</b> <b>exposures</b> experienced by women (S: 19, 363 pt/cm 3; W: 27, 623 pt/cm 3) and men (S: 18, 806 pt/cm 3; W: 27, 897 pt/cm 3).

40|$|Antidepressants are {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} group of medi-cations. Physicians have many classes of drugs {{from which to}} prescribe. The choice is based on many factors such as efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, and cost. Until the 1990 s, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors were the primary agents used for treat-ment of depression. These 2 classes of antidepressants have largely been replaced by newer drugs, such as selec-tive serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), venlafaxine, trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, moclobemide, and bupropion, primarily because of a better safety profile, es-pecially in overdose situations.

40|$|Basel III {{responded to}} the {{financial}} crisis by redefining and expanding the capital requirements for risk-weighted assets and by proposing {{the introduction of a}} leverage ratio setting a minimum level of capital for banks in relation to <b>total</b> <b>exposures.</b> The capital requirement is being increased primarily through the active use of macroprudential capital buffers. As a result, there have been proposals that the leverage ratio requirement should also take into account the level of capital buffers and thus become a macroprudential policy tool. One argument in support of such proposals is that if the level of capital buffers is not taken into account, the leverage ratio may not create a sufficient constraint on the size of banks' exposures and hence not fulfil its intended purpose. This article examines the relationship between the capital and leverage ratios and discusses the options for, and effects of, introducing a macroprudential leverage ratio. We find that the capital and leverage ratios complement each other and that the introduction of a macroprudential leverage ratio could, under certain circumstances, enhance the effectiveness of macroprudential policy...|$|E

40|$|Investigations of radon {{in natural}} water and its {{relation}} to physical and chemical parameters are outlined in this thesis. In particular, a method for measuring 222 Rn in water at low concentrations (~ 20 mBq. l- 1) is described, followed by discussions concerning the design and its application to study both radon and parameters influencing radon levels in natural waters. A topic considered is the impact of fluoride and other aquatic parameters on radon in water. Moreover, variables such as uranium series radionuclides and stable elements in water, bedrock and sediment radioactivity and geology are investigated in two case studies. This was performed by employing radiometric-, chemical-, statistical- and GIS & geostatistical- analyses. The general water chemistry and presence of some elements such as fluoride was observed to influence radon levels in water. Health aspects of radon in drinking water are discussed based on radiation dose assessments.

The pharmacokinetic properties of primaquine, its metabolite carboxyprimaquine, artesunate, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and pyronaridine were assessed in 15 subjects using a noncompartmental approach followed by a bioequivalence evaluation. All drugs were well tolerated. The single oral dose of primaquine did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic alterations to pyronaridine, artesunate, or dihydroartemisinin exposures.
