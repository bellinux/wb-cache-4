500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Stevenage {{announced}} that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with defensive partner Jon Ashton, from fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers. Despite the strong transfer speculation over the summer, he captained the side in Stevenage's {{first game of the}} 2012–13 season, scoring the third goal in a 3–1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup. Shortly after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. His second goal of the campaign came in another cup competition, scoring from close range to briefly restore parity in a 3–2 defeat away to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy in September 2012. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4–1 loss to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award {{as a result of his}} work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated — [...] "we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to day work and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was once again placed in temporary charge while the club searched for a new manager. Just four days later, he took charge of Stevenage's televised away trip to promotion-chasing Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1–1 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead despite them having to play with ten men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early dismissal. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was [...] "proud of the phenomenal performance", and that [...] "the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity we faced was probably something I haven't seen all season, <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>level</b> anyway". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was again able to concentrate solely on the playing side of his game. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals. During his successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts made 239 appearances in all competitions, an appearance record that places him sixth on the club's all-time appearance list, and scored 27 goals.|$|E

The occupants were mainly Second and Third Class women and children. Among the men aboard was Lawrence Beesley, who subsequently wrote a popular book about the disaster. Dr. Washington Dodge was also aboard, having earlier seen his wife and young son aboard Boat 5. He owed his presence aboard the boat to the apparent guilty feelings of Steward F.

Just before Boat 5 was lowered, Ray bundled Dodge aboard. 12-year-old Second Class passenger Ruth Becker was placed in this boat by Moody after being prevented from entering the heavily overloaded lifeboat number 11 which her mother and two siblings had boarded.

He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
