5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach {{may have been a}} member of the Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a handful}} of people claimed to have {{successfully}} contacted Jandek before he began regularly playing in public in 2004 (see below). He releases albums through his own record label Corwood Industries, keeping a Houston post office box so fans can write to Corwood for a typewritten catalogue and order Jandek’s albums, usually at low prices. Many of his albums feature photos of a caucasian man at various ages; although it seemed likely <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> the principal performer, this presumption was not certain until his live debut in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Wessex, long {{ruled by}} the dynasty of Alfred and Æthelred, {{submitted}} to Cnut late in 1015, as it had to his father two years earlier. At this point Eadric Streona, the Ealdorman of Mercia, deserted Æthelred together with 40 ships and their crews and joined forces with Cnut. Another defector was Thorkell the Tall, a Jomsviking chief who had fought against the Viking invasion of Sweyn Forkbeard, with a pledge of allegiance to the English in 1012—some explanation for this shift of allegiance {{may be found in}} a stanza of the Jómsvíkinga saga that mentions two attacks against Jomsborg's mercenaries while they were in England, with a man known as Henninge, a brother of Thorkell, among their casualties. If the Flateyjarbók is correct <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Cnut's childhood mentor, it explains his acceptance of his allegiance—with Jomvikings ultimately in the service of Jomsborg. The 40 ships Eadric came with, often thought to be of the Danelaw were probably Thorkell's.|$|E

25|$|The {{same day}} that Powell arrived in Baltimore, John Surratt and Louis J. Weichmann {{purchased}} a boat at Port Tobacco in Charles County, Maryland. Surratt, and to a much lesser degree Weichmann, were {{members of a group}} led by John Wilkes Booth which planned to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln and spirit him into Virginia, where he could be turned over to Confederate military authorities. The boat was needed to ferry Lincoln across the Potomac River. The two men then traveled to Baltimore on January 21. In testimony for the prosecution in June 1865, Weichmann said that Surratt had $300 which he needed to give to a man in Baltimore. Although Surratt never revealed the man's name, the prosecution at Powell's 1865 trial attempted to show <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Lewis Powell. Historian Edward Steers Jr. agrees that it is likely that Surratt met Powell at this time, while historians David Griffin Chandler and Elizabeth Trindal present their meeting at Parr's China Hall store as fact.|$|E
500|$|The space {{inside the}} tomb was later {{occupied}} by an early Christian hermit. [...] Fellows {{noted that the}} backs of the reliefs still bore the remains of the hermit's religious paintings and monograms. [...] Fellows speculates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> a disciple of Simeon Stylites (390–459AD), one of the eponymously named Christian ascetics known as stylites, who lived on the top of tall columns.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{witnesses}} observed a man leading a horse {{into the street}} and firing near it and Wyatt in his testimony thought this was Tom McLaury. Claiborne said only one man had a horse in the fight, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Frank, holding his own horse by the reins, then losing it and its cover, {{in the middle of the}} street. [...] Wes Fuller also identified Frank as the man in the street leading the horse.|$|E

500|$|Vladislav {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in London from Hamburg on 1 November on the same flight as Dmitry Kovtun. His image is {{recorded}} by security cameras at Heathrow airport on arrival. He is described as being in his early 30s, tall, strong, with short black hair and Central Asian features. Oleg Gordievsky, an ex-KGB agent, has said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> believed to have used a Lithuanian or Slovak passport, and that he left the country using another EU passport.

2500|$|Some sources claim <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{the same}} S.T. Cooper who later {{went on to}} enclose Bulwell Bogs as his own private ground. (See below.) It is known that Cooper died in 1871, aged 39, and also that the protest over the Bogs took place in 1872, {{but this does not}} show {{conclusively}} whether the protest taking place after his death was not down to his actions whilst still alive. There is no other [...] "S.T. Cooper" [...] recorded as being Lord of the Manor of Bulwell, leading many to believe the man to be the same.|$|E

2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in Indiana also praised Beban's performance:"George Beban, {{who has the}} difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous.

[...] His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, {{that it was hard}} to believe <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> naught but a pantomimist. [...] The upward glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion, the hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits, all these phrases were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "He {{will tell}} thee what thou shalt do": This {{may seem to}} us to be strange advice, and not {{consistent}} with the character of pious and virtuous women, which they both bore, and with that modesty they otherwise seem to be possessed of; to clear this, let it be observed, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was,</b> as Naomi thought, the next kinsman, and so in right of the law in , was the husband of Ruth, and therefore might take such a freedom with him as she did; and it seems by the same law as if the woman was to make the demand of marriage, which may serve to reconcile the carriage of Ruth to her character: besides, what things in one age, and in one nation, are reckoned immodest, are not so accounted in another age, and in another nation; add to this the age and gravity of Boaz, and the well known virtue of Ruth to Naomi, she might think herself quite safe in the advice she gave.|$|E

2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in Fort Wayne, Indiana praised the film for its [...] "rare quality of charm and a warmth of appeal {{that is truly}} unique" [...] and concluded: [...] "Here is a story beautiful and exquisite in theme ...
