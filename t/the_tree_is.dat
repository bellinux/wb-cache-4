5000|$|In the 20th century, {{during the}} {{construction}} boom in Bratislava, {{the area of}} <b>the</b> linden <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> endangered. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed to <b>be</b> a preserved <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> area <b>was</b> protected by fencing which enabled huge boughs to grow. Today the holes in <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> evidence of it. <b>The</b> linden <b>tree</b> however deprecated and today survived just as a remainder. In the 1990s its protection was cancelled. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> designated as <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> - <b>the</b> Hero of the year 2003. <b>The</b> Bratislava <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> being {{referred to as the}} [...] "Palffy´s tree" [...] because it was displayed so in one masterpiece from 18th century. Referring to existing historical documents, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> proven to be at least 236 years old. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> could <b>be</b> even older because no data is kept to prove whether <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> not in <b>the</b> past a <b>tree</b> connected and being part of [...] "Prepost" [...] gardens and maybe even the remainder of the original primeval forests of the Small Carpathian Mountains.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> a major tourist {{attraction}} for {{fans of the}} film, although located on private property at Malabar Farm. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> part of [...] "The Shawshank Trail" [...] which features many of the film's iconic locations and attracts up to 35,000 visitors annually.

5|$|In Folkstone, North Carolina, Jack McAlpin, an {{agitated}} Marine Corps private, drives his {{car into}} a tree after several hallucinatory episodes and is apparently killed. On <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a veve, a drawn voodoo religious symbol.|$|E
5|$|Kalpavriksha is also {{identified}} with many trees such as Parijata (Erythrina variegata), Ficus benghalensis, coconut tree (Cocos nucifera), Madhuca longifolia, Prosopis cineraria, Bassia butyracea, and mulberry tree (Morus nigra tree). <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> also extolled in iconography and literature.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

50|$|As of 2015 <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> 1107 years old. Its {{height is}} 22 m and the {{diameter}} of its trunk is 3.5 m.On 29 September 1994 <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> declared a natural monument.|$|R
5|$|In chapter 34, {{the tree}} Glasir is stated as located {{in front of}} the doors of Valhalla. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} as having foliage of red gold and being the most beautiful tree among both gods and men. A quote from a work by the 9th century skald Bragi Boddason is presented that confirms the description.|$|E
5|$|In {{several other}} locations, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> absent from large areas but still {{present in a}} few {{specific}} habitats. An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} {{ailanthus}} as food, including the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> the host plant for the ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|E
5000|$|On November 20, 1997, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> given {{a one-day}} reprieve to {{consider}} opposition to cutting down <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Construction <b>was</b> halted to consider Amsterdam's offer.

5|$|The Christmas tree is {{decorated}} with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity {{is open to the}} public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E

50|$|Look See <b>Tree</b> <b>is</b> {{a lookout}} <b>tree</b> located at <b>the</b> {{southwest}} corner of Arkansas Highway 83 and Pleasant Springs Road in Coleman, Arkansas. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> used as a fire lookout for roughly ten to fifteen years from c. 1930 to c. 1940. As <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> tallest <b>tree</b> in what <b>was</b> at the time an open area, it provided an inexpensive lookout for Arkansas Forestry Commission rangers. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> fitted with climbing pegs, a platform, and a telephone line which connected to a ranger station. A fire tower eventually assumed <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> function, but <b>the</b> pegs and platform <b>were</b> left in <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> Look See <b>Tree</b> <b>was,</b> as of 2006, the only remaining lookout tree in Arkansas.|$|R
5|$|Under this {{sycamore}} tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, {{known as}} the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834.

The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{grown on}} <b>the</b> grove of Frank Adams in Pine Island, Florida.

5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster.

5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
