5|$|<b>Thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a {{refractory}} material {{with the highest}} melting point among any known oxide (3390°C). Adding 0.8–1% ThO2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations. To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2. Small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> in acids.|$|E
5|$|The common {{production}} {{route of}} thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals; extraction of thorium from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{added to}} glass, <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them {{and turn them}} yellow {{over a period of}} years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. <b>Thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore {{is an ideal}} host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white material is <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a {{material}} for heat-resistant ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory crucibles, as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. <b>Thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (<b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide),</b> a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of thorium vary widely {{depending on the}} degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{substances}} {{have been used}} as radiocontrast agents, including silver, bismuth, caesium, thorium, tin, zirconium, tantalum, tungsten and lanthanide compounds. The use of thoria (<b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide)</b> as an agent was rapidly stopped as thorium causes liver cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} oxidation state of thorium is +4, represented in compounds such as <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (ThO2) and thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4), although some compounds are known with thorium in lower formal oxidation states. Owing to thorium(IV)'s lack of electrons in 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colourless. Th3+ compounds are uncommon {{due to the}} large negative reduction potential of the Th4+/Th3+ couple. In 1997, reports of amber Th3+ (aq) being generated from thorium tetrachloride and ammonia were published: the ion was supposedly stable {{for about an hour}} before it was oxidised by water. However, the reaction was shown the next year to be thermodynamically impossible and the more likely explanation for the signals was azido-chloro complexes of thorium(IV). In fact, the redox potentials of thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more {{similar to those of the}} d-block transition metals than the lanthanides, reflecting their historic placement prior to the 1940s as the heaviest members of groups 4, 5, and 6 in the periodic table respectively.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{occurs as}} the rare mineral thorianite. Due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide, these two common {{actinide}} dioxides can form solid-state solutions {{and the name}} of the mineral changes according to the ThO2 content. Thorite (chiefly thorium silicate, ThSiO4), also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the Th4+ and [...] ions are often replaced with M3+ (where M = Sc, Y, or Ln) and phosphate (...) ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released. The Th4+ ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40ppm.|$|E
500|$|Most binary {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} with nonmetals may be prepared by heating the elements together. In air, thorium burns to form ThO2, {{which has the}} fluorite structure. and some other actinide dioxides | journal = J. Nucl.

It is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases; it dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid {{in the presence of}} fluoride. When heated, it emits intense blue light through incandescence; the light becomes white when ThO2 is mixed with its lighter homologue cerium dioxide (CeO2, ceria): this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles. Several binary thorium chalcogenides and oxychalcogenides are also known with sulfur, selenium, and tellurium.|$|E
500|$|Most thorium {{applications}} use its dioxide (sometimes called [...] "thoria" [...] in the industry), {{rather than}} the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300°C (6000°F), the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points. This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases {{the brightness of the}} flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas mantles. All substances emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the visible spectrum, hence the brightness of thorium mantles. Energy, some of it in the form of visible light, is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself, such as a cathode ray, heat or ultraviolet light. This effect is shared by cerium dioxide, which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently, but <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> gives a higher flame temperature, emitting less infrared light. Thorium in mantles, though still common, has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late 1990s. According to the 2005 review by the United Kingdom's National Radiological Protection Board, [...] "although they were widely available a few years ago, they are not any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|A notable exception, {{discovered}} in the early 19th century, {{is the use of}} a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide),</b> heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. [...] These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does. Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Wallach of Vice {{magazine}} commended {{the accuracy}} of the cooking methods presented in the series. In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine. By the season 1 finale, Walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required. The new method Walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and <b>thorium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (ThO2) as a catalyst, as mentioned in episodes [...] "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" [...] and [...] "Más". P2P and methylamine form an imine intermediate; reduction of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminium amalgam, as shown in several episodes including [...] "Hazard Pay".|$|E
