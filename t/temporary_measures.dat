However, the service still operates at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carries a relatively small percentage of passengers, which has resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. <b>Temporary</b> <b>measures</b> were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the subsidy required.

25|$|As the Games began, {{air quality}} in Beijing {{improved}} significantly against prior expectations. Air quality throughout the Games recorded API scores under 100, the official target. Of the 16 {{days of the}} Games, ten days recorded 'Grade I' and six days recorded 'Grade II' air quality in Chinese standards. Media concerns of air quality has also subsided as the Games progressed. However, a 28 July 2008 Greenpeace report stated that average concentration of atmospheric particulate matter in Beijing was still twice the levels the World Health Organization considers safe. Although observers doubted the performance in endurance events due to air quality, humidity and temperature, the men's 10km and marathon events did set new Olympic records. The Chinese authority pledged to continue their environmental efforts after the Games and pointed to their ¥140billion investment {{in the past ten}} years as evidence of their determination. After witnessing the success of their efforts, some of the <b>temporary</b> <b>measures</b> during the Games are being considered for permanent enforcement.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances, {{sometimes}} called the [...] "caution against entangling alliances", is a contemporary term used to describe an early realist United States foreign policy guiding its interaction with other nations.

It has been cited as a rare example of an explicit policy endorsement of what, in international relations, is known as renversement des alliances ("reversal of alliances"): a state abandoning an ally for an alliance with a recent enemy, sometimes against the former ally.|$|E

500|$|In February 2000, {{the land}} invasions began as armed gangs {{attacked}} and occupied white-owned farms. The government {{referred to the}} attackers as [...] "war veterans" [...] although the majority were unemployed youth {{too young to have}} fought in the Rhodesian War. Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU-PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it. Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum. Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s. He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government. In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (<b>Temporary</b> <b>Measures)</b> Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Thomas' appointment, York Minster, {{the cathedral}} of the archdiocese, was damaged {{in a fire}} that swept through York on [...] 1069, and which also {{destroyed}} the refectory and dormitory for the canons. Soon after his consecration, Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral; these {{appear to have been}} <b>temporary</b> <b>measures</b> however, as some time later, probably in about 1075, he ordered {{the construction of a new}} cathedral on a different site. The new building, much larger than the one it replaced, has not survived. It was excavated between 1966 and 1973, showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time. It was longer, had no aisles in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075. Because of the way the foundations were laid out, it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase, with few modifications. It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible, perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy. William of Malmesbury, a 12th-century writer, states that Thomas finished the cathedral, and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100. Some elements of Thomas' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster.|$|E

2500|$|In July, {{the pound}} came under extreme {{pressure}} and Callaghan {{was forced to}} create harsh <b>temporary</b> <b>measures</b> to demonstrate control of the economy. These include delaying all current government building projects and postponing new pension plans. The alternative was to allow the pound to float or to devalue it. Callaghan and Wilson, however, were again adamant that a devaluation of the pound would create new social and economic problems and continued to take a firm stance against it. [...] The government continued to struggle both with the economy and with the slender majority which, by 1966, {{had been reduced to}} one. On 28 February, Harold Wilson formally announced an election for 31 March 1966. On 1 March, Callaghan gave a 'little budget' to the Commons and announced the historic decision that the UK would adopt decimal currency. It was actually not until 1971, under a Conservative government, that the United Kingdom moved from the system of pounds, shillings and pence to a decimal system of 100 pence to the pound. He also announced a short-term mortgage scheme which allowed low-wage earners to maintain mortgage schemes in the face of economic difficulties. Soon afterwards, Labour won 363 seats compared to 252 seats against the Conservatives, giving the Labour government a large majority of 97.|$|E
2500|$|Noting the {{universal}} {{application of the}} laws of tefillin in [...] , Maimonides taught that God designed the wearing of tefillin as a more enduring form of worship than the practice of sacrifices, which Maimonides taught were a transitional step to wean the Israelites off of the worship of the times and move them toward prayer as the primary means of worship. Maimonides noted that in nature, God created animals that develop gradually. For example, when a mammal is born, it is extremely tender, and cannot eat dry food, so God provided breasts that yield milk to feed the young animal, until it can eat dry food. Similarly, Maimonides taught, God instituted many laws as <b>temporary</b> <b>measures,</b> as it would have been impossible for the Israelites suddenly to discontinue everything to which they had become accustomed. So God sent Moses to make the Israelites (in the words of [...] ) “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” But the general custom of worship in those days was sacrificing animals in temples that contained idols. So God did not command the Israelites to give up those manners of service, but allowed them to continue. God changed the service of idol worship to the service of the Sanctuary (...) , to erect the altar to God's name (...) , to offer sacrifices to God (...) , to bow down to God, and to burn incense before God. God forbad doing any of these things to any other being and selected priests for the service in the temple in [...] By this Divine plan, God blotted out the traces of idolatry, and established the great principle of the Existence and Unity of God. But the sacrificial service, Maimonides taught, was not the primary object of God's commandments about sacrifice; rather, supplications, prayers, and similar kinds of worship are nearer to the primary object. Thus God limited sacrifice to only one temple (see [...] ) and the priesthood to only the members of a particular family. These restrictions, Maimonides taught, served to limit sacrificial worship, and kept it within such bounds that God did not feel it necessary to abolish sacrificial service altogether. But in the Divine plan, prayer and supplication can be offered everywhere and by every person, as can be the wearing of tzitzit (...) and tefillin ( [...] ) and similar kinds of service.|$|E
