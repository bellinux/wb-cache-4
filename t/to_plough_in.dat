2500|$|The {{system of}} infield and outfield agriculture, a {{variation}} of open field farming widely used across Europe, may have been introduced with feudalism and would continue until the eighteenth century. This expanded {{from the use of}} small enclosed fields, which continued from the prehistoric era. The infield was the best land, close to housing. It was farmed continuously and most intensively, receiving most of the manure. Crops were usually bere (a form of barley), oats and sometimes wheat, rye and legumes. The more extensive outfield was used for largely for oats. It was fertilised from the overnight folding of cattle in the summer and was often left fallow to recover its fertility. In fertile regions the infield could be extensive, but in the uplands it might be small, surrounded by large amounts of outfield. In coastal areas fertiliser included seaweed and around the major burghs urban refuse was used. Yields were fairly low, often around three times the quantity of seed sown, although they could reach twice that yield on some infields. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the davoch (i.e. [...] "vat"), called the arachor in Lennox. This unit is also known as the [...] "Scottish ploughgate". In English-speaking Lothian, it was simply a ploughgate. It may have measured about , divided into 4 raths or eight oxgangs, the area that eight oxen were said to be able <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> one year.|$|E
6000|$|All these represent, {{as far as}} the {{engraving}} goes, simply nothing. They are not [...] "finished" [...] in any sense but this,--that the paper has been covered with lines. 4. is the best, because, in the original work of Rubens, the lines of the boughs, and their manner of insertion in the trunk, have been so strongly marked, that no engraving could quite efface them; and, inasmuch as it represents these facts in the boughs, that piece of engraving is more finished than the other examples, while its own networked texture is still false and absurd; for there is no texture of this knitted-stocking-like description on boughs; and if there were, it would not be seen in the shadow, but in the light. Miller's is spirited, and looks lustrous, but has no resemblance to the original bough of Turner's, which is pale, and does not glitter. The Netherlands work is, on the whole, the worst; because, in its ridiculous double lines, it adds affectation and conceit to its incapacity. But in all these cases the engravers have worked in total ignorance both of what is meant by [...] "drawing," [...] and of the form of a tree, covering their paper with certain lines, which they have been taught <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> copper, as a husbandman ploughs in clay.|$|E

60|$|We {{have seen}} or heard of many {{extraordinary}} young men who never ripened, or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary. When we see their air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, of books, of religion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions. But they enter an active profession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the common size of man. The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they put their horses of the sun <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> its furrow. They found no example and no companion, and their heart fainted. What then? The lesson they gave in their first aspirations is yet true; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief. Or why should a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho, or Sevigne, or De Stael, or the cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis, none can,--certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint of each new experience, search in turn all the objects that solicit her eye, that she may learn {{the power and the}} charm of her new-born being, which is the kindling of a new dawn in the recesses of space. The fair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of influences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty, inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness. The silent heart encourages her; O friend, never strike sail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas. Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision.|$|E

40|$|In Northern Europe, Elymus repens (L.) Gould infestations are {{traditionally}} controlled by repeated stubble cultivation {{in the period}} from harvest <b>to</b> <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn. However, in organic farming, post-harvest tillage is undesirable due {{to the need for}} retaining nutrients in the cropping system. The soil is mostly cropped in that period, limiting post-harvest tillage. Two control strategies against E. repens are presented that merge the objectives of achieving a significant reduction of E. repens while having the soil covered with plants during the post-harvest period. Strategy I is an integration of rhizome fragmentation by soil cultivation within two days after harvest in early August with subsequent sowing of a catch crop to suppress shoot growth from the rhizome fragments. Strategy II also includes growing a catch crop but is preceded by a mid-summer fallow period lasting 4 - 6 weeks where repeated soil cultivations are conducted to fragment, weaken and desiccate the rhizomes. Strategy II controlled 91 - 90...|$|R

40|$|Researches {{have been}} carried out within the {{framework}} on the EFFICOND Project, focused at evaluating the effectiveness of the standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAECs) established for Cross Compliance implementation under EC Regulation 1782 / 2003. In particular the standard 3. 1 b deals with soil structure protection through appropriate machinery use, with particular reference <b>to</b> <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> good soil moisture conditions. The study deals with the evaluation of soil structure after tillage in tilth and no-tilth conditions at soil moisture contents other than the optimum water content for tillage. The Mean Weight Diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates was used as an indicator of tillage effectiveness. The study was carried out in the period 2008 - 2009 at six experimental farms belonging to Research Centres and Units of the Italian Agricultural Research Council (CRA) with different pedo-climatic and cropping conditions. Farm management and data collection in the different sites were carried out by the local CRA researchers and technicians. The comparison of MWD values in tilth and no tilth theses showed statistically significant differences in most cases, depending on topsoil texture. On clay, clay loam, silty clay, and silty clay loam topsoils a general and significant increase of MWD values under no tilth conditions were observed. No significant differences were observed in silt loam and sandy loam textures, probably due to the weak soil structure of the topsoils. Moreover, <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> good soil moisture condition determined higher crop production and less weed development than <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> high soil moisture conditions...|$|R
