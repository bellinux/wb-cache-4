25|$|Around 400 {{million years}} ago, a small {{continent}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> and thin collided with proto North America. This created the Kittatinny Mountains, {{as the land}} was compressed from the collision. The quartzite that was lying in a shallow sea over top of the Martinsburg shale, folded and faulted due to pressure and heat. The quartzite lifted, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born.|$|E

The painfully flat course was given contours to move rainwater to underground drainage and features that were omitted in 1961 due to financial constraints were added. Bunkers were reconstructed {{and several of}} the severe doglegs (bends) were straightened somewhat. A new cart facility and putting green were also included.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, a {{vocational}} wing {{was added}} on. This addition was {{perceived by the}} board as a move <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> overdue. It felt that the courses that were offered at that time were mainly geared 10 help prepare students for university entrance. These new programmes that would be available would better prepare a student with marketable skills for the job force. At that point in Canadian history, the market for unskilled labourers was rapidly diminishing due to automation in industry and its rapid growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E
25|$|The 1897 Cornell {{crew that}} raced Harvard and Yale was very {{different}} from the other two school’s rowing teams. First, Courtney’s crew was both lighter and shorter than their competition. The Cornell team came in 100 pounds less than Yale and 72 pounds less than Harvard. The other major difference was that Harvard and Yale used a stroke that was influenced by English rowing while Courtney taught his crew his very American stroke. Harvard, coached by Rudolph C. Lehmann, used a typical English stroke <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> and sweeping with the rowers stretching as far as possible on the catch to drive the water hard. Yale, coached by Bob Cook, used a modification of the English stroke, using a much longer slide. Cornell's stroke featured a long stride with little back motion.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".|$|E
500|$|Since the {{sea mink}} {{has only been}} {{described}} by fragmentary remains, its appearance and behaviors are not well-documented. Its relatives, as well as descriptions by fur traders and Native Americans, give a general idea of this animal's appearance and its ecological roles. Accounts from Native Americans in the New England/Atlantic Canadian regions reported that the sea mink had a fatter body than the American mink. The sea mink produced a distinctive fishy odor, and had fur that {{was said to be}} coarser and redder than that of the American mink. It is thought that naturalist Joseph Banks encountered this animal in 1776 in the Strait of Belle Isle, and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox, having long legs, and a tail <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> and tapered towards the end, similar to a greyhound.|$|E

500|$|When the {{aircraft}} were ready, they flew to Iwo Jima and stopped for the night. There they were loaded {{with as much}} fuel as they could hold. It was known that the intended air base in Hokkaidō {{did not have enough}} avgas to fill all three B-29s for the long-distance flight, meaning that at Hokkaidō they could only top off the fuel tanks {{to make up for the}} amount used to fly from Iwo Jima. On September 15, the three aircraft left Iwo Jima, flying north past Okinawa, where the typhoon had blown itself out. They continued to Hokkaidō where the approach involved some apprehension. The Japanese air base had been judged by Colonel William [...] "Butch" [...] Blanchard as suitable for B-29s, with a runway <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> enough and was near sea level for maximum lift in the densest possible air, but it was not known whether it could hold such heavily laden bombers without the concrete cracking. LeMay sent Douglas C-54 Skymasters filled with 55-gallon (210L) drums of avgas to Sapporo—the crewmen would have to top off their tanks by hand.|$|E

2500|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1747 that James Lind {{formally}} demonstrated that scurvy could be treated by supplementing the diet with citrus fruit, in the first ever clinical trial. In 1753, Lind published A Treatise of the Scurvy, in which he explained the details of his clinical trial, but it occupied only a few paragraphs in a work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> and complex and had little impact. [...] In fact, Lind himself never actively promoted lemon juice as a single ‘cure’. [...] He shared medical opinion at the time that scurvy had multiple causes – notably hard work, bad water, and the consumption of salt meat in a damp atmosphere which inhibited healthful perspiration and normal excretion - and therefore required multiple solutions.

Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before.

He became a voracious reader, and was fond of Penny Dreadfuls and the works of Robert Michael Ballantyne and James Fenimore Cooper. At Dumfries, he and his friends spent time in the garden of Moat Brae house, playing pirates [...] "in a sort of Odyssey <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> afterwards to become the play of Peter Pan".

He envisioned that G4 could {{follow in the footsteps of}} MTV, which in his opinion provided music video producers with a venue for non-traditional television programming. Hirschhorn intended G4 to become a vehicle for unconventional advertising. In 2002, G4 offered advertisers wide latitude to place their products on G4's programs, and even allowed their commercials to appear as if they were a part of the program. G4 offered what was called a [...] "2 minute unit", which was an advertising package played as if it were part of a G4 program <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>long</b> enough to run an entire movie trailer.

The affair was common knowledge by September 1944, and Peirse was neglecting his duties. Mountbatten sent Peirse and Lady Auchinleck back to England on 28 November 1944, where they lived together at a Brighton hotel. Peirse had his marriage dissolved, and Auchinleck obtained a divorce in 1946. Auchinleck was reportedly very badly affected. According to his sister, he was never the same after the break-up.
