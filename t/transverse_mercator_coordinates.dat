30|$|Regarding fire occurrence, {{we tried}} to use {{official}} fire statistics for Spain, {{but they do not}} have precise UTM (Universal <b>Transverse</b> <b>Mercator)</b> <b>coordinates</b> of ignition points. The fires are georeferenced to a 10 km × 10 km UTM grid net ([URL] last accessed February 2012). Since the LFMC data has a 1 km 2 resolution, we considered that the official fire statistics may be affected by spatial interpolation methods, and decided to use MODIS Thermal Anomalies product (MOD 14) as a surrogate of fire occurrence. Previous studies have shown that MOD 14 correlates well to fire occurrence (Hawbaker et al. 2008), especially for large fires (Oliva et al. 2008, Morato 2009). Therefore, fire occurrence was selected from the MOD 14 product. The detection algorithm identifies pixels, at 1 km 2 spatial resolution, in which one or more fires are actively burning {{at the time of the}} satellite overpass (Giglio et al. 2003). The results are hotspots shown as the centroids of the pixels. Our temporal series of analysis started in 2001 because it was the year in which MOD 14 was available. Data were downloaded from the University of Maryland’s fire research group ([URL] last accessed February 2012). Only those hotspots with a confidence level higher than 80 % were selected for this analysis to avoid commission errors related to agricultural burns, high temperature soils, and specular surfaces.

The possibility to distinguish different geologic units, sedimentary and volcanic (acid and basic types) {{by means of the}} statistic analyses from the use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometry integrating potash radiation emissions data with geological and geochemistry data is discussed. This Project was carried out at 1973 by Geological Survey of Brazil/Companhia de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais. The Camaquã Project evaluated the behavior of potash concentrations generating XYZ Geosof 1997 format, one grid, thematic map and digital thematic map files from this total area. Using these data base, the integration of statistics analyses in sedimentary formations which belong to the Depressão Central do Rio Grande do Sul and/or to volcanic rocks from Planalto da Serra Geral at the border of Paraná Basin was tested. Univariate statistics model was used: the media, the standard media error, and the trust limits were estimated. The Tukey’s Test was used in order to compare mean values. The results allowed to create criteria to distinguish geological formations based on their potash content. The back-calibration technique was employed to transform K radiation to percentage. Inside this context it was possible to define characteristic values from radioactive potash emissions and their trust ranges in relation to geologic formations.

40|$|Purpose of Study: The Gunther barbed {{projectile}} point type {{has long}} been considered as a time marker of the late prehistoric period in Northern California. During the 39 years since its introduction {{the utility of the}} type has been diluted by a growing sample size, and with it, evidence for a greater range of temporal and morphological variability. Archaeologists have consistently noted this variability and often attempted to identify spatially and temporally meaningful subtypes, but have had little success. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify spatial and temporal patterns associated with morphological variability among Gunther barbed projectile points from Mendocino County. Procedure: To consistently describe and compare morphological variabiHty, metric attribute measurements were recorded for a total of 445 Gunther barbed points from 123 sites and 23 isolated locations in Mendocino County. These attribute values and the Universal <b>Transverse</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>coordinates</b> of each point were entered into a computer database to provide consistent numerical descriptions, and correlate attribute variation with spatial distribution and available temporal information. Findings: Morphological variation among the sample of Gunther barbed points was fou nd to pattern spatially. Variations in serration, size, stem form, and material were distinguished among four geographic quadrants within the County. Ethnographic and available temporal information suggests that the variation among the Gunther barbed projectile points from the four quadrants most likely reflects cultural and temporal differences. A new subtype, the Gunthersnake was proposed, attributes of an Early variant suggested, and support provided for the spatial affiliation of the previously identified subtype, the Round Valley Tanged. Conclusions: This study has successfully demonstrated that the morphological variation so often noted within the Gunther barbed type has the potential to reflect spatial, temporal, and cultural differences. The use of metric attribute measurements and spatial analysis of a large sample of projectile points from the region has proven methodologically effective for identifying these differences...|$|E

40|$|Peatlands are soil {{environments that}} store carbon and {{large amounts of}} water, due to their {{composition}} (90 % water), low hydraulic conductivity and a sponge-like behavior. It is estimated that peat bogs cover approximately 4. 2 % of the Earth's surface and stock 28. 4 % of the soil carbon of the planet. Approximately 612 000 ha of peatlands have been mapped in Brazil, but the peat bogs in the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (SdEM) were not included.

In the northern part of SdEM, 14, 287. 55 ha of peatlands were mapped, distributed over 1, 180, 109 ha, representing 1. 2 % of the total area. These peatlands have an average volume of 170, 021, 845. 00 m³ and stock 6, 120, 167 t (428. 36 t ha- 1) of organic matter and 142, 138, 262 m³ (9, 948 m³ ha- 1) of water.
