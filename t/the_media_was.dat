However, he said {{that this was not a}} change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results.

That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>was</b> critical of Alston for playing Campanella; {{they said that}} the catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers.

40|$|In {{the age of}} information, {{with the}} {{development}} of new technologies, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> playing more significant roles in political and economic activities in societies.

5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>was</b> talking about a second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases {{also said that the}} potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|Hall saw {{the double}} {{dissolution}} {{as an opportunity}} to capture senate seats in all the states across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM's attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam's dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>was</b> almost completely focused on the two main parties, giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{spent the}} next few months in London, seeking out {{supporters}} for his cause in the West End, the City and, occasionally, the rural estates of the landed gentry. These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist Harry Johnston, Alexander Livingstone Bruce (who sat {{on the board of the}} East Africa Company), and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889. The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity. Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, opinion in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>was</b> starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London.|$|E

The choice of methods we used is semi-structured interviews and a quantitative survey “Danske Medie” has made. The theories there {{are being used to}} explain this is; Stig Hjarvard, he <b>is</b> describing <b>the</b> <b>media</b> mediatization. In addition, we have Michel Foucault who has a theory about power. The power lies in how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> can influence voters to have certain attitudes about politics. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> have <b>the</b> power to control what they think is importance and want to send out to the voters. The politicians have no influence on how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> chooses to cover the election campaign. We have in this project been trying to find out whether or not, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> weakening <b>the</b> Danish democracy and if it in fact <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> that has <b>the</b> power? If <b>the</b> <b>media</b> has <b>the</b> power, how does it affect the relation between <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and <b>the</b> voters during the democratic elections?
