To evaluate sucrose as a tracer for leakage testing for various filling materials involved in endodontic treatment. Materials and methodsThe stability of sucrose and glucose was examined by immersing 11 common filling materials (1. 5  ×  3  mm blocks, cured for 1 week at 37 °C in 100 % relative humidity; n =  10 for each) in a 10 mM solution of either sucrose or glucose. The concentration of the solution was measured after 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of immersion and compared. Then, the two tracers were used to test the sealing ability of zinc oxide–eugenol cement (IRM) and amalgam root-end fillings. Each material (n =  40 for each) was equally divided into two subgroups, these were evaluated with either glucose or sucrose as the <b>tracer</b> <b>substance,</b> and the amount of leakage was determined after 24  h, and 1 week, 2 weeks, 3  weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks.

Autoradiograms were made using Kodak NTB- 3 plates 15 min after the intravenous injection of 22 Na. In the adult rats, areas of increased uptake included a band across dorsal medulla and ventral cerebellum {{at the level of the}} foramen of Luschka, some white matter, the lateral walls of the posterior portion of the third ventricle, and the granular and medullary layers of the cerebellum. The regions of the subfornical organ (intercolumnar tubercle) and area postrema showed increased uptake, but the density in these areas was neither greatest at these specific structures nor restricted to them. Autoradiograms of newborn brain showed the greatest sodium uptake in the germinal cell zone (subependymal matrix cells). The neocortex, newly formed cell layers of Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus, pineal body, and subfornical organ showed increased uptake; but the subcommissural organ did not. The density in the region of the walls of the third ventricle was not consistently increased. Areas destined to be white matter showed the least uptake of all.

We believed that the high specificity of WGA–HRP for neural tissue along with the high visibility of its reaction product could help resolve controversies concerning the sensory innervation of the cruciate ligaments. Substantial amounts of WGA–HRP were transported in tibial nerve axons {{to the level of}} the knee. However, using standard HRP histochemistry we found that the capsular tissue and ligament synovia disintegrated during the incubation reaction. This problem was avoided by air drying the tissue slices on glass slides prior to reaction. Abundant labelling occurred in the posterior capsule with dense filling of axons and terminal endings. Sensory endings displayed features consistent with Ruffini endings and pacinian corpuscles. Sensory endings were located throughout the CCL in its sagittal plane, in the subsynovial layers and between collagen fascicles. In each CCL we observed 5 – 17 ovoid and elongated endings with dense terminal arborisations. These endings were between 100 and 150 μm long, were encapsulated, and gave rise to 1 or 2 axons. Large (up to 1. 5 mm in maximum extent) elongated regions of dense, inhomogeneous labelling were found in the body of several CCLs. These resembled Golgi tendon-like endings, with the exception of their large size. We conclude that anterograde transport of HRP to the knee is a useful technique for labelling mechanoreceptors and axons in knee tissue.

40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in deutscher Sprache hinterlegt.) Microbial {{reduction}} of Fe(III) in sediments {{can play an}} important role as a terminal electron accepting process for oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater. Traditionally, quantification of total, extractable or so called bioavailable Fe(III) is assessed by various wet chemical extractions. The main disadvantage of all these methods derives from aquifer heterogeneities, which cannot be taken into account adequately. Furthermore, chemical extraction techniques determine total mass of the (bioavailable) Fe(III) minerals only and limiting factors like decreasing degradation rate due to diminishing mineral surface or passivation by precipitation of reaction products are neglected. Reactive tracers to determine aquifer Fe(III) content or aquifer oxidation capacity (OXC) are being developed to overcome these disadvantages. Reactive tracer tests offer an integral approach to assess aquifer OXC, because tons of aquifer material rather than grams as in chemical extractions are considered here. Tracer solutions use the same groundwater flow paths as contaminants. In this way, geochemical and hydraulic heterogeneities are not „mapped“ in detail, but considered in its completeness. Different approaches exist to use reactive tracers. Sorptive reactive tracers like phosphate interact with the surface of Fe(III) minerals and retardation of the <b>tracer</b> <b>substance</b> allows to determine reactive surface areas and consequently the reducible part of Fe(III) minerals. Redox reactive tracers like sulphide directly reduce Fe(III) present in the aquifer.

40|$|Ca 4 ' {{in blood}} {{has been shown}} to {{exchange}} slowly with rat salivary glands but the mecha nism for the slow exchange has not been eluci dated (Dreisbach, 1957). Rate of blood flow to salivary glands was apparently not the only factor controlling this exchange although no direct evidence of rate of blood flow in salivary gland was presented. Previously, blood flow to the gland has been estimatedby collectingthe venous outflow from the gland after surgical isolation (Barcroft, 1900; Wills, 1941; Burgen, 1956). Using this method, Wills found that the resting venous outflow from the submaxillary gland in cats was 0. 20 ml/g/min rising to over 4. 0 ml/g/min after piocarpine stimulation. However, this method of blood flow determina tioncouldnot be used in ratswithoutseriously disturbing the normal blood flow. Recently, a method for determining the frac tionaldistributionf cardiacoutputin unoper ated animals has been devised which depends upon the short-term uptake of a <b>tracer</b> <b>substance</b> (Sapirstein, 1958). For example, Kâ€•has been used to study the effect of eating on the frac tional distribution of cardiac output between gut and muscle (Reininger and Sapirstein, 1957). Using this method, {{it should be possible to}} deter mine the blood flow in an organ by comparing tracer uptake by that organ with the uptake by an organ in which the blood flow can be deter mined by other methods. The present experiments were undertaken in order to correlate changes in Ca 4 ' uptake by sub maxillary gland with piocarpine-induced changes in blood flow in the gland when determined in the absence of anesthesia or surgical interference. It was felt that such experiments would help to clarify the role of rate of blood flow on the rate of transfer of Ca 4 ' to the submaxillary gland...|$|E
40|$|In vitro degranulation of rat {{mast cells}} was studied at {{different}} intervals ranging from 10 to 60 sec after adding the histamine liberator, compound 48 / 80 (0. 4 µg/ml, 17 ° C). The ultrastructural changes {{were followed by}} electron microscopy, and parallel assays were made to determine the histamine released. In addition, the extracellular tracers lanthanum and hemoglobin (demonstrated by its peroxidative activity) were applied to mast cells to follow communication of the extracellular space with the cavities formed during degranulation. After a lag period of 10 sec, degranulation started in the most peripherally located granules. The perigranular membrane fused with the plasma membrane, resulting in a pore bridged by a thin diaphragm. This was followed by rupture of the diaphragm and extrusion of the granule matrix (exocytosis). The process advanced towards the cell interior by fusion and opening of the deeper situated granules to the formerly opened granule cavities. At {{the end of the}} process, the cell was filled by a system of complicated cavities containing a number of altered granules. Extracellular tracers have shown that these intracellular cavities were in unbroken communication with the extracellular space {{from the very beginning of}} their formation. Both lanthanum and hemoglobin were found to be adsorbed to the limiting membrane of the cavities and bound to altered mast cell granules. In contrast, no <b>tracer</b> <b>substance</b> was present in nondegranulating mast cells. Degranulation of mast cells by compound 48 / 80 is regarded as a sequential exocytosis, a process similar to that described for some exocrine gland cells. All the "intracellular" cavities, formed by degranulation, were shown to communicate with the extracellular space; consequently, granules lying in these cavities must be considered as biologically extracellular. The present findings support the view that histamine is released from the granule matrix by the extracellular ionic milieu...|$|E
40|$|The CoCoMac {{database}} {{contains the}} results of published axonal tract-tracing studies in the macaque brain. The combined data are used to construct the macaque macro-connectome. We discuss the redevelopment of CoCoMac and compare it to six connectome-related projects: two resources that provide online access to raw tracing data in rodents, a connectome viewer for advanced 3 d graphics, a partial but highly detailed rat connectome, a brain data management system that generates custom connectivity matrices, and a software package that covers the complete pipeline from connectivity data to large scale brain simulations. The 2 nd edition of CoCoMac features many enhancements over the original. For example, a search wizard is provided for full access to all tables. Connectivity matrices are computed on demand in a user selected nomenclature. An online data entry system is available as a preview, and {{is to become a}} generic solution for community-driven manual data entry. We end with the question whether tract-tracing will remain the gold standard to uncover the wiring of brains, thereby mentioning developments in human connectome construction, <b>tracer</b> <b>substances,</b> polarized light imaging and serial block face scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{rotavirus}} and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, administered in different sequences, on alkaline and acid phosphatase, leucinaminopeptidase, P-galactosidase, and succinicdehydrogenase of the intestinal mucosa of cesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived calves was investigated. Decrease in enzyme activity was most prominent in dual infections; it also occurred {{in parts of}} the small intestine in monoinfected animals. Increases in enzyme activity involved totally either one or all tissue compartments (crypt, basal villus area, villus tips). Increased activity was present in enteric mucosae that were either not affected or were only slightly affected by rotavirus or enterotoxigenic E. coli. We interpret the increase in enzyme activity as an adaptation of the enteric mucosa to maintain the absorptive function. An altered absorptive capacity of the enteric mucosa {{is one of the most}} important functional derangements leading to diarrhea. This can be studied in vivo by using <b>tracer</b> <b>substances</b> like D- x y l o ~ e ~ ~ or cellobiose mannit 01. ~ ~ In vitro, however, a large number of dif-ferent enzymes can be studied b i ~ c h e m i c a l l y ~, ~ J ~, ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ or his to~hemical ly. ~~,~ ~ Decreases in mucosal enzym...|$|R
40|$|Summary An {{intravenously}} administered fluorescent carbocyanine dye, DiOC 7 (3), {{has been}} evaluated {{for use in}} conjunction with Hoechst 33342 as a marker of murine tumour vasculature. DiOC 7 (3) stains cells immediately adjacent to blood vessels and thus, like Hoechst 33342, outlines perfused tumour vasculature. The different fluorescence excitation and emission properties of DiOC 7 (3) and Hoechst 33342 permit discrimination of the stains in the same tissue section. Mice tolerate a DiOC 7 (3) dose of 1 mg kg- i. v. with no ill effects. The dye has a distribution half-life in blood of 180 s and staining of perivascular tumour cells is sufficiently stable to allow visualisation of vasculature for up to 30 min after DiOC 7 (3) injection. However, DiOC 7 (3) causes a 75 % reduction in tumour blood flow as measured by laser Doppler techniques. Consequently, the compound appears to be most suitable as a second vascular marker, administered at some time after Hoechst 33342, to detect temporal and spatial fluctuations in tumour perfusion. Quantitative histological study of microvascular perfusion in solid experimental tumours can be undertaken using bloodborne stains or <b>tracer</b> <b>substances</b> which label the functional tumour vasculature. Substances confined exclusively to the vascular compartment, such as 51 Cr-labelled red blood cell...|$|R
