40|$|Summary Objective. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate and compare the flexural strength, dynamic elastic moduli and true hardness ðHoÞ values of commercial Vita In-Ceramw alumina core and Vita In-Ceramw matrix glass with the standard aluminous porcelain (Hi-Ceramw and Vitadurw), Vitadur Nw and Dicorw glass and glass-ceramic. Methods. The flexural strength was evaluated ðn 5 Þ using 3 -point loading and a servo hydraulic Instron testing machine at a cross head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The density of the specimens ðn 3 Þ was measured by means of the water displacement technique. Dynamic Young’s shear and bulk moduli and Poisson’s ratio ðn 3 Þ were measured using a non-destructive ultrasonic technique using 10 MHz lithium niobate crystals. The true hardness ðn 3 Þ was measured using a Knoop indenter and the fracture toughness ðn 3 Þ was determined using a Vickers indenter and a <b>Tukon</b> <b>hardness</b> tester. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using ANOVA and a Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) rank order multiple comparative test. Results. The SNK rank order test analysis of the mean flexural strength was able to separate five commercial core materials into three significant groups at p 0 : 05 : Vita In-Ceramw alumina and IPS Empressw 2 exhibited significantly higher flexural strength than aluminous porcelains and IPS Empressw at p 0 : 05 : The dynamic elastic moduli and true hardness of Vita In-Ceramw alumina core were significantly higher {{than the rest of the}} commercial ceramic core materials at p 0 : 05 : Significance. The ultrasonic test method is a valuable mechanical characterization tool and was able to statistically discriminate between the chemical and structural differences within dental ceramic materials. Significant correlation was obtained between the dynamic Young’s modulus and true hardness, p 0 : 05...|$|E

Failures of such materials {{have occurred in the}} past caused in large part by loss in strength due to crazing of the material. Such failures can be held to a m 3 nimum only by constant inspection and replacement of doubMtil. pats. Materials. of the type reported on hereFn are being used as pressurized aircraft glazing and have exhibited improved crazing resistance. Thie Investigation was conducted by the National Bureau of Standards to provide 6 ome pweical data concerning these materials 80 that such Fnformation might be available to potential user 8 in-the aircraft lJ.
