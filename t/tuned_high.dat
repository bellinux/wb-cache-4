25|$|The tuning chiefly {{employed}} on the Portuguese guitar was historically called afinação do fado or afinação do fado corrido. It {{was probably}} {{developed in the}} early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's fadistas by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either afinação de Lisboa, when <b>tuned</b> <b>high,</b> in D, or afinação de Coimbra, when tuned low, in C; this {{stems from the fact}} that while most Lisbon fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a C is called D, a D is called E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a transposing instrument similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a whole step higher than the note name that concert-pitch conventions would use).|$|E

The approached used is Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) of 1319 nm and 1064 nm lines of Nd:YAG in an LBO crystal. High power narrow line sources are not commercially available, so low power narrow-band NPRO sources are mated with resonantly <b>tuned</b> <b>high</b> power ring lasers to achieve high power pumps. Efficient conversion of 589 nm requires high pump intensities within the LBO crystal, therefore a doubly-resonant ring cavity is used. Four implementations of the Pound-Drever-Hall method are applied to achieve these. Finally, precision wavelength tuning is required to generate the correct wavelength as measured by a Wavemeter and verified by a low pressure Na-cell. These multiple control loops are all interconnected, to some degree, with various physical requirements, constraints, and caveats. Like any worthwhile project, the systems integration of the control systems has been an educational endeavor.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Applications in {{data science}} rely on two {{computing}} paradigms: <b>tuned</b> <b>high</b> performance parallel programs and data analytics. While historically their differences were {{good reason to}} separate the paradigms into different systems, recent changes in hardware and, as a result, fast data processing techniques, call this separation into question. The goal of this dissertation is to present systems and experiments that combine high performance parallel programs and data analytics for performance while preserving programmability. First, I present Grappa, a distributed parallel programming language implementation designed for building high performance data-intensive systems with less effort. Grappa provides a simple fine-grained programming model, while using the parallelism inherent in data-intensive applications to execute the program efficiently. Using Grappa we built native applications, and domain-specific frameworks for dataflow processing, graph processing, and relational query processing that are faster than their domain-specific counterparts. Then, I present a survey on techniques for fast in-memory query evaluation. Using existing literature, I classified overheads in the conventional techniques for query evaluation and techniques that address them. In particular, I focus on query compilation, which specializes the query processor to the particular query. These ideas inspire {{the design of the}} second system. Finally, I present Radish, a query processing engine built upon Grappa. Radish uses efficient distributed data structures, avoids extra messages, and uses Grappa’s runtime to execute fine-grained, tuple-by-tuple evaluation efficiently. I also developed a new query compilation technique that generates parallel code for entire processing pipelines. This compilation technique increased performance by 2. 4 × compared to generating fragments of code. Radish is also competitive with other distributed parallel data processing systems. In this dissertation, I provide supporting evidence for my thesis statement: When applied to data-intensive applications, high-performance parallel systems and new database query evaluation techniques support improved performance, programmer productivity, and closer interaction between handwritten parallel programs and declarative queries...|$|E
40|$|The Solent Group in the Hampshire Basin UK {{comprises}} over 200 m of clays, silts, limestones and infrequent {{sands of}} Late Eocene-Early Oligocene age deposited in continental (fluvatile and lacustrine facies with many palaeosols), estuarine and rarely shallow marine facies. The accumulation rate was rapid (40 - 60 m/Ma), and the succession displays conspicuous sequence-scale sea-level cycles (10 - 30 m) representing transitions from transgressive shallow marine/estuarine envrionments through brackish floodplain highstands to ephemeral freshwater carbonate lakes representing lowstands. Stratigraphy {{has traditionally been}} based on mammals and charophytes, although a number of levels provide sufficient nannofossils to identify NP Zones. We have used these important horizons, {{in conjunction with a}} new magnetostratigraphy, to correlate with the global chronostratigraphical scale. Although the succession is not conspicuously cyclic on the scale of bedding, high-resolution clay mineralogy and elemental geochemistry display striking cyclical changes on several frequencies. We have chosen one parameter, the percentage of illite and illite-smectite in the clay fraction of the sediment, to investigate orbital controls on the succession. Illite/illite smectite in this succession is neoformed in gley palaeosols, and was formed by repeated wetting and drying of the sediment in response to strongly contrasting seasons (ie high seasonality). There is a strong correlation between illite abundance and the occurrence of the pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea, which has a selective advantage in ephemeral ponds because it can breathe air. Because the orbital configuration which maximises seasonality has high eccentricity and obliquity values, we <b>tuned</b> <b>high</b> illite values to eccentricity maxima, and hypothesised that conspicuous groups of high illite peaks correspond with long eccentricity (400 Ka) maxima. We anchored this age model to the global chronostratigraphical scale using magnetic chrons; C 13 n (base of chron) and C 15 n (top of chron) and the results compared closely with published timescales for this interval. Filters of the tuned dataset recovered convincing short eccentricity (100 Ka) and obliquity (41 Ka) signals, but little evidence of precession. Spectral analysis using the Blackman-Tukey method demonstrated eccentricity, obliquity and precession peaks, and supports our assumption that major variations in clay mineralogy are linked to the long eccentricity cycles. An important conclusion {{of this study is that}} the sequence-scale changes, reflecting the major sea-level changes, are directly related to the 400 Ka cycle, and presumably were responses to changes in volume of Antarctic ice cover. A major hypothesised ice-growth event in the Early Oligocene has been interpreted by various authors from a heavy oxygen isotope shift approximately coincident with the base of chron 13 n. The corresponding level in the UK does not display any evidence of significant sea-level change in the coastal plain deposits of the Isle of Wight...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{complete}} {{the development of the}} laser systems and separator systems needed to investigate the potential for the economical separation of high value isotopes used in medical and industrial applications, then demonstrate this separation capability. The project was to focus on the isotopic purification of lead for use as solder in high- end electronics, and on the isotopic enrichment of thallium for medical applications. Ultimately the goal is to demonstrate the economical and technical viability of the technology for lead and thallium and to develop a more general capability for other possible isotope separation missions. Both lead and thallium are usefulapplications in this context because they require- dye lasers, solid- state lasers, and a frequency doubling capability of some of the lasers. This later capability allows access to the wavelength range 250 to 450 mn, with tunable, high- power and high repetition frequency lasers. Until recently, these wavelengths have been largely inaccessible in combination with these other laser characteristics. In addition, up to two new potential laser- isotope separation applications would be conceptually developed through a process of needs analysis and technical feasibility studies. Because of an unanticipated reduction {{in the size of the}} LDRD pool of funds, it was decided not to fully fund this project. However, enough funds were allocated to allow an orderly closeout of the project activities. Two key technical steps in the laser development were accomplished during the closeout phase, both of which are required for lead and thallium isotope separation. The first accomplishment successfully demonstrated the power scalability of a master- oscillator, power amplifier (MOPA) approach to a high- power Ti- sapphire laser host material. The net result output power produced, after a series of amplification stages, was about 50 W of tunable (red) laser light. In addition, the output power showed no signs of power saturation as the input power was varied. The demonstration verified the design intent of the amplifiers as well as that of the host material. This result is suggestive that greater than 100 W should easily be achievable from this laser architecture. Such powers are likely required for many applications such as efficient frequency doubling of red radiation to obtain blue, or near UV radiation, and for medium to large- scale isotope separation. The second accomplishment was the successful demonstration of a dye master oscillator that pulse- amplified, at pulse repetition frequencies greater than 10, 000 pulses per second, an injected continuous- wave input signal with low- signal gains greater than 500. This is important to potential isotope separation missions (and other applications) that require narrowly- <b>tuned,</b> <b>high</b> pulse repetition frequency dye laser light and would normally be the first step in a dye MOPA chain to achieve the required high average power. As part of this demonstration the low signal gain was measured as a function of pump pulse power and injected signal strength. Both measurements are required in order to specify the requirements for an eventual system that uses such a master oscillator...|$|E
