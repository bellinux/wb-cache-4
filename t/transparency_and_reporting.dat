40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in the Primary Health Care-PHC agenda is a common element {{of the majority of}} recent health system reforms throughout Latin America and the Caribbean-LAC. Strengthening of PHC has been recognized as a promising solution to address the major challenges the Region's health systems face. As governments are making substantive long term investments in PHC oriented healthcare reforms, there is a requirement for accountability and increased <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on the results of these initiatives. As a consequence, implementation of PHC strategies needs to be accompanied with mechanisms to collect data that will allow assessment {{of the extent to which}} primary care processes are being implemented and on their impact of quality, efficiency, cost, equity and consumer satisfaction. The Johns Hopkins Primary Care Assessment Tool or PCAT is amongst the instruments currently available to assess performance of PHC in several dimensions and from the perspective of users, practitioners, and systems. The purpose of this technical document is to provide a description of this instrument including its composition, measurement, functions, uses, and requirements to deploy the tool in practical applications and to discuss the challenges and opportunities to use the tool in the context of the LAC Region. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionCase {{reports have}} been a long held {{tradition}} within the surgical literature. Reporting guidelines can improve <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. However, recent consensus-based guidelines for case reports (CARE) are not surgically focused. Our objective was to develop surgical case report guidelines. MethodsThe CARE statement {{was used as the}} basis for a Delphi consensus. The Delphi questionnaire was administered via Google Forms and conducted using standard Delphi methodology. A multidisciplinary group of surgeons and others with expertise in the reporting of case reports were invited to participate. In round one, participants stated how each item of the CARE statement should be changed and what additional items were needed. Revised and additional items from round one were put forward into a further round, where participants voted on the extent of their agreement with each item, using a nine-point Likert scale, as proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) working group. ResultsIn round one, there was a 64 % (38 / 59) response rate. Following adjustment of the guideline with the incorporation of recommended changes, round two commenced and there was an 83 % (49 / 59) response rate. All but one of the items were approved by the participants, with Likert scores 7 – 9 awarded by > 70 % of respondents. The final guideline consists of a 14 -item checklist.

40|$|The {{police are}} {{authorized}} {{to use force}} {{in order to protect}} the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. Since this authorization implies that they are also expected to respect these values and basic human rights while performing their police function, the use of force is not a black-and-white issue. Although there has been plenty of academic attention given to the factors that determine proper use of force by the police, most research in this field is based on police experiences abroad (such as in the US). The aim of this article is to gain insight into the type of force that is most frequently used by Belgian police officers in their daily activities, and to examine the individual and contextual triggers that result in using force. First, the results of an online survey of police officers in three local police zones are presented. Second, qualitative data are used to gain more insight into the factors, individual as well as contextual, that influence the decision to use force. Results show that, according to Belgian police officers, individual and contextual aspects determine the use of force. The authors conclude that police officers should be provided not only with training on typical situations, but also with training to handle unpredictable cases, as well as individual coaching and aftercare. Increased <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> of the use of force and evolutions thereof could provide basic information to develop training, coaching and aftercare...|$|E

Reporting guidelines can improve <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. No guideline exists for reporting case series, and our recent systematic review highlights the fact that key data are being missed from such reports. Our objective was to develop reporting guidelines for surgical case series. MethodsA Delphi consensus exercise was conducted to determine items {{to include in the}} reporting guideline. Items included those identified from a previous systematic review on case series and those included in the SCARE Guidelines for case reports. The Delphi questionnaire was administered via Google Forms and conducted using standard Delphi methodology. Surgeons and others with expertise in the reporting of case series were invited to participate. In round one, participants voted to define case series and also what elements should be included in them. In round two, participants voted on what items to include in the PROCESS guideline using a nine-point Likert scale to assess agreement as proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) working group.

40|$|In September 2015 the United Nations Assembly {{established}} an Agenda 2030 made of 17 Sustainable Development Goals to fight poverty and promote human development. • SDG number 7 recites: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”. For SDG 7, {{as well as}} for the other SDGs, a system of targets and indicators has been set, to allow monitoring the steps toward the goals. • There is one main unsolved problem with Goal 7, and with other Goals. Responsibility for progress has been set at the country level, and monitoring is mainly national. The most difficult task lies in low income countries, where governments do not have sufficient resources to reach the goals by themselves, and even monitoring is weak. • International cooperation is included in the system of targets and indicators, yet mostly in qualitative terms; official development aid is the main variable, directly related to the Goal, that can be measured and for which responsibility is assigned. • We know from reliable sources that Goal number 7 is not being met and that it is highly likely that the problem will remain beyond the year 2030. • A special effort is required. Monitored action should be much broader than official aid. As in the case of climate policies, targets cannot be imposed on independent states and, were they set, no credible system of sanctions would make them mandatory. • New ways to pursue the Goal must be found. A possible solution lies in a set of voluntary commitments plus <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations, similar to the one introduced in the Paris COP 21 for climate policy. It could allow inclusion of the private sector, partner in the Global Compact, into a joint responsibility mechanism...|$|E

The paper {{includes}} the presentation and {{discussion on the}} proceeding rules regarding {{the approval of the}} remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright and related rights within proceedings conducted by adjudicating panels of the Copyright Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights of 4 February 1994. The Copyright Commission conducts the proceedings essentially based on the provisions amended by the Constitutional Tribunal in its judgment of 24 January 2006 case file SK 40 / 04, in which it ruled on the unconstitutionality of Article 108 (3) of the aforementioned Act on Copyright regarding proceedings before the Commission on the approval of the remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright or performances submitted by collective management organizations. As a result of the amendment, the binding regulations provide for defining the scope of proceeding before the Commission on the approval of rates submitted by collective management organizations with ensuring, in case of contesting a Commission’s decision, the possibility to continue the proceedings before a general court. In the legislation the participation of parties in determining the composition of the adjudicating panel of the Commission, the introduction of restrictions on the length of proceedings and the opportunity to challenge a decision of the adjudicating panel of the Commission by filing a relevant application to the participant and to submit the case to court were exposed. In the assessment of the proceeding concerning the approval of remuneration tables for objects of copyright or related rights, its consistency and compatibility with the concepts of the modern settlement of disputes were indicated. Additionally, the compliance of the provisions with the EU law standards laid down in the latest EU legislation was underlined, including regulations aimed at ensuring the coordination of national provisions concerning the conditions for copyright and related rights management by collective management organizations to ensure a high level of management, <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> according to the objectives of Directive 2014 / 26 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market.
