40|$|In {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s literary texts, ideologies aligning {{readers with}} discourses of certain communities often remain uncontested, potentially privileging those views and values over others. Critical literacy, therefore, is important so children can contest positions taken in literary texts and consider how their own texts in turn position others. This inquiry examined redesign as a pedagogical approach for developing critical literacy with 12 year old {{students as they}} deconstructed messages they identified in a short film and then reconstructed alternative viewpoints with new digital literary texts (redesigns). Findings revealed that the redesign cycle supported learners as they moved {{through a process of}} interpreting the <b>text,</b> <b>critiquing</b> ideologies they perceived and then working to imagine new perspectives and alternate viewpoints in their own literary text creations. This paper explores the implications for supporting learners with different critical literacy skills to develop those skills and express their understandings through the creation of digital literary texts...|$|E

40|$|Understanding argumentation and {{its role}} in human {{reasoning}} has been a continuous subject of investigation for scholars from the ancient Greek philosophers to current researchers in philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence. In recent years, argumentation models have been used in different areas such as knowledge representation, explanation, proof elaboration, commonsense reasoning, logic programming, legal reasoning, decision making, and negotiation. However, these models address quite specific needs and there is need for a conceptual framework that would organize and compare existing argumentation-based models and methods. Such a framework would be very useful 1 especially for researchers and practitioners who want to select appropriate argumentation models or techniques to be incorporated in new software systems with argumentation capabilities. In this paper, we propose such a conceptual framework, based on taxonomy of the most important argumentation models, approaches and systems found in the literature. This framework highlights the similarities and differences between these argumentation models. As an illustration of the practical use of this framework, we present a case study which shows how we used this framework to select and enrich an argumentation model in a knowledge acquisition project which aimed at representing argumentative knowledge contained in <b>texts</b> <b>critiquing</b> military courses of action...|$|R

40|$|Postcolonial {{literary}} critics note persistently recurring representations of colonial violence in post-independence Anglophone African novels. I suggest that complex psychological and political processes of colonial trauma compel this narrative repetition. This dissertation juxtaposes postcolonial and trauma studies {{in order to}} analyze literary representations of colonial violence in terms of race, gender, identity, and the post-independence nation-state. To do so, I engage with black feminisms, African history, Subaltern Studies, and Latin American testimonio studies. I contend that, despite variations in aesthetic mode, melancholia, haunting, and mourning recur in realist and postmodern Anglophone African and diaspora novels with interesting variations beyond the usual stylistic differences. This tendency spans sub-Saharan Africa, the Atlantic, and generations. My work suggests that we use the vocabulary of psychoanalysis to fruitfully read post-independence literature as testimony representing the trauma of colonial occupation. Trauma and justice studies teach that testimony is the route to surviving productively after an experience of traumatizing violence. While mine {{is not the first}} analysis of Anglophone African literature to employ the vocabulary of psychoanalysis, it is the first to suggest doing so in the context of traumatic testimony. I explore three modes of telling [...] testimonial bodies, censored testimony and its ghosts, and trans-generational testifying wounds [...] represented in Ayi Kwei Armah's Fragments (Ghana, the United States, and France), Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions (Zimbabwe), Nuruddin Farah's Maps (Somalia), Moses Isegawa's Abyssinian Chronicles (Uganda and the Netherlands), Meja Mwangi's Carcase for Hounds (Kenya), Helen Oyeyemi's The Icarus Girl (Nigeria and Britain), and in Zoë Wicomb's David's Story and J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace (South Africa). Modes of telling crisscross the continent, suggesting that traumatic suffering binds different communities together. Read as traumatic testimonies, the <b>texts</b> <b>critique</b> the intersected, normalizing discourses of globalization, trans-Atlantic migration, women's rights, and decolonization. They demonstrate that moments of national birth mark historical sites of potential for the collective to revise the past, create a national citizenry, and chart a socially progressive future through transformative mourning processes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the works of}} three British, women Romantic writers {{in relation to the}} social and medical constructions of maternity. It is founded on the supposition that images of the maternal body are used to serve a variety of political and ideological goals. The introduction discusses the attempt to recover the lost texts and voices of past literary women, and then shows how maternity intersected with the rhetoric of sensibility prevalent within Romanticism and the ideology of separate spheres. In the second chapter, Mary Shelley 2 ̆ 7 s Frankenstein: or the Modern Prometheus is placed {{within the context of the}} professional rivalry between medical men and midwives. It is asserted that Shelley 2 ̆ 7 s <b>text</b> <b>critiques</b> the male usurpation of female, reproductive power, while also revealing an autobiographical anxiety concerning motherhood. Chapter three discusses the works of Ann Yearsley, and how she used her maternal subject position to claim an authority to speak out against class tyranny, oppression and violence. Yearsley 2 ̆ 7 s works are put in the context of the French Revolution and the politics of breast-feeding that played out in both France and Britain. Chapter four discusses the poetry of Felicia Hemans. It is argued that the death of the maternal body found so frequently in her works was an artistic response to the increased deaths of women in childbed in the early nineteenth-century.

40|$|Novel: Fragments of a Former Moon The novel Fragments of a Former Moon (FFM) {{invokes the}} {{paradoxical}} earlier {{death of the}} still-living protagonist. The unmarried German woman is told that her skeletal remains have been discovered in Israel, thirty-eight years since her body was interred in 1967. This absurd premise raises issues of representing death in contemporary culture; death's destabilising effect on the individual's textual representation; post-Enlightenment dissolution of the modern rational self; and problems of mimetic post-Holocaust representation. Using W G Sebald's fiction {{as a point of}} departure, FFM's photographic illustrations connote modes of textual representation that disrupt the autobiographical self, invoking mortality and its a-temporal (representational) displacement. As with Sebald's recurring references to the Holocaust, FFM depicts a psychologically unstable protagonist seeking to recover repressed memories of an absent past. Research dissertation: Metonymy &Trauma: Re-presenting Death in the Literature of W. G. Sebald. The dissertation centres on the effect of metonymy in the rhetoric of textually-constructed identity and its contemporary representation in the face of death. I concentrate on the effect of Holocaust trauma on representation and memory, relating trauma theory to the metonymy of W G Sebald's fiction, and situating representations of the traumatised self within the institution of modern bureaucracy. Using Ronald Schleifer's theory of metonymy I explore the rhetorical process by which Sebald seeks to depict the unrepresentable within Holocaust history, arguing that Sebald's correlation of text with image evokes problems of Holocaust discourse because it re-presents the past while recognising inadequacies within conventional narrative. Photography's function as an indexical trace of the past grounds my account of Sebald's use of imagery in questioning conventional forms of representation. I argue that Sebald construes the institutionalised constitution of the modern self through civic architecture, emphasising the metonymical associations of contemporary Western life and death. I maintain ultimately that the ethically displaced modern self typifies a culture capable of committing - and simultaneously repressing the representation - of technologised mass genocide: Sebald's <b>texts</b> <b>critique</b> modern society by apprehending modes of intersubjective memory and narrative responsibility through acknowledgement of the arbitrary, indexical capacity of metonymical representation...|$|R

The work falls into two parts, representing two approaches that reflect and complement each other.
