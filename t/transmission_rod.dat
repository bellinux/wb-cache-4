40|$|For {{photovoltaic}} applications multicrystalline silicon {{is produced}} by directional solidification of large silicon melts. One of the quality determining parameters is the uniformity of the solidification velocity. In order to control the velocity, in situ observation of the solid/liquid interface position is essential. Ultrasonic techniques appear to be suited best because X-ray radiography is problematic in production processes. In this paper a special ultrasonic technique will be discussed and experiments in a solidification process for 24 kg ingots will be reported. The ultrasonic signal is generated and received by the same piezoelectric transducer. As direct contact of the transducer with the silicon melt is impossible, a <b>transmission</b> <b>rod</b> is used. It is dipped into the melt {{at one end and}} is bearing the transducer at its cold end. This rod is the most critical part of the system. Several materials were under consideration and some of them were tested. Clear echoes from the solid/li quid interface were received with transmission rods made of SiC, Alsub 2 Osub 3 and monocrystalline Si. The actual position of the interface is calculated from time differences between the echoes from the hot end of the <b>transmission</b> <b>rod</b> and the echoes from the solid/liquid interface...|$|E

This system uses a parabolic dish {{to collect and}} concentrate the sunlight which is then further guided by a transparent rod and finally by individual short fibres. Eventually, the individual fibres are connected to single cells which are located indoors. Dual-junction III-V-based solar cells with an efficiency of 30 % and operating at 1000 x are applied in the PV-FIBRE system. This new system approach allows a suitable optical and electrical interconnection {{in order to reduce}} the losses and the indoor operation of the cell receiver. All elements of the CPV system (collector, tracker, <b>transmission</b> <b>rod,</b> cells, fibre bundles, and cooling circuit) have been manufactured according to main design requirements and have been evaluated separately. Finally, the PV-FIBRE CPV system has been installed in Madrid and tested under real operation conditions. The system has demonstrated an optical efficiency of 62 % is feasible, providing homogeneous illumination to the cells. Therefore, this concept can lead to overall efficiencies exceeding 20 % when combined with MJ solar cells. In this paper we report on the main achievements, identified problems as well as lessons learned and future research lines to improve the system performance...|$|E

Kinetic analysis of transducin (Gtαβγ) activation shows that an intermediary R*·Gtαβγ·GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*·G protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a Gtα C-terminal peptide (GαCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal α-helix of Gtα (α 5) and shows how α 5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them – termed stable or S-interaction – matches {{the position of the}} GαCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GαCT and conserved E(D) RY and NPxxY(x) 5, 6 F regions of the GPCR. The alternative fit – termed intermediary or I-interaction – is distinguished by a tilt (42 °) and rotation (90 °) of α 5 relative to the S-interaction and shows different α 5 contacts with the NPxxY(x) 5, 6 F region and the second cytoplasmic loop of R*. From the 2 α 5 interactions, we derive a “helix switch” mechanism for the transition of R*·Gtαβγ·GDP to the nucleotide-free R*·G protein complex that illustrates how α 5 might act as a <b>transmission</b> <b>rod</b> to propagate the conformational change from the receptor-G protein interface to the nucleotide binding site...|$|E

Knockout of Cplx 3 strongly attenuated fast, phasic Ca 2 +-dependent transmission, dependent on local [Ca 2 +] nanodomains, but enhanced slower Ca 2 +-dependent transmission, dependent on global intraterminal [Ca 2 +] ([Ca 2 +]I). Surprisingly, coordinated multivesicular release persisted at Cplx 3 −/− synapses, although its onset was slowed. Light-dependent signaling at Cplx 3 −/− RB→AII synapses was sluggish, owing largely to increased asynchronous release at light offset. Consequently, propagation of RB output to retinal ganglion cells was suppressed dramatically.

40|$|Using a {{multidisciplinary}} approach, we demonstrate that three different pathways {{are responsible for}} the <b>transmission</b> of <b>rod</b> signals across the mouse retina. Each pathway serves a primarily nonoverlapping range of stimulus intensities, with ganglion cells receiving either segregated or convergent inputs. For both on-center (ON) and off-center (OFF) ganglion cells, the primary rod pathway carries signals with the lowest threshold, whereas the secondary rod pathway is less sensitive by approximately 1 log unit. In addition, OFF signaling uses a tertiary rod pathway that is approximately 1 log unit less sensitive than the secondary. Although some ganglion cells received rod inputs exclusively from one of the pathways, others showed convergent inputs. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we defined classes of ON and OFF ganglion cells for which the scotopic inputs derive only from the primary pathway or from both primary and secondary pathways. In addition, we observed a class of OFF ganglion cell receiving mixed input from primary and tertiary pathways. Interestingly, OFF ganglion cells receiving convergent inputs from all three rod pathways or from the secondary and tertiary pathways together were never observed. Overall, our data show a complex arrangement of convergence and segregation of rod inputs to ganglion cells in the mammalian retina...|$|R

40|$|Our {{visual system}} {{operates}} over an astoundingly {{wide dynamic range}} that covers over 10 orders of magnitude, with light environments ranging from the near dark twilight to the bright noonday sun. Rod photoreceptors function over the lowest 8 orders of magnitude of our visual range and encode our most sensitive vision. In the mammalian retina, rod signals are relayed to a single class of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and {{form the basis for}} the rod bipolar pathway. Adaptive processes are key to integrating rod photoresponses into the retinal circuitry and establishing the wide dynamic range of rod vision. Adaptation is known to occur both presynaptically in rods and postsynaptically in RBCs. However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to adaptation is not clear. Overall, my thesis projects explore the fundamental processes that modulate synaptic transmission in retinal circuits, particularly between rods and rod bipolar cells. I recorded light-evoked responses from rods and RBCs of wildtype and several transgenic mouse strains using single-cell patch clamp methods, and analyze response sensitivity under dark-adapted conditions and during light adaptation. My first goal was to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of rod-to-RBC synapses. In collaboration with the laboratory of Kirill A. Martemyanov (The Scripps Research Institute), we found that the rod-specific cell adhesion molecular ELFN 1 interacts trans-synaptically with the postsynaptic receptor mGluR 6 on RBC dendrites, and that this interaction is required for high-sensitivity vision of the rod pathway. We also found that the extracellular calcium channel CaV 1. 4 subunit α 2 δ 4 forms complexes with ELFN 1 and bridges presynaptic calcium channels to postsynaptic mGluR 6 channels. Experiments in mice lacking α 2 δ 4 reveal that this subunit is crucial for calcium-channel voltage sensitivity and rod-to-RBC synaptic transmission. A key process in adaptation involves the movement of several signaling molecules in rod photoreceptors. One such molecule, the G-protein transducin, translocates to the rod inner segment and synaptic terminal in the light, and this process enhances synaptic <b>transmission</b> between <b>rods</b> and RBCs. Our next goal was to identify the mechanism of transducin modulation of rod-to-RBC signal transmission. In collaboration with the laboratory of Nikolai O. Artemyev (University of Iowa), we examined the functional role of the cargo protein UNC 119, which is important for transducin translocation. We describe a novel function for UNC 119 as an enhancer of synaptic <b>transmission</b> between <b>rods</b> and RBCs. Lastly, I explored the biophysical mechanisms that control the responsiveness of RBCs over a wide range of light intensities. My preliminary data suggest that intracellular calcium acts on two targets in RBCs to increase the sensitivity and temporal resolution of RBC responses. This study is part of an ongoing effort in the lab. Together, these projects provide insight into fundamental properties of signaling at the rod-to-RBC synapse, both presynaptically and postsynaptically, that permit the large dynamic range of rod vision...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Responses to {{flashes and}} steps of light were {{recorded}} intracellularly from rods and horizontal cells, and extracellularly from ganglion cells, in toad eyecups which were either dark adapted or exposed to {{various levels of}} background light. The average background intensities needed to depress the dark-adapted flash sensitivity by half in the three cell types, determined under identical conditions, were 0. 9 Rh*s- 1 (rods), 0. 8 Rh*s-I (horizontal cells), and 0. 17 Rh*s- 1 (ganglion cells), where Rh * denotes one isomerization per rod. Thus, there is a range (- 0. 7 log units) of weak backgrounds where the sensitivity (response amplitude/ Rh*) of rods is not significantly affected, but where that of ganglion cells (1 / threshold) is substantially reduced, which implies that the gain of the <b>transmission</b> from <b>rods</b> to the ganglion cell output is decreased.

We propose that this type of ganglion cell desensitization under dim backgrounds is due to a postreceptoral gain control driven by quantal fluctuations, and term it noise adaptation in contrast to the Weber adaptation (desensitization proportional to the mean background intensity) of rods, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells at higher background intensities...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{transmission}} from cones {{is faster}} than <b>transmission</b> from <b>rods.</b> Using paired simultaneous recordings from photoreceptors and second-order neurones in the salamander retina, we studied {{the contributions of}} rod–cone differences in glutamate receptor properties and synaptic release rates to shaping postsynaptic responses. Depolarizing steps evoked sustained calcium currents in rods and cones that in turn produced transient excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in horizontal and OFF bipolar cells. Cone-driven EPSCs rose and decayed faster than rod-driven EPSCs, even when comparing inputs from a rod and cone onto the same postsynaptic neurone. Thus, rod–cone differences in EPSCs reflect properties of individual rod and cone synapses. Experiments with selective AMPA and KA agonists and antagonists showed that rods and cones both contact pharmacologically similar AMPA receptors. Spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) exhibited unimodal distributions of amplitude and half-amplitude time width {{and there were no}} rod–cone differences in mEPSC properties. To examine how release kinetics shape the EPSC, we convolved mEPSC waveforms with empirically determined release rate functions for rods and cones. The predicted EPSC waveform closely matched the actual EPSC evoked by cones, supporting a quantal release model at the photoreceptor synapse. Convolution with the rod release function also produced a good match in rod-driven cells, although the actual EPSC was often somewhat slower than the predicted EPSC, a discrepancy partly explained by rod–rod coupling. Rod–cone differences in the rates of exocytosis are thus a major factor in producing faster cone-driven responses in second-order retinal neurones...|$|R

40|$|Many neurons in the {{mammalian}} retina are electrically {{coupled by}} intercellular channels or gap junctions, which are assembled {{from a family}} of proteins called connexins. Numerous studies indicate that gap junctions differ in properties such as conductance and tracer permeability. For example, A-type horizontal cell gap junctions are permeable to Lucifer Yellow, but B-type horizontal cell gap junctions are not. This suggests the two cell types express different connexins. My hypothesis is that multiple neuronal connexins are expressed in the mammalian retina in a cell type specific manner. Immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy were used to localize certain connexins within well-defined neuronal circuits. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: AII amacrine cells, which receive direct input from rod bipolar cells, are well-coupled to neighboring AIIs. In addition, AII amacrine cells also form gap junctions with ON cone bipolar cells. This is a complex heterocellular network. In both rabbit and primate retina, connexin 36 occurs at dendritic crossings in the AII matrix as well as between AIIs and ON cone bipolar cells. Coupling in the AII network is thought to reduce noise in the rod pathway while AII/bipolar gap junctions are required for the <b>transmission</b> of <b>rod</b> signals to ON ganglion cells. In the outer plexiform layer, connexin 36 forms gap junctions between cones and between rods and cones via cone telodendria. Cone to cone coupling is thought to reduce noise and is partly color selective. Rod to cone coupling forms an alternative rod pathway thought to operate at intermediate light intensity. A-type horizontal cells in the rabbit retina are strongly coupled via massive low resistance gap junctions composed from Cx 50. Coupling dramatically extends the receptive field of horizontal cells and the modulation of coupling is thought to change the strength of the feedback signal from horizontal cells to cones. Finally, there are other coupled networks, such as B-type horizontal cells and S 1 /S 2 amacrine cells, which do not use either connexin 36 or Cx 50. These results confirm the hypothesis that multiple neuronal connexins are expressed in the mammalian retina and these connexins are localized to particular retinal circuits. ...|$|R
40|$|Signal <b>transmission</b> between <b>rods</b> and cones was {{studied by}} passing current into a rod and {{recording}} the voltage response {{in a nearby}} double or single cone and vice versa. Two types of rod-cone interaction were found. Between immediately adjacent rods and cones, passage of current into either receptor elicited in the other receptor a sustained voltage response of the same sign as the injected current. These signals were still seen {{in the presence of}} Co 2 +, and are probably mediated by the electrical synapses which have been seen anatomically between adjacent rods and cones. In addition to this short-range sign-preserving interaction, passing current into a rod elicited a transient sign-inverted signal in cones up to at least 80 micron from the injected rod. No such response was seen in rods for current injection into cones. This signal was greatly reduced by Co 2 + ions. Hyperpolarization of the cone to about - 65 mV, with about 0. 1 nA current, reversed this signal, which is presumed to be mediated by a chemical synaptic input to cones. Light flashes suppressed the sign-inverted signal for a period which was longer for brighter flashes. The time of reappearance of the signal was correlated with the return of the rod and horizontal cell potentials to their dark levels. This suppression could also be produced by an annulus of light which produced no light response in the receptors at the centre of the annulus, but which did polarize horizontal cells under the centre of the annulus. The wave form of the sign-inverted signal was similar to that produced in horizontal cells by current injection into rods, but of opposite sign. If an electrode was left in a cone for some time, the normal hyperpolarizing light response diminished, leaving a depolarizing response produced, presumably, by feed-back from horizontal cells. This signal was reversed when the cone was hyperpolarized with about 0. 1 nA current. These data suggest that the sign-inverted response is mediated by feed-back from horizontal cells and, assuming that depolarization increases the rate of release of horizontal cell synaptic transmitter, then the feed-back transmitter opens channels in the cone membrane whose currents have a reversal potential around - 65 mV...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Retina organ {{cultures}} {{can be used}} as {{a valuable}} tool to study retina development ex vivo. Comparison between culture methods has revealed that timing the start of the culture and the presence of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are critical for the development of the rods and cones, which are the two types of photoreceptors; rods can develop in the absence of the RPE, cones cannot. One of the necessary compounds produced by the RPE and essential for cone development and survival is the chromophore 11 -cis retinal. Here, we further examined rod and cone development, chromophore production by the RPE, and photoreceptor signaling to the inner retina under organ culture conditions. Methods: Retina-RPE cultures were prepared from 7 -day-old C 57 BL/ 6 pups and maintained in culture for 11 days. Rod and cone structure was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. We quantified 11 -cis retinal spectrophotometrically by measuring rhodopsin. Signal <b>transmission</b> in the <b>rod</b> pathway was studied by analyzing c-fos expression in the inner retina in response to stroboscopic illumination. Results: In retina-RPE cultures analyzed after 11 days in culture, rod and cone numbers exhibited a similar ratio to those observed in the intact animal. Although photoreceptor outer segments were shorter when grown ex vivo, membrane proteins, such as cone opsin and transducin, were localized appropriately to the outer segment. Relative 11 -cis retinal production ex vivo plateaued after 7 days in culture, resulting in approximately 30 % of the in vivo level by day 11. Th...|$|R
40|$|Photoreceptor {{cells are}} {{an example of}} {{biological}} transducer devices: they transform photon energy into an electrical signal and transmit it to higher-order neurons. Vertebrate photoreceptor cells can be categorized into two classes, rods and cones. The rod photoreceptors are extremely sensitive to light, whereas cones are faster than rods and can function under bright ambient illumination. The rod photoreceptor cell is a convenient model for studying modulation of physiological transduction and transmission processes because 1) the rod's natural input signal, light, can be applied quantitatively and 2) the absorption of only {{one or a few}} photons by the visual pigment molecules in the cell's outer segment is transformed into a measurable change of the rod's membrane potential (Vm). The gain of the photon-to-Vm conversion in rods is rapidly (in a fraction of a second) modulated by several ionic feedback mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in rod signal generation and feedback signaling were investigated in the present work by recording rods' electrical responses to light stimuli from intact mouse retinas with transretinal electroretinogram (ex vivo ERG). Several negative feedback mechanisms that accelerate a rod's response recovery after light stimuli rely on the light-induced decline in the calcium ion (Ca 2 +) concentration in the rod outer segment. Further, some voltage- and Ca 2 + -dependent mechanisms in the rod inner segment plasma membrane modulate the gain of the photon-to-Vm conversion. In this thesis the specificity of the known Ca 2 + signaling mechanisms, and Ca 2 + dependency of the reaction that rate-limits the rod's recovery after bright stimuli were investigated. It was found that the transition metal ion Co 2 + can mediate the known Ca 2 + dependent negative feedback mechanisms in the rod outer segment, and that a certain minimum amount of Ca 2 + is necessary in setting the physiological value of the speed of the rate-limiting recovery reaction. The role of the inner segment ionic channels in generating the rod ERG response was also elucidated. It was shown that the hyperpolarization activated (h) channels in the rod inner segment participate in the generation of a fast transient component that is evident in the rod ERG response to bright flashes. Instead, voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels or Ca 2 + -activated potassium and chloride currents did not contribute to that component. Additionally, modulation of the direct electrical <b>transmission</b> between <b>rods</b> and cones was studied. The present work suggests that the electrical connection between rods and cones can be closed by light in the mouse retina...|$|R
40|$|A new {{passive sensor}} for remote {{measurement}} of water content in sandy soil was designed, using a {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) reflective delay line. Information from this sensor {{can be obtained by}} an interrogation device via a radio link operating in the European 434 -MHz industrial-scientific-medical band. The SAW device, manufactured on the YZ cut of LiNbO 3, is mounted and sealed in a standard dual inline 16 package and contains four electroacoustic transducers. One transducer is connected to an external antenna to pick up an RF request signal from the interrogation device and to send back an RF response. The second transducer operates as a reflector. The bus bars of this transducer are connected with two measuring rods through an electrical <b>transmission</b> line. These <b>rods</b> can be inserted into sandy soil. The final two transducers operate as reflectors and are included for reference purposes. The transmission line and the two rods spanning the sand-water mixture have a ch aracteristic impedance Zload, which loads the second transducer. Changes in the soil water content are observed as a change of the total permittivity due to the high permittivity of free water, which, in turn, affects Zload as well. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic reflection at the second transducer changes due to a variation of the terminating Zload. This then results in a difference in attenuation and phase of the corresponding peak in the time domain. Thus, the RF response of the sensor carries information about the water content between the rods, which, therefore, can be detected by and evaluated in the interrogation unit...|$|R
40|$|Shot peening is {{normally}} used to increase fatigue resistance in rather small-sized mechanical parts (gears, <b>transmission</b> shafts, connecting <b>rods).</b> Residual stress induced by this treatment {{has been studied}} extensively in the past decade. SaIne automobile manufachlrers have recently introduced specifications concerning the depth of residual stress in gears. Most of the research done on this topic has made use of the X-ray diffraction method to de-termine residual stress. Because of the configuration of Pelton wheels, shot peened areas cannot be easily accessed with portable diffraction meters. For this reason, the authors have used the Barkhausen noise lnethod to measure residual stress and have then compared results before and after peening. The Barkhausen noise method was calibrated against Almen strips by X-ray diffraction and by hole drilling methods. 2 Shot Peening The purpose of shot peening is to increase fatigue resistance in mechanical parts. Essentially {{it is a process}} in which the surface of the part is bombarded with spherical particles made of the appropriate material and to the correct size. The impact of these spheres {{on the surface of the}} part causes a plastic deformation and creates "microcups " which are evident in the following SEMimage: This plastic deformation induces a state of compression which significantly increases resi-stance to fatigue. Obviously the performance of the part depends on the depth and on the value of compression. These variables (depth and value) are a function of shot peening procedure pa-ralneters, which are defined by intensity, shot size and coverage. Intensity is determined by measuring the effect of peening on an Almen strip, which is a har-dened C 70 steel strip tempered to 44 - 45 HRC; strip dimensions are indicated in the followin...|$|R
