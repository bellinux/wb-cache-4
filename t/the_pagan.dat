5|$|In the 13th century, <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Empire, {{along with}} the Khmer Empire, {{was one of the}} two main empires in {{mainland}} Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Dynasty itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pagans</b> {{have grown}} through merging with other smaller outlaw {{motorcycle}} gangs. Considered {{by law enforcement}} to be almost as complex and diversified as the Hells Angels, the discipline and structure of <b>the</b> <b>Pagans</b> is <b>the</b> most rigid of the Big Four motorcycle clubs. In <b>the</b> 1960s <b>the</b> <b>Pagans</b> were foot soldiers for George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party.|$|R

5|$|The term Wicca {{appears to}} have {{developed}} within <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Witchcraft community during the early 1960s, as increasing numbers of Pagan Witches learned of the Old English term wicca, the etymological origin of the Modern term witch. This etymological fact had been referred to five times in Gerald Gardner's book The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959), {{as well as in}} other early texts propagating Pagan Witchcraft, such as Doreen Valiente's Where Witchcraft Lives (1962) and Justine Glass' Witchcraft, The Sixth Sense – and Us (1965). None of these specifically referred to <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Witchcraft religion as Wicca.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pagans</b> {{have been}} linked to the {{production}} and smuggling of drugs such as methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and PCP. <b>The</b> <b>Pagans</b> also have had strong ties to organized crime, especially in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Pagans often use puppet clubs, smaller affiliated motorcycle clubs, or small street drug trafficking organizations that support larger outlaw motorcycle gangs for distributing drugs. Pagans have also engaged in assault, arson, extortion, motorcycle/car theft, and weapons trafficking. Most of the violence carried out by <b>the</b> <b>Pagans</b> is directed to rival gangs such as Hells Angels.|$|R
5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies {{as an academic}} discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious movements in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia {{during the first}} quarter of the seventh century, was the most {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first overlord who originated north of the Thames, <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> Penda of Mercia, emerged to challenge the pre-eminence of the new overlord (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The reversion of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E
5|$|Christianity was {{probably}} introduced {{to what is}} now Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> Anglo-Saxons advanced.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of the reign of Honorius, Stilicho was able to {{exercise}} unlimited power over the west.

5000|$|Violence {{erupts in}} Caesarea {{regarding}} the a local ordinance restricting {{the civil rights}} of Jews, creating clashes between Jews and <b>pagans.</b> <b>The</b> Roman garrison, made up of Syrians, takes the side of <b>the</b> <b>pagans.</b> <b>The</b> Jews, armed with clubs and swords, meet in the marketplace. The governor of Judea, Antonius Felix, orders his troops to charge. The violence continues and Felix asks Nero to arbitrate. Nero sides with <b>the</b> <b>pagans,</b> and relegates <b>the</b> Jews to second-class citizens. This decision does nothing but increase the Jews' anger.|$|R
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted their attention to <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory {{was used as a}} bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|Living in Brighton, Valiente took up {{employment}} in {{a branch of}} the Boots pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, she was involved in the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Front, a British pressure group that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she who developed the three principles that came to be central to <b>the</b> <b>Pagan</b> Front's interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pagan</b> Empire {{disintegrated}} and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, {{who probably}} preferred the situation, {{did nothing to}} restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond {{the capital city of}} Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300–01.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{followed}} by the Welshmen destroying <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> temples while the Aztecs gather to appoint a new king. Games and events are established and follow after the battle. During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to <b>the</b> <b>pagan</b> gods appear once again. This {{is followed by}} the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe {{that they do not have}} the support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and head south for Mexico.|$|E
