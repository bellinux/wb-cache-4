5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved <b>ticket</b> <b>sales.</b> That hypothesis was borne out as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased at a rapid pace. ACC officials and Charlotte boosters each said they {{were satisfied with the}} pace and quantity of <b>ticket</b> <b>sales.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high <b>ticket</b> <b>sales,</b> the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for <b>ticket</b> <b>sales.</b> The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony.
