Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all. Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews. He told Gilbert {{that he would never}} have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. [...] "I only <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government," [...] he claimed.|$|E
500|$|Gygax {{wrote the}} {{supplements}} Greyhawk, Eldritch Wizardry, and Swords & Spells {{for the original}} D game. With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game Boot Hill. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine The Strategic Review with himself as editor. But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical The Dragon, with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981). The Dragon debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: [...] "When I decided that The Strategic Review was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce The Dragon, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , {{we want it to be}} something special and different So we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool {{began the}} 1966–67 season by beating {{neighbours}} Everton in the FA Charity Shield match {{but the team}} were never really in contention for major honours that season, finishing fifth in the league. Shankly recognised the potential of Blackpool teenager Emlyn Hughes, a future England captain, and signed him for £65,000 in February 1967. Liverpool's performance in the 1966-67 European Cup was poor and, after struggling to overcome FC Petrolul Ploiesti in the first round, they were well beaten in the last 16 by Ajax, inspired by 19-year-old Johan Cruyff. Ajax won 7–3 on aggregate after defeating Liverpool 5–1 in Amsterdam. Several years later, in his autobiography, Shankly still complained that [...] "the match in Amsterdam should never have started" [...] due to fog and, although Liverpool lost 5–1, he [...] "still <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> (<b>would</b> win the tie) at Anfield". Although Shankly {{claimed to have been}} unworried about the Ajax defeat, he acknowledged that [...] "we were examining the team and planning ahead". However, the Liverpool site argues that Shankly was mistaken in his decision at this time to postpone team rebuilding.|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the band}} were equally {{polarized}} by A Thousand Suns. Initial signs of the fans' division over the band's new material occurred when [...] "The Catalyst" [...] was released as a single. MTV conducted a poll asking fans how they received the song; most responses were positive but a large amount were dissatisfied with it. Fans then therefore debated on {{what they thought of}} the new sound. Sara Ferrer of Orange County Reloaded said the album split the views of fans and critics into [...] "love-it versus hate-it groups". Montgomery expressed similar sentiments, saying the album [...] "alternately thrilled and thinned [...] substantial fanbase with its vast swaths of sonic sprawl (and overall lack of guitar solos)." [...] Shinoda shared his thoughts on the divided reception of the fans; he thanked the people who accepted the album and defended it from the criticism of those who disliked it. Commenting on fans' polarized response to the album, Bennington said, [...] " [...] is definitely something that we knew people would need to digest and get over the fact that it's not what they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} National Hockey League {{decided not to}} {{consider}} Houston {{as a location for}} an expansion team because of the indecision over the new arena, Lanier said that he would not have a referendum in November. The Rockets began an appeal in January 1998 against the court order to stay at the Summit, but then dropped it in May, because they felt that a new arena would be ready by the time they finished their lease. In January 1999, recently elected mayor Lee Brown guaranteed a referendum on the issue {{before the end of the}} year. After several months negotiating with the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, the Rockets finalized a deal to pay half of the constructions costs, and a referendum was set for November 2. The deal was approved by Brown and the Houston City Council, but Watson started an opposition group against the referendum, saying the arena was [...] "not in Houston's interest". On November 3, the results of the referendum were announced, and the arena proposal was rejected by 54% of voters. Alexander said [...] "we never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> lose" [...] and that they were [...] "devastated by the loss".|$|E

500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> ease into things. [...] Instead, I get this all-Ben extravaganza: combat, riding horses, foreign languages. And piano playing! [...] All waaaay outside my comfort zone. [...] How can you work two weeks and feel like you need a vacation already?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Superjesus {{on the eve of}} the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent {{provided}} the new name. Berryman explained, [...] "It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the '90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there's just heaps of Jesus' out there in the music world so we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have that and super was kind of like a '90s catch word."

2500|$|The show debuted {{on seven}} stations, {{but on the}} back of Kasem's [...] "always {{friendly}} and upbeat" [...] baritone voice it soon went nationwide. [...] In October 1978, the show expanded from three hours a week to four.

[...] "When we first went on the air, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be around for at least 20 years," [...] he later remarked. [...] "I knew the formula worked. I knew people tuned in {{to find out what the}} No. 1 record was." [...] Due to his great knowledge of music, Kasem became known as not just a disc jockey, but also a music historian.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers {{embarked}} on a world tour, {{which was the first}} time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986.

Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie." [...] The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006.

2500|$|Adele {{had said}} that she began writing it on her {{acoustic}} guitar {{in the wake of}} the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. I was waiting for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman {{does not have a}} main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E
