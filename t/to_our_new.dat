2500|$|The Wu Shu and Kuaiji Dianlu {{recorded}} {{an incident}} involving Sun Hao (孫暠), {{a cousin of}} Sun Ce. Sun Hao held the appointment of General of the Household Who Establishes Martial Might (定武中郎將) and was stationed at Wucheng County (烏程縣; in present-day Huzhou, Zhejiang). After Sun Ce died and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan, Sun Hao rallied his subordinates, formed an army, and prepared to attack Kuaiji Commandery. When Yu Fan heard about it, he ordered the people in Kuaiji to guard the commandery and await orders from their new lord (Sun Quan) while he met Sun Hao personally. He warned Sun Hao, [...] "Our former lord had passed away. Sun Quan is now our new lord. I'm prepared to lead everyone in Kuaiji to defend the commandery and eliminate any threat <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> lord. You better reconsider this." [...] Sun Hao retreated.|$|E
2500|$|André Weil's Weil conjectures {{stated that}} there was a cohomology theory for {{algebraic}} varieties over finite fields that would give an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. [...] The cohomology of a complex manifold can be defined as the sheaf cohomology of the locally constant sheaf [...] in the Euclidean topology, which suggests defining a Weil cohomology theory in positive characteristic as the sheaf cohomology of a constant sheaf. [...] But the only classical topology on such a variety is the Zariski topology, and the Zariski topology has very few open sets, so few that the cohomology of any Zariski-constant sheaf on an irreducible variety vanishes (except in degree zero). [...] Alexandre Grothendieck solved this problem by introducing Grothendieck topologies, which axiomatize the notion of covering. [...] Grothendieck's insight was that the definition of a sheaf depends only on the open sets of a topological space, not on the individual points. [...] Once he had axiomatized the notion of covering, open sets could be replaced by other objects. [...] A presheaf takes each one of these objects to data, just as before, and a sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the gluing axiom with respect <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> notion of covering. [...] This allowed Grothendieck to define étale cohomology and l-adic cohomology, which eventually were used to prove the Weil conjectures.|$|E
