Here a coal extract was prepared under heat and hydrogen pressure using finely pulverized coal and recycle donor solvent. As the coal molecule is broken down, free radicals are formed which are immediately stabilized by absorption of H atoms from the donor solvent. Extract then passes to a catalytic ebullated-bed hydrocracker (H-Oil unit) fed by additional hydrogen, forming lower molecular weight hydrocarbons and splitting off sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen originally present in the coal. Part of the liquid product is hydrogenated donor solvent which is returned to Stage I. The balance of liquid product is fractionated by distillation yielding various boiling range products and an ashy residue. Ashy residue goes to a Kerr-McGee CSDA unit which yields additional liquid product and a high-ash material containing unreacted coal and heavy residuum, which in a commercial plant would be gasified to make the H2 needed to feed the process. Parameters can be adjusted to avoid directly gasifying any of the coal entering the plant. Alternative versions of the plant configuration could use L-C Fining and/or an antisolvent deashing unit.

40|$|A new {{reaction}} of para-benzyne diradicals with anionic nucleophiles {{is different from}} their usual homolytic atom abstraction. Our studies show cyclodeca- 1, 5 -diyn- 3 -ene undergoing rate-limiting cycloaromatization to a para- benzyne, which rapidly adds nucleophiles to produce an aryl anion, which is then quenched by solvent or water to form 1 -(Nu) <b>tetrahydronaphthalenes.</b> Our results represent the first example of anionic nucleophiles, other than halides, reacting towards a para-aryne. Our reactivity scale reflects the ease of Nu- desolvation, with the smaller, more highly solvated ions being slower in their reaction towards the para-benzyne diradical. Experimental results are in good agreement with computational data, and these suggest Nu- additions to para-benzyne to be governed by solvation other than basic strength or nucleophilic character. Deuterium can be incorporated from aryl anion reacting with such weak acids as water, DMSO or CH₃CN. The question addressed here is the relative reactivity of these two solvents and water, which can be measured by competition experiments {{with a mixture of}} labeled and non- labeled solvent. The relative reactivities kH₂O/kSolvent-d, kD₂O/kSolvent, and kSolvent/kSolvent-d were measured, and these values were combined to evaluate other relative reactivities including some which could not be measured directly, because {{there is no way to}} determine the source of the H or D in product. The low selectivity for CH₃CN over DMSO, despite a difference in acidities of nearly 10 ⁴ -fold, is evidence for high basicity of the aryl anion. Moreover, the observation that the same relative reactivities are obtained with Bu₄NI as with LiI is evidence that the aryl anion reacts more rapidly than the Li⁺ can reach the para carbon to form an aryllithium.

40|$|The Diels-Alder {{reaction}} {{is a very}} useful tool for the art and science of total synthesis. This thesis describes the exploitation of this reaction {{in the context of}} the synthesis of two different natural products, a diterpene and a steroid. A new approach to the total synthesis of vinigrol relied on an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction to generate two of three rings of the carbocyclic skeleton in one step. Initially, it was possible to prove that the intramolecular cycloaddition could effectively form the desired six and eight-membered ring with the right regiochemistry. Then, the starting materials were modified in order to accommodate the necessary functionality needed for the total synthesis. As a result, a functionalized tricyclic core of vinigrol was synthesized. A second-generation synthesis of a functionalized core was established taking advantage of a diastereoselective ketal Claisen rearrangement. The functionalization of the C 8 -C 8 a was studied as well as the synthesis of the allylic diol of the B ring. The Diels-Alder reaction was also examined in the context of domino reactions. Optimization of the oxy-Cope/Claisen/ene/hydroxy-directed Diels-Alder reaction was achieved. It was also possible to study this reaction in order to accommodate cis precursors and apply it to the synthesis of digitoxigenin, a 14 beta-hydroxy steroid. Many approaches were investigated to synthesize a functionalized cis precursor designed for the total synthesis. The rearrangement of a functionalized cis-precursor is also discussed.

The similarity of the results demonstrates the repeatability of thermodiffusion experiments in a microgravity environment. There was nearly equal separation of the <b>tetrahydronaphthalene</b> and isobutylbenzene components in opposite directions, while dodecane experienced a weak separation {{in the same direction as}} isobutylbenzene. Finally, Fourier image processing and calculations of the transient separation of the components were used to analyze the heat transfer in the system and to measure the Soret coefficients for this ternary mixture. The successful measurements shown in this work can serve as the standard for ground experiments and for numerical modeling of hydrocarbon mixtures. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

The title compound, C 17 H 13 ClO 6, is an {{asymmetric}} alicyclic dianhydride {{containing a}} chloromethyl-substituted tetra-hydronaphthalene moiety. The cyclohexene {{ring in the}} <b>tetrahydronaphthalene</b> moiety exhibits an envelope confor-mation with the tertiary C atom as the flap The dihedral angle between the two anhydride rings is 79. 96 (6), while those between the benzene ring and the non-fused and fused anhydride rings are 71. 03 (5) and 42. 57 (7), respectively. In the crystal, molecules are connected by weak C—H O interactions, forming a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Related literature For background to polyimides, see: Li et al.

40|$|Three solvent systems, {{chlorobenzene}} (ink 1), chlorobenzene/o-dichlorobenzene (ink 2) and chlorobenzene/ <b>tetrahydronaphthalene</b> (ink 3), {{were compared}} as printable inks for the fabrication of polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) using poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 -ethylhexyl-oxyl) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene (MEH-PPV) as an emissive material and an inkjet printer (Fujifilm Dimatix DMP- 2831). Ink 1 clogged the printer’s nozzle and gave non-uniform film. Inks 2 and 3 {{were used to}} fabricate PLEDs with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV/LiF/Al configurations. The best performance (turn-on voltage, 3. 5 V; luminance efficiency, 0. 17 cd/A; luminance, 1, 800 cd/m) was obtained when ink 3 was used to form the emissive layer (thickness, 49 nm), attributable to the better morphology and suitable thickness of the MEH-PPV layer...|$|E
