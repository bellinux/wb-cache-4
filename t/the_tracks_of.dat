5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{ordered a}} total of 150 SDP40Fs, in two batches. The first order, placed on November 2, 1972, was for 40 {{locomotives}}, {{at a cost of}} $18 million. A second order, for 110 locomotives at $50 million, followed on October 12, 1973. These orders were Amtrak's first for new-build locomotives. Amtrak deployed the original 40 locomotives on long-distance trains in the Western United States. The first locomotives entered revenue service on June 22, 1973, hauling the Super Chief from Chicago to Los Angeles over <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. SDP40Fs were also used on the Burlington Northern Railroad. The arrival of the second order enabled Amtrak to deploy the SDP40Fs throughout the country, displacing the inherited E-units.|$|E

According to the {{principle}} producing <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, to study the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter on <b>the</b> process of high speed ball-end milling, the single-factor models for evaluating <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter are established. Adopting four kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, <b>the</b> experiment of high speed ball-end milling is processed. The model of multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter is established, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter is accomplished by the application of fuzzy mathematics theory. Results show that the cutting contact curve of cutter affects directly the process of high speed ball-end milling, fuzzy and uncertain properties exist in the evaluation for <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter. <b>The</b> optimum cutting <b>track</b> can be selected by multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for <b>the</b> cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter...|$|R

5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E

5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, no service needs to cross over <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> another service. The tracks are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> {{this station}} {{continue}} {{south of the}} station, down to 25th Street, to allow trains to be stored south of the station during off-peak hours; the tail tracks are seven blocks long, enough to store two 11-car trains each, since the delivery of the R188 train cars was to add 66 more cars to the fleet of the 7 service. There are also two diamond crossovers, one north and one south of the station. The storage tracks at this location were constructed due to the Corona Yard in Queens lacking any space to hold any more trains, and expanding the yard is very difficult due to its location next to the Flushing River. A new storage yard elsewhere would be prohibitively expensive, as it would cost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars.|$|E
5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a little girl in similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E

5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|Covert coordinated efforts {{between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese Armed Forces had started in 1967, {{and soon after}} Cauldron ended, the RLI was {{involved}} in a joint operation in Mozambique. A group of 17 Lusaka-based nationalists infiltrated Mozambique's north-western Tete Province, between Rhodesia and Malawi, in April 1968. Their presence was reported to Portuguese authorities on 20 May by local tribesmen from Catumbula, a small village just north of the Mazoe River, which in that area ran along the border with Rhodesia. A Portuguese patrol contacted and scattered the guerrillas the next day. The nationalist fighters, split into two groups, then moved towards Rhodesia, one team heading south-west and the other south. Acting on information given by the Portuguese, the Rhodesians started Operation Flotilla, based at the border town of Nyamapanda, on 23 May. 1 Commando, RLI was sent out on patrol the same day under Major Peter Rich. However, no trace of the insurgents was reported by Rich's men, apart from <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> six men on the northern (Mozambican) side of the Mazoe River. The cadres had not actually left Mozambique; a counter-insurgency effort by the Portuguese military and police resulted in most of them being captured or killed. Six who did eventually cross into Rhodesia in early June were captured by the BSAP.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the night}} of 2/3 April 1946, there were several attacks on railway {{installations}} around the country. One at Yibna occurred {{at the same time}} as a patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion was entering the village. The patrol's leading two vehicles exploded mines that had been laid on a bridge, wounding three men. At daylight <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> around 30 men were found, and a section from the 8th Parachute Battalion eventually cornered 24 armed men. In the firefight that followed, 14 of them were wounded and the remainder surrendered, with no British casualties. On 29 June Operation Agatha started; the brigade had been rotated to cover the south of Palestine, and were to search for arms and arrest any members of the Palmach in Givat Brenner and No'ar Oved. On 22 July the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed, which was the catalyst for Operation Shark, the searching of every house and property in Tel Aviv. For this operation the brigade had all the divisional artillery and the 3rd The King's Own Hussars under their command. The brigade's next tasks were Operations Bream and Eel between 28 August and 4 September, which entailed the search of Dorot and Ruhama in the Negev. For the first time army dogs trained in metal detecting were used during the operations, and they located a large arms cache in both settlements.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of modern {{tropical}} cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location {{in relation to the}} storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the eleven known storms in the 1906 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández-Partagás's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partagás also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E
