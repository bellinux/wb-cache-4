5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (89.6%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%) and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia.

After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during {{the last part of}} and after World War II, and a similar fate was suffered by the Italian population. The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen {{that causes the}} disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

30|$|In conclusion, the {{substrate}} temperature and the pulse laser energy affect <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdS nanoneedles, but the influenced factors are interacted. <b>The</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molten catalyst spheres is confirmed {{to be the}} key to <b>the</b> nucleation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdS nanoneedles by observing <b>the</b> morphologies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ni-catalyst thin films annealed at different substrate temperatures. Under the certain conditions, changing {{the substrate}} temperature or the pulse laser energy may cause <b>the</b> changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdS nanoneedles. In our experiments, under the same laser energy, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdS nanoneedles is VS at a substrate temperature of 400 °C, but it turns into VLS at a substrate temperature of 450 °C. Also, altering the pulse laser energy from 50 to 80  mJ may also change <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdS nanoneedles from VLS to VS. Besides, <b>the</b> secondary <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller CdS nanoneedles is found on <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main CdS nanoneedles.
