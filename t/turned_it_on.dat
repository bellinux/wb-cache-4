5|$|On May 28, 2009, the MTA {{awarded a}} $325 million {{contract}} to E.E. Cruz and Tully Construction Co., {{a joint venture}} and limited liability company, to construct the 96th Street station box. Work on this contract began in July. In June 2009, {{the first of three}} contracts for the 86th Street station was awarded for the advance utility relocation work and construction of cut-and-cover shaft areas at 83rd and 86th Streets. After a delay in delivering the TBMs, the MTA's contractors completed the TBM installation on May 14, 2010, and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> at the Second Avenue Subway launch box at 96th Street, boring southward to connecting shafts built at 86th and 72nd Streets. On October 1, 2010, MTA awarded a $431 million contract to joint venture SSK Constructors for the mining of the tunnels connecting the 72nd Street station to the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, and for the excavation and heavy civil structures of the 72nd Street station. A subsequent contract was awarded to Skanska Traylor Joint Venture for excavation of the cavern at the 86th Street station on August 4, 2011. In January 2011, MTA awarded Judlau Contracting a 40-month, $176.4 million contract to rebuild and enlarge the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} North Koreans {{launched}} a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. The North Koreans captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E

50|$|It seems {{impossible}} {{to answer this}} question. <b>It</b> cannot be <b>on,</b> because I did not ever <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> without at once <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> off.

25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> to make a personal point with Ackerman.

2500|$|Minstrelsy's {{reaction}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is indicative of}} plantation content at the time. Tom acts largely came to replace other plantation narratives, particularly in the third act. These sketches sometimes supported Stowe's novel, but just as often they <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> its head or attacked the author. Whatever the intended message, it was usually lost in the joyous, slapstick atmosphere of the piece. Characters such as Simon Legree sometimes disappeared, and the title was frequently changed to something more cheerful like [...] "Happy Uncle Tom" [...] or [...] "Uncle Dad's Cabin". Uncle Tom himself was frequently portrayed as a harmless bootlicker to be ridiculed. Troupes known as Tommer companies specialized in such burlesques, and theatrical Tom shows integrated elements of the minstrel show and competed with it for a time.|$|E

Hodge read it and made it his goal to [...] "produce a screenplay which would seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end, would last 90 minutes and would convey {{at least some of the}} spirit and the content of the book". Boyle convinced Welsh to let them option the rights to his book by writing him a letter stating that Hodge and Macdonald were [...] "the two most important Scotsmen since Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson". Welsh remembered that originally the people wanting to option his book [...] "wanted to make a po-faced piece of social realism like Christiane F or The Basketball Diaries". He was impressed that Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald wanted everyone to see the film and [...] "not just the arthouse audience". In October 1994, Hodge, Boyle and Macdonald spent a lot of time discussing which chapters of the book would and would not translate into film. Hodge finished the first draft by December.
