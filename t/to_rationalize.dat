IGN has noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue {{as one of the}} most famous video game glitches. Fans of the series have attempted <b>to</b> <b>rationalize</b> MissingNo. as part of the games' canon, and sociologists have studied its impact on players.|$|E

5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura <b>to</b> <b>rationalize</b> experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E

By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the costs would be reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means <b>to</b> <b>rationalize</b> costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo.

It details three areas in which the notion of a normative commitment is made central. These are (1) believing and intending, (2) practices conceived as essentially rule-governed activities, and (3) meaning and concepts. An account is given of how we may best explain the commitments incurred by beliefs and intentions. It is held that those states are themselves essentially normative. A problem of the relevance of <b>rationalizing</b> <b>to</b> <b>rationalizing</b> explanation is explored and the relation between normative commitments and normative reasons is discussed...|$|R
