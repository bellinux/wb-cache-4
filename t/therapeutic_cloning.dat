25|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>cloning</b> is {{achieved}} by creating embryonic stem cells {{in the hopes of}} treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.|$|E
40|$|The final thesis "Human Cloning and Value of Humanity in the View of Theological Ethics and Ethic of Responsibility" {{discusses}} the ethical context of human cloning. It {{pertains to the}} issue of the moral legitimacy of reproductive and <b>therapeutic</b> human <b>cloning.</b> Both these methods are connected to the utilization of human embryos. Are men authorized to manipulate human embryos in this way and is it a responsible action in the long term? This thesis aims to answer these questions including respect for the dignity of human life and its preservation. The thesis presents important inventions for biomedicine, and in this context tries to gain a glimpse of an image of contemporary man, interprets relevant legislation and discussion on the status of the embryo. The basis of theological ethics is the base of an ethical thinking which is emphasized by the assumption of responsibility for the life of future generations.

2500|$|In January 2008, Dr. Andrew French and Samuel Wood of the {{biotechnology}} company Stemagen {{announced that}} they successfully created the first five mature human embryos using SCNT. In this case, each embryo was created by taking a nucleus from a skin cell (donated by Wood and a colleague) and inserting it into a human egg from which the nucleus had been removed. The embryos were developed only to the blastocyst stage, at which point they were studied in processes that destroyed them.

25|$|In 1998, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009, the US Congress voted {{whether to}} ban all human cloning, both {{reproductive}} and therapeutic (see Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act). Each time, {{divisions in the}} Senate, or an eventual veto from the sitting President (President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2007), over <b>therapeutic</b> <b>cloning</b> prevented either competing proposal (a ban on both forms or on reproductive cloning only) from being passed into law. On March 10, 2010 a bill (HR 4808) was introduced with a section banning federal funding for human cloning. Such a law, if passed, would not have prevented research from occurring in private institutions (such as universities) that have both private and federal funding.

25|$|Some life extensionists {{suggest that}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>cloning</b> and stem cell {{research}} could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, {{have not yet been}} replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections.

Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>cloning</b> {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{discussions about}} the nature and value of personhood, of metaphysical and {{normative}} aspects of becoming a person and ceasing to be one, having been conducted {{at the very center of}} the debates on abortion, <b>therapeutic</b> human <b>cloning,</b> embryo experimentation, and so on, for decades have proven notoriously difficult and their insights disappointingly inconclusive. In the paper I would like to turn our attention to the other end of the life span and explore the moral implications of acknowledging to, or witholding from, someone the status of a person, i. e. a rational being, for the choice between prolonging her life and facilitating her death. The philosophical challenge facing the opponent of euthanasia can then be put as follows: suppose the patient's decision to have her life terminated is both voluntary and prudent; further suppose that neither her decision nor the carrying out of it by a health professional violates anyone's rights or fails to discharge anyone's duties. What else could possibly make the doctor's compliance with the patient's request wrong and what other moral objections could possibly be raised against the proposal to provide a legal protection for such an option for the terminally-ill patients...|$|R
2500|$|In {{genetics}} and developmental biology, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory strategy {{for creating a}} viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell.

40|$|Abstract: Domain III of the dengue virus {{envelope}} protein (EDIII, aa 295 - 395) has an immunoglobulin fold {{and is the}} proposed receptor-binding domain of the virus. Previous {{studies have shown that}} monoclonal antibodies against EDIII can be neutralizing and have <b>therapeutic</b> potential. Here, <b>cloned</b> Fab-phage libraries of human and mouse origin were screened for DENV specific antibodies. Firstly, bacterially expressed EDIII or whole virus particles were used as bait in biopanning against a large naïve human Fab-phage library (> 10 billion independent clones). Multiple panning strategies were employed, and in excess of 1000 clones were screened, but all of the antibodies identified bound the envelope in regions outside EDIII suggesting EDIII antibodies are virtually absent from the naïve human repertoire. Next, a chimeric Fab-phage library was constructed from a panel of EDIII specific mouse hybridomas by pooling the VH and VL chain sequences from the hybridomas and cloning these into the pComb 3 X phagemid vector with human CH and CL encoding sequences. Biopanning against EDIII identified a unique antibody (C 9) that cross-reacts with EDIII from DENV 1 - 3 and, in the IgG format, binds and neutralizes DENV 2 in cell-based assays.

40|$|BACKGROUND Defective interfering (DI) viruses {{are natural}} antivirals made by nearly all viruses. They have a highly deleted genome (thus being non-infectious) and {{interfere}} with the replication of genetically related infectious viruses. We have produced the first potential therapeutic DI virus for the clinic by cloning an influenza A DI RNA (1 / 244) which was derived naturally from genome segment 1. This is highly effective in vivo, and has unexpectedly broad-spectrum activity with two different modes of action: inhibiting influenza A viruses through RNA interference, and all other (interferon-sensitive) respiratory viruses through stimulating interferon type I. RESULTS We have investigated the RNA inhibitory mechanism(s) of DI 1 / 244 RNA. Ablation of initiation codons does not diminish interference showing that no protein product is required for protection. Further analysis indicated that 1 / 244 DI RNA interferes by replacing the cognate full-length segment 1 RNA in progeny virions, while interfering with the expression of genome segment 1, its cognate RNA, and genome RNAs 2 and 3, but not genome RNA 6, {{a representative of the}} non-polymerase genes.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a biocentric, consequentialist, {{cosmopolitan}} ethical theory is advanced {{as the best}} way of enhancing quality of life for those entities that possess moral standing and are morally considerable. It is maintained that quality of life revolves around the development and exercise of essential capacities. A notion of interests is used here which goes beyond consciousness and sentience to refer to the development and exercise of species-related essential capacities. Essential capacities are those facets of a species that enable it to flourish, that is, to lead a life worth living for that particular species. Any entity capable of flourishing is argued to have intrinsic value and will therefore be morally considerable. Clearly not all entities can have the same degree of moral standing the moral significance, or 'weight', of an entity depends on its capacity to bear intrinsic value more sophisticated essential capacities will denote greater capability for mtrinsic value. Various criticisms of consequentialism are considered and challenged. A normative theory of practice-consequentialism is advocated to address specific medical issues, including <b>therapeutic</b> and reproductive <b>cloning.</b> Related bioethical issues are also briefly examined, such as embryo research, 'designer' babies and xenotransplantation. Finally, the concept of sustainable development is discussed.
