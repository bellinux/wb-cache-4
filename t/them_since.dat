5|$|The Canadiens {{have won}} the Stanley Cup more times than any other franchise. They have won 24 Stanley Cups, 23 of <b>them</b> <b>since</b> the {{founding}} of the NHL and 22 of <b>them</b> <b>since</b> 1927, when NHL teams became the only ones to compete for the Stanley Cup. On a percentage basis, as of 2014, the franchise has won 25.3% of all Stanley Cup championships contested after the Challenge Cup era, making it the second most successful professional sports team of the traditional four major sports of Canada and the United States, behind only the Boston Celtics.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed <b>them.</b> <b>Since</b> the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided <b>them.</b> <b>Since</b> the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in <b>them</b> <b>since</b> hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E
5|$|King's Cross is spelled {{both with}} and without an apostrophe. King's Cross is used in signage at the Network Rail and London Underground stations, on the Tube map and on the {{official}} Network Rail webpage. It rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on <b>them</b> <b>since</b> 1951. Kings X, Kings + and London KX are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail station code is KGX.|$|E

5|$|Operation Winter'94 became {{feasible}} {{after the}} HVO captured Kupres (north of the Livanjsko field) in Operation Cincar on 3 November 1994, securing the right {{flank of the}} planned advance northwest of Livno. The HVO and the ARBiH advanced towards Kupres, in the first military effort coordinated between <b>them</b> <b>since</b> the Washington Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{have played}} seven {{of their home}} matches at Easter Road, all of <b>them</b> <b>since</b> 1998. The most recent {{international}} match played at the ground was a friendly between Scotland and Canada in March 2017. The ground has hosted one international not involving Scotland, a friendly played between Ghana and South Korea preceding the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Easter Road has also sometimes {{been used as a}} neutral venue for Scottish League Cup semi-final matches and once hosted a Scottish Challenge Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, the Knights of Columbus {{has been}} {{involved}} in evangelization. In 1948, the Knights started the Catholic Information Service (CIS) to provide low-cost Catholic publications for the general public as well as for parishes, schools, retreat houses, military installations, correctional facilities, legislatures, the medical community, and for individuals who request <b>them.</b> <b>Since</b> then, CIS has printed millions of booklets, and thousands of people have enrolled in CIS correspondence and on-line courses.|$|E

5|$|Whitaker {{plays an}} active role as {{co-chair}} of JuntoBox Films since his initial involvement as co-chair with the collaborative film studio starting in March 2012. JuntoBox was developed as a social-media platform for filmmakers and fans to share ideas to create films and then collaborate to make <b>them.</b> <b>Since</b> Whitaker joined as co-chair, five projects have been greenlit for production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching <b>them</b> <b>since</b> the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E
5|$|In 1515, Pope Leo X {{granted a}} plenary indulgence {{intended}} {{to finance the}} construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It would apply to almost any sin, including adultery and theft. All other indulgence preaching was to cease for the eight years {{in which it was}} offered. Indulgence preachers were given strict instructions on how the indulgence was to be preached, and they were much more laudatory of the indulgence than those of earlier indulgences. Johann Tetzel was commissioned to preach and offer the indulgence in 1517, and his campaign in cities near Wittenberg drew many Wittenbergers to travel to these cities and purchase <b>them,</b> <b>since</b> sales had been prohibited in Wittenberg and other Saxon cities.|$|E

5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against <b>them.</b> <b>Since</b> these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, {{the income}} from the {{navigation}} had dropped, {{as a result of}} attempts to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain <b>them,</b> <b>since</b> they did not generate any revenue. Nor could they be closed, since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from a knee injury in the build-up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Morgan made her first start at the World Cup Finals as the US defeated Nigeria 1–0 in the last group match to advance as group winners. She registered her only goal of the World Cup's knockout stage with the opener in the 2–0 last 16 win over Colombia. Morgan did, however, win penalties for the USWNT in the 2–0 victories against Colombia in the last 16 and Germany in the semi-finals, respectively. Morgan then started the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final as the USWNT defeated Japan 5–2 to win its third FIFA Women's World Cup. Morgan played in all seven World Cup Finals matches and started {{in every one of}} <b>them</b> <b>since</b> being restored to the starting XI against Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service <b>them</b> <b>since</b> an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded <b>them</b> <b>since</b> they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|Several Michigan {{school records}} were broken or tied in the blowout win. The Wolverines' 727 yards of total offense {{set a new}} team record; the 442 total {{offensive}} yards {{in the first half}} alone also set a team record. Their 57-point win tied the second-biggest margin of victory for <b>them</b> <b>since</b> 1950, and tied for the eighth-largest margin of victory in school history. The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record. Because of the effectiveness of the offense, the team did not punt the ball once, the first time this has happened since 1978.|$|E
