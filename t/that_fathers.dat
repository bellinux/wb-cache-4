25|$|In Japan, {{according}} to 2004 data from National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, mothers receive custody in roughly 80 percent of divorces involving children. This is {{a shift from}} 1970 which awarded custody to mothers only in 50 percent of cases. Similarly, in the U.S. one source estimates <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> received sole or joint custody 26 {{percent of the time}} while mothers or someone other than the father received sole custody 74 percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{describes}} no-fault or unilateral divorce {{based on}} no fault {{as a power}} grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> have {{a constitutional right to}} shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{is not as}} {{workplace}} family-oriented as {{many other}} wealthy countries. According to a study released by Harvard and McGill University researchers in February 2007, workplace policies for families in the U.S. are weaker than those of all high-income countries and even many middle-and low-income countries. Other differences include the fact <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> are granted paid paternity leave or paid parental leave in sixty-five countries; thirty one of these countries offer at least fourteen weeks of paid leave. The U.S. does not guarantee this to fathers.(survey) Sweden, Denmark and Norway have {{the highest level of}} maternity benefits—Sweden provides 68 weeks paid maternity leave, Norway provides 56 weeks paid maternity leave and Denmark provides 52.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties {{on how to}} start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E
25|$|When in Ateneo Larramendi {{embarked}} on Catholic propaganda, trying {{to confront the}} growing secularization tide. In 1906 he addressed Cortes with legal note, aimed against the plan to introduce civil marriages; in 1910 he published Cómo defendernos de las escuelas laicas, a booklet aimed against the concept of public, secular, free and obligatory school, launched by the republican groupings; Larramendi claimed <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> {{had the right to}} bring up their children the way they wanted. Campaigning against secular education carried him as far as to Andalusia, though his principal battleground were various public fora of the capital; apart from the Ateneo he spoke also in theatres and apart from education discussed also Catholic syndicalism and episodes of public blasphemy, soon growing to president of the Madrid branch of Juventud Jaimista.|$|E

500|$|Additional {{studies show}} that during {{the first five years}} of a child's life, the father's role is more {{influential}} than the mother's in how the child learns to manage his or her body, navigate social circumstances, and play. Furthermore, a 1996 study by McGill University found that the [...] "single most important childhood factor in developing empathy is paternal involvement in childcare". [...] Children that have a strong paternal influence have more nurturing abilities. [...] It has been researched in The Role of the Father in Child Development, that in general, children with stay-at-home dads develop attachments at infancy. The study further concluded <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> who spent time alone bonding with their children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate adults.|$|E

On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

60|$|The Earl, however, {{could hardly}} have taken {{anything}} amiss from Louis. After having {{for so many years}} withheld all the lassez-aller of paternal affection, when the right chord had once been touched, his fondness for his grown-up son had the fresh exulting pride, and almost blindness that would ordinarily have been lavished on his infancy. Lord Ormersfield's sentiments were few and slowly adopted, but they had all the permanence and force of his strong character, and his affection for Fitzjocelyn partook both of parental glory in a promising only son, and of that tenderness, at once protecting and dependent, <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> feel for daughters. This was owing partly to Louis's gentle and assiduous attentions during the last vacation, and also to his long illness, and remarkable resemblance to his mother, which rendered fondness of him a sort of tribute to her, and restored to the Earl some of the transient happiness of his life.|$|E
