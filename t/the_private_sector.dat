40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{strategies}} for enhancing <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> participation in <b>the</b> funding of secondary schools in Delta State, Nigeria. Three research questions were reviewed and two hypotheses were tested. Data were collected through the use of structured questionnaire. The statistic method used for the analysis is the t-test method. The results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> recognize <b>the</b> educational enterprise as an expensive social service. The study finds that the abhorrent policies of the government towards <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> prevent them from funding secondary schools. It is recommended that policies be devised by the State government to encourage the participation of <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> in <b>the</b> funding of secondary schools and that <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> should be more involved in the promotion of education by contributing towards the renovation of school buildings; and, the provision of instructional materials...|$|R

5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959).

This apparent revival of <b>the</b> <b>private</b> rental <b>sector</b> is often enhanced by government interventions, such as rent deregulation and the provision of subsidies and fiscal concessions.

5|$|The case of Greece {{shows that}} {{excessive}} levels of private indebtedness and {{a collapse of}} public confidence (over 90% of Greeks fear unemployment, poverty and the closure of businesses) led <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> to decrease spending {{in an attempt to}} save up for rainy days ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} role of <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> {{forms an}} important {{trend in the}} ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> to improve the efficiency {{with which they were}} provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{the issue}} of {{transparency}} is important {{not just for the}} WTO and the adherence to its rules by member countries but also for <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> and trading communities of both countries. It is expected that WTO would bring benefits for <b>the</b> Ethiopian <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> It is argued that WTO accession or subscription to more transparent trade regimes beyond preferential treatment will change the rules of doing business in Ethiopia by strengthening the forces of the market. The argument is that competition will gradually increase, creating opportunities for <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors.</b> According to <b>the</b> World Bank’s Doing Business indicators, Ethiopia is believed to be not doing well as <b>the</b> role of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in international trade is limited (Ibid). More importantly the challenges of transparency and the availability of information do affect not only member states of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, but also the domestic actors who in fact are the engine of international trade.|$|R

5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry.

5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education.

The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

50|$|Primary {{method of}} {{privatization}} in Croatia was management employee buyouts, while the secondary method used was voucher privatization. In 1991 <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector's</b> share of GDP was 25 percent, and {{its share of}} employed workforce was 22 percent. The method of privatization contributed to the increase of state ownership because unsold shares were transferred to state funds. In 1999 <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector's</b> share in GDP reached 60 percent, which was significantly lower compared to other former socialist countries.
