5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century.

5|$|The broad {{variety of}} work {{produced}} using a semi-mechanized process with many collaborators, Warhol's popularity, {{the value of}} his works, and the diversity of works across various media and genre have created a need for the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board to certify <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> of works by Warhol.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that}} the two {{separate}} addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish <b>the</b> <b>authenticity</b> of evidence.|$|E

5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death.

While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>authenticity</b> of {{the casket}} letters {{has been the}} source of much {{controversy}} among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way.

There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
