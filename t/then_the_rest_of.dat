5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|The 1850s was {{a period}} of {{transition}} for the ice trade. The industry was already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was invested in the industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage at any one time in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade shifted away from relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the rapidly expanding country.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E

With the space battle ongoing, the transporter system is damaged so that only two personnel can beam out at one time. Hayes sends one of his men and Sato out first, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the team. Hayes, now alone, is forced to retreat and just as he is beaming out, a Reptilian soldier fires through his chest. Back on board Enterprise, he collapses on the transporter platform, and soon dies of heart-failure in Sickbay.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Tyre, on 27 July the crusaders {{decided to}} move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily {{fortified}} but had much less food and water. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them.|$|E

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He {{decided to do}} so only at 09:00, {{when it became clear}} that the other two companies were at a safe distance, and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After they came to a small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Oksywie culture, {{so named}} after a village (now within the city of Gdynia) where a burial site was found, lasted from 250 BC to 30 AD and {{originally}} occupied the Vistula delta region, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> eastern Pomerania, expanded west up to the Jastorf Oder group area, in the 1st century BC also including partially what was before that group's territory. It had basically, like other cultures of this period, La Tène cultural characteristics, with traits typical of the Baltic cultures. Oksywie culture's ceramics and burial customs indicate strong ties with the Przeworsk culture. Men only had their ashes placed in well made black urns with fine finish and a decorative band around. Their graves were supplied (unlike those of the Jastorf culture) with utensils and weapons, including typical for this culture swords with one-sided edge, and were often covered or marked by stones. Women's ashes were buried in hollows and supplied with feminine items. A clay vessel with relief animal images found in Gołębiowo Wielkie in Gdańsk County (2nd half of the 1st century BC) is among the finest {{in all of the}} Germanic cultural zone.|$|E
