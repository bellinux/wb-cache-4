50|$|Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a data {{analysis}} technique for examining {{the significance of}} the factors (independent variables) in a multi-factor model. The one factor model {{can be thought of as}} a generalization of the <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test.</b> That is, the <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test</b> is a test of the hypothesis that two population means are equal. The one factor ANOVA tests the hypothesis that k population means are equal. The standard ANOVA assumes that the errors (i.e., residuals) are normally distributed. If this normality assumption is not valid, an alternative is to use a non-parametric test.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{abnormal}} DNA methylation in {{the progression of}} disease is a growing area of research that relies upon the establishment of sound statistical methods. The common method for declaring there is differential methylation between two groups at a given CpG site, as summarized by the difference between proportions methylated db=b 1 -b 2, has been through use of a Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test,</b> using the recommended filter of 0. 17 (Bibikova et al., 2006 b). In this dissertation, we performed a re-analysis of the data used in recommending the threshold by fitting a mixed-effects ANOVA model. It was determined that the 0. 17 filter is not accurate and conjectured that application of a Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> likely leads to loss of power. Further, the <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> assumes that data arise from an underlying distribution encompassing the entire real number line, whereas b 1 and b 2 are constrained on the interval. Additionally, {{the imposition of a}} filter at a level signifying the minimum level of detectable difference to a <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> likely reduces power for smaller but truly differentially methylated CpG sites. Therefore, we compared the <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> and the Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test,</b> which are widely used but largely untested with respect to their performance, to three proposed methods. These three proposed methods are a Beta distribution test, a Likelihood ratio test, and a Bootstrap test, where each was designed to address distributional concerns present in the current testing methods. It was ultimately shown through simulations comparing Type I and Type II error rates that the (unfiltered) <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> and the Beta distribution test performed comparatively well...|$|E

Methods: Fifty one patients were prospectively recruited to undergo BS implantation following failed DS and 51 patients underwent repeat DS, for which data was collected retrospectively. All eyes {{had at least one}} failed DS. Surgical success was defined as IOP≤ 21 mmHg and 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline. Success rates, number of glaucoma medications (GMs), IOP, and complication rates were compared between the two groups at year 1, post-operatively. Results: Mean age, sex and the proportion of glaucoma subtypes were similar between groups. Preoperatively IOP was significantly lower in DS group vs BS group (18. 8 mmHg vs 23. 8 mmHg, p< 0. 01, <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test).</b> Postoperatively IOP was significantly higher in DS group than BS group (14. 6 mmHg vs 12. 0 mmHg, p< 0. 01, two-sample t-test). In the DS group, 47 % of eyes did not achieve 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline, as a result the success rates were significantly lower in eyes with DS (51 %) than in eyes with BS (88 %) (p= 0. 02, log-rank test). Preoperatively the number of GMs used in DS and BS groups were similar (2. 2 vs 2. 7 p= 0. 02, <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test).</b> Postoperatively there remained no significant difference in GMs between groups (0. 9 vs 1. 1, p= 0. 58, <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test).</b> Complication rates were similar between the two groups (12 % vs 10 %).

40|$|Abstract Background The primary {{analysis}} in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial {{is sometimes a}} comparison of arms at a single time point. While a two-sample t-test is often used, missing data are common in longitudinal studies and decreases power by reducing sample size. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) can test treatment effects at specific time points, {{have been shown to}} give unbiased estimates in certain missing data contexts, and may be more powerful than a <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test.</b> Methods We conducted a simulation study to compare the performance of a complete-case t-test to a MMRM in terms of power and bias under different missing data mechanisms. Impact of within- and between-person variance, dropout mechanism, and variance-covariance structure were all considered. Results While both complete-case t-test and MMRM provided unbiased estimation of treatment differences when data were missing completely at random, MMRM yielded an absolute power gain of up to 12  %. The MMRM provided up to 25  % absolute increased power over the t-test when data were missing at random, as well as unbiased estimation. Conclusions Investigators interested in single time point comparisons should use a MMRM with a contrast to gain power and unbiased estimation of treatment effects instead of a complete-case <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> <b>t-test...</b>|$|E

Bulk milk was evaluated by performing standard plate count (SPC), preliminary incubation count (PIC), laboratory pasteurization count (LPC), coliform count (CC), somatic cell count (SCC) and detection of the contagious mastitis agents. The farms were divided into low and high SPC groups (below and above 100, 000 CFU/mL) based on Iranian standards. Comparisons of the laboratory results between groups were done using <b>two</b> independent <b>samples</b> <b>t-test.</b> The relationships between the laboratory results were studied by Pearson’s correlation coefficients, all after logarithmic transformation. Associations of managerial risk factors (obtained by the questionnaire and one time of observation) with laboratory results were investigated using <b>two</b> independent <b>samples</b> <b>t-test.</b> P-values 0. 05). Strong correlations were detected between SPC and PIC, SPC and CC, and PIC and CC, {{but many of the}} well explained risk factors of undesired milk quality lacked any relation with high bacterial counts of raw milk. This could be due to the small number of the studied farms, almost similar faults in the farms, wrong answers of the employees to the questions and modification of the milking practices in the presence of an inspector. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis could be potential problems in the studied farms, contributing to the elevation of SCC and/or SPC levels.
