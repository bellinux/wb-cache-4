G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the <b>tube</b> <b>diameter</b> and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} play {{significant role}} in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Ongoing research aims to improve, or at least maintain, the system performance while reducing the size, weight and cost of the heat exchangers. This in turn leads to lower system refrigerant charge and reduced environmental impact. Using heat exchangers with small <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> (less than 5 mm) instead of large <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> {{has been shown to}} be a promising solution to meet the aforementioned goals. However, shifting towards mall <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> requires in-depth analysis and optimization of several heat exchanger design parameters. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization of a residential air source heat pump system using genetic algorithms with a particular focus on the use of small <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> in the heat exchangers. The objectives are to minimize the heat exchangersâ€™ cost and maximize the system performance. The goal of this study is to determine the potential material savings and cost reduction when using <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> between 3 mm and 5 mm in the heat exchangers. In addition to the <b>tube</b> <b>diameters,</b> multiple fin types, tube spacing and fin densities are also investigated. The optimization is carried out for R- 410 A, and a lower-GWP alternative, R- 32. Â The system utilizing the improved heat exchanger designs has a cost reduction of 50 % in comparison to the baseline system. Also, the improvements in the systemâ€™s COP and the system charge reduction are around 20 % and 35 %, respectively. ...|$|R

This study showed that water undergoes distinct transitions in structure, dielectric properties, and mobility as the <b>tube</b> <b>diameter</b> is varied.

2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked driving axle, the <b>tube</b> <b>diameter</b> required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E
2500|$|The White-Forster was {{of simple}} construction, with tubes that {{had only a}} gentle {{curvature}} to them. This was sufficient {{to allow them to}} be replaced in-situ, working through the manhole {{at the end of the}} large steam drum. Each tube was sufficiently curved to allow it to be extracted through the steam drum, but sufficiently straight that a single tube could be replaced from a tube bank, without requiring other tubes to be removed so as to permit access. This was one of many features of the White-Forster intended to make it reliable in naval service and easy to maintain. These tubes were of particularly small diameter, only [...] and especially numerous, a total of 3,744 being used in some boilers. The tubes were arranged in 24 rows to a bank, each requiring a different length of tube, and 78 rows per drum. All tubes were curved to the same radius, facilitating repair and replacement on board, but requiring the tube holes in the drums to be reamed to precise angles on a jig during manufacture. This small <b>tube</b> <b>diameter</b> gave a high heating surface, but probably too much: the ratio of surface to volume became excessive and gas flow through the tube banks was affected, giving the boiler furnaces something of a reputation as poor burners.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{pressures}} are typically required to condense these new environmentally friendly refrigerants {{compared to those}} that are being phased out. Small <b>diameter</b> copper <b>tubes</b> are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> can withstand higher pressures than larger <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Hence, as <b>tube</b> <b>diameters</b> decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant. Therefore, refrigerant pressure drop factors due to small <b>diameter</b> <b>tubes</b> can be offset.|$|R
