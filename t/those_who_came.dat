5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> indifferent were sold, and even many of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

5|$|Byzantine Greeks, {{forming the}} {{majority}} of the Byzantine Empire proper at the height of its power, gradually came under the dominance of foreign powers with the decline of the Empire during the Middle Ages. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> under Arab Muslim rule, either fled their former lands or submitted to the new Muslim rulers, receiving the status of Dhimmi. Over the centuries these surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks in Arab realms evolved into Antiochian Greeks, Melchites or merged into the societies of Arab Christians, existing to this day.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the {{political}} elites consisted of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, as well as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> from prominent families which boasted an aristocratic ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since the first Song emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided most if not all officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). These great families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E
