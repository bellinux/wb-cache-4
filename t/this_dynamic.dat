However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.|$|E

25|$|A floating-point {{system can}} be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of {{different}} orders of magnitude: e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length. The result of <b>this</b> <b>dynamic</b> range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale.|$|E

25|$|This design {{gave the}} Amiga OS a great {{extensibility}} and flexibility within the limited memory capacity of {{computers in the}} 1980s. Sassenrath later noted that the design came as a necessity of trying to integrate into ROM dozens of internal libraries and devices including graphics, sound, graphical user interface, floppy disc, file systems, and others. <b>This</b> <b>dynamic</b> modular method also allowed hundreds of additional modules to be added by external developers over the years.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{programming}} approach {{is used in}} machine learning via the junction tree algorithm for belief propagation in graphs of bounded treewidth. It also {{plays a key role}} in algorithms for computing the treewidth and constructing tree decompositions: typically, such algorithms have a first step that approximates the treewidth, constructing a tree decomposition with this approximate width, and then a second step that performs dynamic programming in the approximate tree decomposition to compute the exact value of the treewidth.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{scenario}} is {{further complicated by}} the age-old problem of the possible identification between Nuragic people and the Shardana, one of the Sea peoples. Textual evidence from cuneiform tablets and Egyptian reliefs from the New Kingdom, relate that Sea Peoples were the final catalyst that put the fall of Aegean cities and Levantines states in motion. The Shardana apparently took part as mercenaries in several conflicts involving Ancient Egypt and are often associated with Sardinia.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{sheets and}} glaciers are flowing ice masses that rest on solid land. They are {{controlled}} by snow accumulation, surface and basal melt, calving into surrounding oceans or lakes and internal dynamics. The latter results from gravity-driven creep flow ("glacial flow") within the ice body and sliding on the underlying land, which leads to thinning and horizontal spreading. Any imbalance of <b>this</b> <b>dynamic</b> equilibrium between mass gain, loss and transport due to flow results in either growing or shrinking ice bodies.|$|E
25|$|The same dynamic {{programming}} method {{also can be}} applied to graphs with unbounded pathwidth, leading to algorithms that solve unparametrized graph problems in exponential time. For instance, combining <b>this</b> <b>dynamic</b> programming approach with the fact that cubic graphs have pathwidth n/6+o(n) shows that, in a cubic graph, the maximum independent set can be constructed in time O(2n/6+o(n)), faster than previous known methods. A similar approach leads to improved exponential-time algorithms for the maximum cut and minimum dominating set problems in cubic graphs, and for several other NP-hard optimization problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{covalent}} pair-wise {{interaction between}} boronic acids and hydroxy groups {{as found in}} alcohols and acids is rapid and reversible in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium established between boronic acids and the hydroxyl groups present on saccharides has been successfully employed to develop a range of sensors for saccharides. One of the key advantages with <b>this</b> <b>dynamic</b> covalent strategy lies {{in the ability of}} boronic acids to overcome the challenge of binding neutral species in aqueous media. If arranged correctly, the introduction of a tertiary amine within these supramolecular systems will permit binding to occur at physiological pH and allow signalling mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer mediated fluorescence emission to report the binding event.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of Shanna the She-Devil into Ka-Zar’s supporting cast changes Morse’s {{role in the}} stories of this period. Ka-Zar expresses clear attraction to the more jungle-friendly Shanna from the outset and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest. <b>This</b> <b>dynamic</b> is most notable in Morse’s lone appearance in the Ka-Zar strip in the black-and-white magazine Savage Tales (#8; Jan. 1975). Written by Gerry Conway, the story depicts Morse leading Shanna {{and a group of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into the Savage Land where they work with Ka-Zar to neutralise a threat to world security. During the course of the adventure Morse realises that Ka-Zar’s affections lie with Shanna. This story, first published in late-1974, is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka-Zar supporting character.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualitative}} {{review of}} previous literature looking at self-report data suggests {{that men and}} women use impression management tactics in the corporate world that are consistent with stereotypical gender roles when presenting themselves to others. This research proposes that women are put in a double bind where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change <b>this</b> <b>dynamic</b> the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|E
