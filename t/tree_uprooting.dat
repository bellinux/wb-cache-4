40|$|Wind {{damage is}} the most serious problem among all primary biotic and abiotic damage to European forests. <b>Tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> is {{generally}} reported as the major failure mode during windstorms. However the mechanism is largely unknown. A finite element model was developed to describe tree anchorage behaviour by root system architecture explicitly represented, roots and soil material properties and root-soil interactions. A constitutive law derived from damage mechanics has been implemented to model the individual root failure behaviour. The <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> process was described by sequential stiffness reduction and the overall failure of the root-soil system both driven by sequential root failure. Root responses to tree overturning were identified with respect to root classes then directly linked to the tree overall response during the process. Through a systematic evaluation of main root components in relation to tree anchorage strength, the taproot, large shallow roots and windward sinker roots are found to contribute most significantly to tree stability. An extensive sensitivity analysis based on Taguchi orthogonal array shows root system architecture play a predominant role over roots and soil material properties...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{mechanism}} of tree anchorage in a forest is a priority because {{of the increase in}} wind storms in recent years and their projected recurrence as a consequence of global warming. To characterize anchorage mechanisms during <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting,</b> we developed a generic finite element model where real three-dimensional (3 D) root system architectures were represented in a 3 D soil. The model was used to simulate tree overturning during wind loading, and results compared with real data from two poplar species (Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides). These trees were winched sideways until failure, and uprooting force and root architecture measured. The uprooting force was higher for P. deltoides than P. trichocarpa, probably due to its higher root volume and thicker lateral roots. Results from the model showed that soil type influences failure modes. In frictional soils, e. g., sandy soils, plastic failure of the soil occurred mainly on the windward side of the tree. In cohesive soils, e. g., clay soils, a more symmetrical slip surface was formed. Root systems were more resistant to uprooting in cohesive soil than in frictional soil. Applications of this generic model include virtual uprooting experiments, where each component of anchorage can be tested individuall...|$|E
40|$|Forest soil {{disturbance}} intervals {{are usually}} {{too long to}} measure using plot-based studies, and thus they are poorly understood. The mean soil disturbance interval (MSDI) in an old-growth forest {{on the west coast}} of Vancouver Island was estimated from radiocarbon dates of charcoal from organic and mineral soil horizons. Two assumptions are required to estimate the MSDI: (1) charcoal from forest fires is deposited within the organic horizon and eventually mixed into deeper mineral horizons by soil disturbances, and (2) the probability of soil disturbance is spatially homogeneous and affected only by the time since the last fire or the last soil disturbance. The MSDI is then estimated by {{the rate at which the}} proportion of undisturbed sample sites (determined by the proportion of sites with charcoal from the most recent fire in the organic horizon) decreases with increasing time since the last fire. Soil charcoal evidence of time since fire was determined at 83 sites using 141 radiocarbon dates. The estimated MSDI was greater on slopes (ca. 2010 years) than on terraces (ca. 920 years). The long periods between soil disturbances, especially on slopes, are consistent with other evidence from the study area that suggests infrequent <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> is the predominant mode of soil disturbance...|$|E

40|$|Invited by Danielle Arnaud, Jordan Kaplan and Philip Norman {{to be in}} {{this group}} {{exhibition}} at the Museum of Garden History, each artist selected was asked to choose a garden and team up with a Head Gardener of a particular type of garden (i. e. National Trust, allotment or park) to develop an idea relative to place. Choosing Packwood House, a National Trust property near Solihull, Boggon devised a video narrative that focussed on the famous topiary yews at Packwood. It investigated the symbolism of the yew tree and the legend that the seventeenth century yew tree garden is said to represent The Sermon on the Mount. The film created depicts a small Yew <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> itself and straying from the path of its elders in search of the unknown. Recreating a journey through meadows, bluebell woods, and the remaining structured garden with its mingled flowerbeds and array of colours, this journey is about naivety, curiosity, wonder and growth and ultimately about a sense of belonging. The film is set to music by Handel, which acknowledges the era of the house. Research included several site visits, including an informal tour with Michael Evans, the Head Gardener.

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of soil {{often do not}} reflect those of topographic controls. We attempted to identify possible causes of this by comparing observed and simulated soil horizon depths. Observed depths of E, Bt, BC, C 1 and C 2 horizons in loess-derived soils in Belgium showed a weak to absent relation to terrain attributes in a sloping area. We applied the soil genesis model SoilGen 2. 16 onto 108 1 x 1 m 2 locations in a 1329 ha area to find possible causes. Two scenarios were simulated. Model 1 simulated soil development under undisturbed conditions, taking slope, aspect and loess thickness as the only sources of variations. Model 2 additionally included a stochastic submodel to generate <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> events based on the exposure of trees to the wind. Outputs of both models were converted to depths of transitions between horizons, using an algorithm calibrated to horizon depths observed in the field. Model 1 showed strong correlations between terrain attributes and depths for all horizons, although surprisingly regression kriging {{was not able to}} model all variations. Model 2 showed a weak to absent correlation for the upper horizons but still a strong correlation for the deeper horizons BC, C 1 and C 2. For the upper horizons the spatial variation strongly resembled that of the measurements. This is a strong indication that bioturbation in the course of soil formation due to treefalls influences spatial {{patterns of}} horizon depths...|$|E
40|$|Management {{of paper}} birch in {{mixedwood}} stands is a {{sustainable forest management}} practice. In addition to the ecological and economical benefits of mixedwoods, paper birch trees can maintain or enhance slope stability. This thesis attempted to quantify the contribution of birch root reinforcement in BC to slope shear resistance. The objectives of this thesis were to determine the: 1) genetic variation in paper birch root reinforcement, 2) environmental variation in root reinforcement between birch and pine, and 3) differences in root reinforcement between birch and pine. The first study compared the contribution of birch and pine roots (from different populations growing in three soil types) to soil shear resistance using two controlled environment shear tests (Sonotube and Polytube Experiments). The second study (<b>Tree</b> <b>Uprooting</b> Experiment) compared the vertical uprooting resistance of birch and pine growing in different soil types at three field study sites. The third study (Genecology Experiment) determined the variation of four birch populations growing at one location. Results from the tube experiments found that the roots of birch and pine trees contributed to {{a significant increase in}} shear strength, regardless of soil type. At a depth of 20 - 44 cm, paper birch increased shear strength by as much 88 %, while pine increased strength by as much as 61 %. There was little variation in root reinforcement among the six birch populations in the Sonotube Experiment, which suggested that these trees were from one generalist population rather than six specialist populations. Soil texture affected the root reinforcement of birch and pine in the Polytube Experiment~ both species had the highest root reinforcement in coarse textured sand and the least root reinforcement in medium textured silt. The limiting factor in root reinforcement, in this case, was attributed to a lack of water and nutrients in the silt soil. In the <b>Tree</b> <b>Uprooting</b> Experiment, birch trees had 50 % greater resistance to uprooting than did pine trees. Small diameter birch and pine at Aleza Lake had greater uprooting resistance than birch and pine at other field sites. However, larger diameter trees at Gregg Creek and Red Rock had greater uprooting resistance than similar size trees at Aleza Lake. Soil strength and moisture content may have accounted for the uprooting resistance differences among diameter classes at Aleza Lake. Results from the Genecology Experiment showed that the Skeena population had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the greatest height, diameter, and root biomass compared to the other three populations. The results from companion trials, and from the uprooting tests suggested that Skeena trees represent a generalist population. In the same experiment, the nursery where the trees were grown impacted uprooting resistance, even after five years growing in the field. The results from this study reconfirmed the significant length of time nursery can affect field performance. Significant findings arising from this thesis were that: 1) birch saplings have greater root strength than pine across all soil types, 2) root system structure has an important role in root reinforcement between tree species, 3) root reinforcement is maximized by birch and pine when growing in freely drained, cohesionless sandy soil, and 4) further study of birch genecology is needed to identify generalist, high performing populations such as Skeena. Overall, managing for mixedwoods in BC has both ecological and economical benefits, including enhanced slope stability. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|PMA 06 : The Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling Simulation, Visualization and ApplicationsInternational audienceBackground and Aims: The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{has been}} used in recent years to {{simulate}} overturning processes in trees. This study aimed at using FEM to determine the role of individual roots in tree anchorage with regard to different rooting patterns, and to estimate stress distribution in the soil and roots during overturning. Methods: The FEM was used to carry out 2 -D simulations of <b>tree</b> <b>uprooting</b> in saturated soft clay and loamy sand-like soil. The anchorage model consisted of a root system embedded in a soil block. Two root patterns were used and individual roots removed to determine their contribution to anchorage. Key Results: In clay-like soil the size of the root–soil plate formed during overturning was defined by the longest roots. Consequently, all other roots localized within this plate had no influence on anchorage strength. In sand-like soil, removing individual root elements altered anchorage resistance. This result was due to a modification of the shape and size of the root–soil plate, as well as the location of the rotation axis. The tap root and deeper roots had more influence on overturning resistance in sand-like soil compared with clay-like soil. Mechanical stresses were higher in the most superficial roots and also in leeward roots in sand-like soil. The relative difference in stresses between the upper and lower sides of lateral roots was sensitive to root insertion angle. Assuming that root eccentricity is a response to mechanical stresses, these results explain why eccentricity differs depending on root architecture. Conclusions: A simple 2 -D Finite Element model was developed to better understand the mechanisms involved during tree overturning. It has been shown how root system morphology and soil mechanical properties can modify the shape of the root plate slip surface as well as the position of the rotation axis, which are major components of tree anchorage...|$|E
