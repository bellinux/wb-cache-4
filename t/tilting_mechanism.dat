5|$|In {{addition}} to tests in Sweden, the X2 was tried {{out on the}} Randsfjord Line on 12 March 1993. The order for the units was placed on 23 February 1995, after NSB had received bids from ABB (that later merged with Daimler's train division to become ADtranz), AEG, Fiat Ferroviaria, Talbot, Linke-Hofmann-Busch, Siemens and Görlitz. During 1996, an X2 train was rented to test out performance on the Norwegian railway system, and {{for a short period}} put into service on the Sørland Line. The first Class 71 unit was delivered on 19 September 1997, and the last on 30 January 1998. The last unit, no. 71.16, was delivered with <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> to be used to test performance on the Norwegian railways, due to the similarities between Class 71 and Class 73. It could be seen during the winter on the challenging Bergen Line and Dovre Line. After a few years the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was removed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, {{the novelty}} of the Pendolino has worn off and VR has even used the train in {{regional}} traffic between Oulu and Rovaniemi due to rail works in summer 2011. The problematic <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was not used during winter 2010–2011 and the time benefit of the tilting was not {{taken into account in}} timetables of winter 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|The Sm3 {{had a long}} {{prototype}} phase {{before the}} main series was ordered, with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time. Negative reporting continues to haunt the series' reputation. Reliability problems cannot be proven, as no statistics of specific train types are available. The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions, and the time benefit of the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> will not {{be taken into account}} in timetables of winter 2011–2012. Nevertheless, the Sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network.|$|E

5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has explored {{the concept of}} a Tilted Wheel, a newly proposed type of inertial actuator that can generate torques in all three principal axes of a rigid satellite using only a spinning wheel and a simple <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>tilts</b> the angular momentum vector about two axes providing two degree of freedom control, while variation of the wheel speed provides the third. The equations of motion of the system lead to a singularity-free system during nominal operation avoiding the need for complex steering logic. This paper describes the hardware design of the Tilted Wheel and the experimental setup behind an air bearing table used to test it. Experimental results from the air bearing table are provided with the results depicting the high performance capabilities of the proposed actuator in torque generation.

500|$|NSB Class 73 (...) is a {{class of}} 22 {{electric}} multiple units built by Adtranz for the Norwegian State Railways. The four-car trains were modifications of Class 71, which was again based on the Swedish X2. The A-series consists of 16 intercity trains; they were delivered in 1999 and 2000 and are used on the Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines. The intercity service was branded as Signatur until 2003.

500|$|VR {{announced}} its 2 billion Finnish Mark Pendolino order on 7 February 1992, {{consisting of two}} firm orders and twenty-three options. ABB's X 2000 was considered {{in addition to the}} Italian train; the latter was chosen due to its lower price (70 million FIM per unit) and because it was already running. Only these two tilting trains were considered due to the twisting nature Finland's railway network. Thanks to its <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the Pendolino [...] unlike such other European high-speed trains like the TGV, Thalys, and AVE [...] does not need to run on specialised high-speed lines, which was important to VR; instead, it runs on existing lines, and was expected to surpass the speed attained by traditional trains by 35%. This has both beneficial and negative consequences. The trains cannot run at as high a speed as, for example, the TGV, due to the lines. However, the Pendolino can also run alongside normal non-tilting trains, allowing for greater use of the railway. Building trains that could ensure passenger comfort at high speed on these routes by tilting through the curves was seen as a much cheaper solution than reconstructing the railway network itself due to Finland's low population and long distances. The train was originally called the Sm200, but in May 1995 it was officially named Sm3 according to VR's nomenclature for multiple units.|$|E
50|$|Both MineCam 1 and 2 {{needed to}} be lowered twice to {{investigate}} a shaft. First, they were lowered looking vertically down, and notes made of the depth and heading of any interesting features. The camera was then hauled {{to the surface and}} re-rigged to look horizontally at the interesting items found earlier. A remote <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> was needed as it would halve the time and effort.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the smaller cabin {{dimensions}} necessitated by the tilting geometry, the higher floor needed to package the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> themselves, and the need to provide disabled toilets, the units have a lower seating capacity than the nine-car Mark 2 and Mark 3 rakes that they replaced. The result has been severe overcrowding on some services, something that Virgin has somewhat mitigated through the increased frequency of service.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1970s, British Rail {{began to}} explore new {{technologies}} for enabling high-speed passenger rail services in the UK.

It was equipped with a <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> which allowed the train to tilt into bends to reduce cornering forces on passengers, and was powered by gas turbines (the first to be used on British Rail since the Great Western Railway, and subsequent Western Region utilised Swiss built Brown-Boveri, and British built Metropolitan Vickers locomotives (18000 and 18100) in the early 1950s). The 1970s oil crisis prompted a rethink in the choice of motive power (as with the prototype TGV in France), and British Rail later opted for traditional electric overhead lines when the pre-production and production APTs were brought into service in 1980-86.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the subway}} scene, the set was first {{planned to be}} shot in a real subway station, but due {{to the amount of}} the actions and the wire works, the {{decision}} was made to shoot on set.
