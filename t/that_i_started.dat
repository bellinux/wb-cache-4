25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> writing other travel articles.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, Bonnie Miller Rubin of the Chicago Tribune {{described}} TransGeneration as a pop-culture vehicle that [...] "helped trans issues gain more visibility". The show inspired writer/actor Megan McTavish to create a transgender character for All My Children, a US soap opera for which she was the head writer. [...] "I found [...] experiences so moving <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> thinking along those lines," [...] she said. The character she created, Zoe, was introduced in 2006, and was played by Jeffrey Carlson.|$|E
500|$|... "Mine" [...] {{was one of}} the {{fourteen}} tracks in Speak Now that was written solely by Swift. She also co-produced the song with Nathan Chapman, who co-produced all of Swift's studio albums. It was originally planned to be released on August 16, 2010, however, after the leak of an unauthorized low-quality mp3 file of the song, Big Machine Records decided to ship the song to country radio and iTunes twelve days earlier than planned on August 4, 2010. Swift commented that [...] "a leak is so out of my comfort zone, but it ended up good in the end. It made me so emotional <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> crying." ...|$|E

500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|Converge {{took their}} {{music in a}} more {{progressive}} direction with Axe to Fall. Kurt Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock {{over the last few}} years, and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar. He {{went on to say that}} he was getting the [...] "more straightforward, raw punk aggression out in a yet-to be named hardcore side project <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started.</b> So that leaves me free to get weird and progressive with Converge." [...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, You Fail Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E
500|$|As Salander's legal guardian, he {{uses his}} {{position}} to sexually abuse and eventually rape her. Salander turns the tables on him, torturing him and branding him as a rapist. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, {{although he did not}} want to emulate the stereotypical [...] "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a [...] "full-fledged human being" [...] and a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. [...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, [...] "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, a feud arose {{between the}} {{producer}} and R singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland {{failed to make}} an appearance at the singer's music video shoot of [...] "Get Involved". Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled [...] "Talk That". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold {{claim to be the}} inspiration for the dub-step music scene. [...] "The UK scene... they’re always telling me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> it. You have Dub-bass...". When questioned further about it he went on to say: [...] "It’s funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass." [...] In August 2010, a [...] "possible suicide attempt" [...] APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.|$|E
500|$|... "Intro (Listen To My Drama)" [...] is {{in a minor}} key and {{features}} a string ensemble and synthesizers. In the rap, Ivy Queen sings: [...] "1-9-9-3 was the year <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started,</b> Many have seen my rise and fall I've seen many. Vigilant, I have an angel on my back, I have a throne flanked by holy souls." [...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton. [...] "Te Voy A Recordar" [...] (I'm Going To Make You Remember), also in a minor key, also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers. Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her because they like her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E
2500|$|Patrick Moore, one of {{the initial}} founders of Greenpeace, said in a 2008 {{interview}} that, [...] "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> rethinking energy policy in general and realized that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."

2500|$|One of {{the pieces}} {{to appear on the}} album was Leonard Bernstein's [...] "Some Other Time". Evans started to play an {{introduction}} using an ostinato figure. However, according to Keepnews, who was present, the pianist spontaneously started to improvise over that harmonic frame, creating the recording that would be named [...] "Peace Piece". According to Evans: [...] "What happened was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to play the introduction, and it started to get so much of its own feeling and identity that I just figured, well, I'll keep going." [...] However, Gretchen Magee claims that the piece had been penned as an exercise during his college years, while Peri Cousins says that he would often play the piece at home.|$|E
2500|$|Some people, {{including}} former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the {{movement on the}} basis of the claim that nuclear power is necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia hypothesis, Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace and former director of Greenpeace International, George Monbiot and Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog. Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products. In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that [...] "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Wales was a keen {{reader with}} an acute {{intellectual}} curiosity. When he was three, his mother bought a World Book Encyclopedia from a door-to-door salesman. As {{he grew up}} and learned to read, it became an object of reverence. It put at his fingertips an abundant supply of knowledge complete with maps, illustrations, and a few cellophane layers of transparencies one could lift to explore {{such things as the}} muscles, arteries, and digestive system of a dissected frog. But Wales soon discovered that the World Book had shortcomings: no matter how much was in it, there were many more things that were not. World Book sent out stickers for owners to paste on the pages in order to update the encyclopedia, and Wales was careful to put the stickers to work, stating, [...] "I joke <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> as a kid revising the encyclopedia by stickering the one my mother bought." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sherwood's first Broadway play, The Road to Rome (1927), {{a comedy}} {{concerning}} Hannibal's botched invasion of Rome, introduced {{one of his}} favorite themes: the futility of war. Many of his later dramatic works employed variations of that motif, including Idiot's Delight (1936), which won Sherwood the first of four Pulitzer Prizes. According to legend, he once admitted to the gossip columnist Lucius Beebe, “The trouble with me is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> with a big message and end up with nothing but good entertainment.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In October 1965, {{prior to}} the expiry of her option, Fox {{assigned}} Harrison as the date of studio attorney Harry E. Sokolov for the premiere of The Agony and the Ecstasy. She was selected as Sokolov's date because [...] "Harry was from Baltimore." [...] Sokolov was also chief executive assistant to Fox's Vice President in Charge of Production, Richard D. Zanuck. Harrison was excited, because it was her first premiere, and because the film co-starred Charlton Heston, who had been her idol since she had seen Ben-Hur. At the post-premiere party, which she attended with her studio-assigned date, Harrison was thrilled to meet her longtime idol, Heston, with whom she would soon co-star in Planet of the Apes. At the premiere, Harrison met Zanuck, who was Sokolov's boss. Zanuck, Harrison said later, was immediately [...] "smitten" [...] and fell [...] "madly in love" [...] with her, and she with him. [...] "That was during the 60-day period <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> dating Richard, and then I was signed to a seven-year contract." [...] Harrison's acting career, {{as well as her}} life, became inextricably intertwined with their subsequent relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, she {{released}} [...] "Jikele" [...] as the album's third single. Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. All I knew was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E
