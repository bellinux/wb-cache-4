With this method, a means to power the strain gauge bridge is necessary, {{as well as a}} means to receive the signal from <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, or rotary transformers. Newer types of torque transducers add conditioning electronics and an A/D converter to <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> Stator electronics then read the digital signals and convert those signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/-10VDC.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{behaviors of}} <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> composite <b>shafts</b> containing randomly oriented reinforcements are studied in this paper. The Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory is adopted here {{to account for}} the interaction at the finite concentrations of reinforcements in the composite material. The effective elastic moduli of the composite material are expressed {{as a function of the}} phase properties, volume fraction, orientation angles of its constituents. The finite element model of <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> continuous fiber-reinforced composite shafts derived previously by authors is extended here to the case that contains the fiber inclusions by taking these effective elastic moduli into account. Based on this model, the natural frequencies of the stationary shafts, and the whirling speeds as well as the critical speeds of <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> are investigated. <b>The</b> results reveal that the content and the orientation of reinforcements have great influence on the dynamic characteristics of the composite shafts.

50|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal, {{also referred to}} as a mechanical face seal but usually simply as a mechanical seal, is a type of seal utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft.

40|$|Most of {{the shaft}} {{theories}} have based their analysis on bending moment, twisting moment or combined between them.

It is expected that the deflected shafts shall be exposed to this resistance, where these forces were not considered in the analysis before. The objective of the present work was to estimate the effect of internal torsional resistance in shafts which is caused by deflection, for the reason that it has the upper hand on misalignment problem. With the aim of fulfilling this objective, an experimental rig has been constructed to verify the existence of the torsional resistance in deflected shafts and its variation with the rotation angle...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in production and transmission of natural gas. Seals on <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> prevent <b>the</b> high-pressure natural gas from escaping the compressor casing. Traditionally, these seals used highpressure oil as a barrier against escaping gas. Natural Gas STAR partners have found that replacing these “wet ” (oil) seals with dry seals significantly reduces operating costs and methane emissions. Methane emissions from wet seals typically range from 40 to 200 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm). Most of these emissions occur when the circulating oil is stripped of the gas it absorbs at the high-pressure seal face. Dry seals, which use high-pressure gas to seal the compressor, emit less natural gas (up to 6 scfm for a two seal system), have lower power requirements, improve compressor an...|$|R
40|$|Imbalance faults {{constitute}} {{a significant portion}} of all faults in wind turbine generators (WTGs). WTG imbalance fault detection using generator current measurements has advantages over traditional vibration-based methods in terms of cost, implementation, and system reliability. However, there are challenges in using current signals for imbalance fault detection due to low signal-to-noise ratio of the useful information in current signals and non-stationary characteristic frequencies of imbalance faults. This paper proposes a method of using generator stator currents for imbalance fault detection of direct-drive WTGs. In the proposed method, <b>the</b> variable <b>shaft</b> <b>rotating</b> frequency of a WTG is estimated from one phase stator current measured from the generator terminal by using a phase-locked loop method. <b>The</b> estimated <b>shaft</b> <b>rotating</b> frequency is then processed by using appropriate up sampling and variable-rate down sampling algorithms. Consequently, the variable characteristic frequencies of imbalance faults in the spectrum of <b>the</b> estimated <b>shaft</b> <b>rotating</b> frequency are converted to constant values. Therefore, the signatures of wind turbine imbalance faults can be clearly identified from power spectral density analysis of <b>the</b> converted <b>shaft</b> <b>rotating</b> frequency signal. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to detect various imbalance faults in direct-drive WTGs...|$|R

50|$|Kingsbury’s {{research}} at the University of New Hampshire led him to conceive an early Kingsbury bearing that consisted of several stationary arc segments facing a thrust collar on <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> Each segment would have a boss on the side away from the thrust collar, allowing it to tilt and form an oil wedge that would carry the thrust. Kingsbury tested this new bearing with {{a modified version of}} his earlier screw thread testing machine. The bearing was successful with pressures of up to 4,000 psi at speeds of 285 rpm. This pressure exceeded that for common collar-type bearings by a factor of 80 to 100, thus proving the promise of the Kingsbury bearing.|$|E
50|$|Fretting wear {{can also}} occur during operation, causing deeper indentations. This occurs when small {{vibrations}} form in <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> and become harmonically {{in sync with}} the speed of rotation, causing circular oscillations in the shaft. The oscillation causes the shaft to move in precession, and the timing of the rotation speed causes the balls or rollers to contact the races only when they are in similar positions. This forms wear marks caused by contact with the bearings and the races in specific areas, but not in others, leaving an uneven wear-pattern that resembles brinelling. However, the marks are usually too wide and do not exactly match the shape of the bearing, and therefore this type of wear can be differentiated from true brinelling.|$|E
