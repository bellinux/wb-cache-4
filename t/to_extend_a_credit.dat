50|$|Reappearing as {{the rich}} Count of Monte Cristo, Dantès begins his revenge {{on the three}} men {{responsible}} for his unjust imprisonment: Fernand, now Count de Morcerf and Mercédès' husband; Danglars, now a baron and a wealthy banker; and Villefort, now procureur du roi. The Count appears first in Rome, where he becomes acquainted with the Baron Franz d'Épinay, and Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Fernand. Dantès arranges for the young Morcerf to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa and then seemingly rescues him from Vampa's gang. The Count then moves to Paris and dazzles Danglars with his wealth, persuading him <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> him <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> of six million francs. The Count manipulates the bond market and quickly destroys {{a large portion of}} Danglars' fortune. The rest of it begins to rapidly disappear through mysterious bankruptcies, suspensions of payment, and more bad luck in the Stock Exchange.|$|R
25|$|According to some reports, the People's Republic of China {{has offered}} <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> line of <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> South Sudan {{for several years}} while an {{alternative}} pipeline to the Kenyan coast is laid and an export deal is worked out with the Kenyan government, but this scenario is regarded as less likely than continued South Sudanese dependence on Sudanese infrastructure. If such a deal were struck, though, and South Sudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential trade partner and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South Sudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American companies doing business with Sudan.|$|R

The idea for Stilt struck them while developing an API which helped financial institutions determine risk of thin-file/no-file clients for a startup weekend contest. The idea received top honours, however the concept lay dormant for months. It was not until the two noticed a good deal of applicants signing up on their website, seeking personal loans.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the following question: what ties together the traditional commercial banking activities of deposit-taking and lending? We begin by observing that since banks often lend via commitments, or credit lines, their lending and deposit-taking may be two {{manifestations of the}} same primitive function: the provision of liquidity on demand. After all, once the decision <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> line of <b>credit</b> has been made, it is really {{nothing more than a}} checking account with overdraft privileges. This observation leads us to argue that there will naturally be synergies between the two activities, to the extent that both require banks to hold large volumes of liquid assets (cash and securities) on their balance sheets: if deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can share any deadweight costs of holding the liquid assets. We develop this idea with a simple model, and then use a variety of data to test the model's empirical implications. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{a recent}} day, I used my credit cards in {{connection}} with a number of minor transactions. I made eight purchases, and I paid two credit card bills. I also discarded (without opening) three solicitations for new cards, balance transfer programs, or other similar offers <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>credit</b> via <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> card. Statistics suggest that I am not atypical. U. S. consumers last year used credit cards in about 100 purchasing transactions per capita, with an average value of about $ 70. At the end of the year, Americans owed nearly $ 500 billion dollars, in the range of $ 1, 800 for every man, woman, and child in the population. Although the individual credit card transaction is small and routine, the transactions collectively {{have a significant effect on}} the overall stability of many American families, leading to a rise in consumer borrowing and an increase in bankruptcy filing rates. The crux of the borrowing problem is the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer, which the law relegates almost entirely to the private contractual relationships between those groups. Yet the existing literature has done little to assess the unique contracting problems that those transactions present. That is not to say that scholars. have overlooked credit cards. On the contrary, some scholars have noticed the lengthy fine-print agreements that issuers tender to their cardholders. Thus, credit cards have become a common topic in the boilerplate literature that culminates in the symposium for which this Article is prepared. The branch of that literature focused on consumer contracts explores the extent to which voluminous terms in adhesion contracts become enforceable without the type of voluntary and informed assent on which the paradigm of contract law rests. At the same time, other scholars have become increasingly concerned about the likelihood that cognitive and behavioral limitations restrict the ability of consumers to evaluate borrowing transactions effectively...|$|R

50|$|Offshore {{credit cards}} are credit cards issued by an {{offshore}} bank in a jurisdiction {{that is different from}} that of the cardholder. Real 'unsecured' offshore credit cards with credit lines are very difficult for the average person to obtain because banks refuse to issue them. Most banks will need possession of reliable <b>credit</b> histories and <b>a</b> means of getting their money back. If a customer is somewhere 'offshore' the risk of <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> line is too great and so as a result these cards are only issued to clients that have long standing relationships with the bank in question.|$|R
