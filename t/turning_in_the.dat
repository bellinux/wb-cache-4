5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{lower levels}} of the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located {{to the south of}} the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943 Dunglass {{attended}} the House of Commons {{for the first}} time since 1940, and began to make a reputation as a backbench member, particularly for his expertise in the field of foreign affairs. He foresaw a post-imperial future for Britain and emphasised the need for strong European ties after the war. In 1944, with the war now <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Allies' favour, Dunglass spoke eloquently about the importance of resisting the Soviet Union's ambition to dominate eastern Europe. His boldness in publicly urging Churchill not to give in to Joseph Stalin was widely remarked upon; many, including Churchill himself, observed that some of those once associated with appeasement were determined that it should not be repeated in the face of Russian aggression. Labour left the wartime coalition in May 1945 and Churchill formed a caretaker Conservative government, pending a general election in July. Dunglass was appointed to his first ministerial post: Anthony Eden remained in charge of the Foreign Office, and Dunglass was appointed as one of his two Under-secretaries of State.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Faxai {{began as}} an area of {{convection}} that persisted about 805kilometers (500mi) west of Guam on October24. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower levels of the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. Convection consolidated around {{the center of the}} low-level circulation, and the upper-level environmentlow wind shear and good divergencefavored development. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection deepened around a partially exposed low. The storm traveled northwest under the influences of a subtropical ridge to the north. At 0000UTC on October26, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as a tropical depression and gave it the local name Juaning. Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Faxai.|$|E

5|$|Why the Swedish fleet {{deviated}} {{from the original}} plan of engaging the allied force in home waters north of Öland has never been satisfactorily explained. According to Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on Kronan, Creutz made a turn because Uggla had signaled {{that he was going}} about. Rosenberg also believed that Bär on Nyckeln, admiral of the first squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla considered it necessary to follow this unplanned maneuver to keep the fleet together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both survived Svärdet, claimed that only Creutz as fleet commander could have made such a decision and that Uggla was only following Kronans lead. Witnesses who testified before the commission claimed that conflict between the officers was the reason that necessary precautions were not taken before Kronan came about. Rosenberg testified that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid Björnram and Major Klas Ankarfjäll had openly disagreed on how much sail should be set and how close to land the ship should sail. According to Gyllenspak, senior fleet pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his concerns against <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rough weather, but no one had heeded his advice.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, {{with the}} war clearly <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Allies favor, Winston Churchill formed a series of {{committees}} to consider post-war redevelopment.

To consider this, in September 1943 Churchill formed the Television Committee, better known to history as the Hankey Committee.|$|E

25|$|Loy {{ploughing}} {{was a form}} {{of manual}} ploughing in Ireland, on very small farms– or on very hilly ground, where horses could not work or where farmers could not afford them. It was used up until the 1960s in poorer land. This suited the moist climate of Ireland, as the trenches formed by <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sods provided drainage. It also allowed the growing of potatoes in bogs as well as on mountain slopes where no other cultivation could take place.|$|E
25|$|The authors say the {{previous}} Fourth <b>Turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US {{began with the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929 and climaxed {{with the end of}} World War II. The G.I.

The authors assert the Millennial Generation (which they also describe as a Hero archetype, born 1981 to 2004) show many similar traits to those of the G.I. youth, which they describe as including: rising civic engagement, improving behavior, and collective confidence.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{there was}} {{discussion}} in the MCC about possibly removing the Grace Gates {{to another part of}} Lord's. This was discussed after consideration of the MCC's planned redevelopment of Lord's with the Grosvenor Group and because the gates were being constantly damaged by supply lorries <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the gates. However the MCC members voted against moving the gates. In 2013, as part of a revised redevelopment of Lord's, it was announced that a new entrance would be built into Lord's to supersede the Grace Gates as the entrance for MCC members. The gates themselves would be locked for three years while the pavilion end is redeveloped.|$|E

25|$|Zvezda uses {{gyroscopes}} and thrusters to turn itself around. Gyroscopes do {{not require}} propellant, rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section. When gyroscopes 'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. During Expedition 10, an incorrect command {{was sent to the}} station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters. When an ATV, NASA Shuttle, or Soyuz is docked to the station, it {{can also be used to}} maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting. Shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.|$|E
25|$|Gamlin {{played as}} a tail-ender {{right-handed}} batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler in two consecutive matches in July 1895. In the first, {{he failed to}} score a run or take a wicket against Essex at Taunton. Essex's total of 692 was the team's highest first-class score for 95 years until surpassed in 1990. Gamlin's second match, against Lancashire, also at Taunton, was even more difficult; Lancashire scored 801 and captain Archie MacLaren scored 424, the first score of more than 400 runs by an individual batsman in first-class cricket. MacLaren finally fell to Gamlin's off-spin, and Gamlin took the last wicket of the innings as well, perversely <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best bowling figures of his short first-class career in this innings by taking two for 100. He failed to score in this match too. After four consecutive scores of 0, he finally made 2 and 5 in his single match in 1896, against Yorkshire, but he failed to take any further wickets, {{and this was the}} final first-class match of his career.|$|E
25|$|By July {{the tide}} was <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentarians' favour: bombardment, scurvy, lack of water, perhaps a {{shortage}} of gunpowder {{and the threat of}} starvation and only 25 men fit to fight meant that the castle surrendered on 25 July 1645. Only about half of the original 500 defenders emerged alive. Subsequently the castle was repaired and rearmed for Parliament with a company of 160. Matthew Boynton, the castle's new governor, declared for the king on 27 July 1648 when the soldiers went unpaid. This led to a second siege which brought the castle back under Parliamentary control on 19 December, when the garrison was defeated as much by the oncoming winter as by the Parliamentary forces. The castle changed hands seven times between 1642 and 1648. The castle was later used as a prison for those who were deemed to be enemies of the Commonwealth of England, the country's brief period of republicanism; the shell of the keep survives, minus the west wall, which was destroyed in the bombardment. The castle was returned to the Crown following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.|$|E

30|$|The {{participant}} {{was instructed to}} expand the hybrid MARME by 1  mm/day for 7  days (2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and 2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening). One week later, all participants presented for expansion assessment; if satisfactory, the {{participant was}} then instructed to constrict the maxilla by unwinding the hybrid MARME by 1  mm/day (2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and 2 <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening) for 7  days. This cycle was repeated until week 9. After 9  weeks of alternating expansion and contraction, the mobility of the maxilla was subjectively and manually assessed. This was done by supporting the forehead and bridge of the participant’s nose {{with one hand and}} holding the maxillary incisors with the other. The maxilla was then moved in an anterior and posterior direction to detect the mobility of the maxilla. When sufficient mobility “disarticulation” was achieved, the second phase (the protraction phase) of treatment commenced.|$|R
25|$|The {{outcome of}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout led to the {{shrinking}} of the payroll to $26million. The Hurricanes, however, {{turned out to be}} one of the NHL's biggest surprises, <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best season in the franchise's 34-year history. They finished the regular season with a 52–22–8 record and 112 points, shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points (in the WHA) set by the 1972–73 Whalers and 93 points (in the NHL) set in 1986–87. It was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50-win and 100-point plateaus. The 112-point figure was good for fourth overall in the league, easily their highest overall finish as an NHL team (tied with the third-overall Dallas Stars in points, but with one fewer win than the Stars) and second in the East (one point behind the Ottawa Senators). The Hurricanes also ran away with their third Southeast Division title, finishing 20 points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Attendance increased from 2003–04, averaging just under 15,600 per game, and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford.|$|E
