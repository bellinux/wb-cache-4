It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow Complex. Chair had sold the licensing of Empire <b>to</b> <b>Card,</b> {{which became a}} best-selling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe {{and that it would}} have focused on the Battle Room.|$|E

25|$|Card {{counting}} is {{most rewarding}} {{near the end}} of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>card</b> counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.|$|E
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked <b>to</b> sort <b>cards</b> {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy <b>to</b> sort <b>cards</b> based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able <b>to</b> sort <b>cards</b> based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch <b>to</b> sort the <b>cards</b> based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able <b>to</b> sort <b>cards</b> based on one dimension and can then switch <b>to</b> sorting <b>cards</b> on a second dimension.|$|R

25|$|She once {{lost the}} huge sum of 84,000 francs—some of it borrowed—in one {{evening at the}} table at the court of Fontainebleau, <b>to</b> <b>card</b> cheats. To quickly raise the money to pay back her debts, she devised an ingenious {{financing}} arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.|$|E
25|$|These {{fees are}} {{typically}} from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary {{not only from}} merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates), but also from card <b>to</b> <b>card,</b> with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use cash, debit cards, or even cheques.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} <b>to</b> <b>card</b> security {{have been}} introduced to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the Secure POS Vendor Alliance.|$|E

25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of {{revolving}} credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card <b>to</b> <b>card,</b> and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.|$|E
25|$|Level / Rank : This is {{indicated}} {{by the number of}} Level Stars shown under the monster card's name. With a normal summon, players can summon one Level 4 or lower monster card to the field. A player can also perform a Tribute Summon, which is necessary to summon monsters that are Level 5 or higher. In a Tribute Summon the player tributes monsters already on the field to the Graveyard. Level 5 and Level 6 monsters require one tribute, while Level 7 and higher monsters require two tributes. Some monsters may require a different number of tributes than their Level would suggest due <b>to</b> <b>card</b> effects. Levels are also important in other ways, such as summoning Ritual or Synchro Monsters. Xyz Monsters do not possess Levels but instead hold Ranks, indicated by black and yellow stars on the left of the card, relevant to the levels of the monsters required to summon it. As such, Xyz Monsters are unaffected by effects which target monsters with Levels and cannot be used for Ritual or Synchro summoning, just like Link Monsters who have neither Ranks nor Levels.|$|E
25|$|Pokémon Trading Card Game is a {{video game}} {{simulation}} of the original tabletop collectible card game with role-playing elements similar to earlier titles in the Pokémon series. Players control a young boy and must travel around the game world interacting with non-player characters and challenging them <b>to</b> <b>card</b> battles using 60-card decks. During gameplay, the player must defeat eight Club Masters, each with a different deck representing one of the game's elemental card types, allowing them to face four Grand Masters and earn the right to inherit four powerful Legendary Cards. A total of 226 cards exist within the game, which include cards from the first three sets of the real-life game, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. The player is {{given the opportunity to}} choose one of three starter decks at the start of their journey, each containing Pokémon cards revolving around the three possible starting creatures from Pokémon Red and Blue. As players defeat opponents, they are rewarded with booster packs containing a random assortment of additional cards they may use in their deck, with up to four separate decks able to be saved at a time.|$|E

25|$|Related <b>to</b> <b>card</b> {{shuffling}} {{are several}} other problems of counting special kinds of permutations {{that are also}} answered by the Bell numbers. For instance, the nth Bell number equals number of permutations on n items in which no three values that are in sorted order have the last two of these three consecutive. In a notation for generalized permutation patterns where values that must be consecutive are written adjacent to each other, and values that can appear non-consecutively are separated by a dash, these permutations {{can be described as}} the permutations that avoid the pattern 1-23. The permutations that avoid the generalized patterns 12-3, 32-1, 3-21, 1-32, 3-12, 21-3, and 23-1 are also counted by the Bell numbers. The permutations in which every 321 pattern (without restriction on consecutive values) can be extended to a 3241 pattern are also counted by the Bell numbers. However, the Bell numbers grow too quickly to count the permutations that avoid a pattern that has not been generalized in this way: by the (now proven) Stanley–Wilf conjecture, the number of such permutations is singly exponential, and the Bell numbers have a higher asymptotic growth rate than that.|$|E

500|$|The next year, a Florida {{postal worker}} won {{the card and}} {{auctioned}} it at Christie's for $640,000 to collector Michael Gidwitz. In 2000, the card was sold via Robert Edward Auctions <b>to</b> <b>card</b> collector Brian Seigel for $1.27 million. In February 2007, Seigel sold the card privately to an anonymous collector for $2.35 million. Less than six months later, the card was sold to another anonymous collector for $2.8 million. In April 2011, that anonymous purchaser was revealed to be Ken Kendrick, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks. A different card, named the [...] "Jumbo Wagner" [...] was sold at auction again in 2016 for a record $3.12 million.

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites <b>to</b> <b>card</b> tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|The Chrono Cross team devised an {{original}} battle system using a stamina bar and Elements. Kato planned the system around allowing players to avoid repetitive gameplay (also known as [...] "grinding") to gain combat experience. Hiromichi Tanaka likened the Elements system <b>to</b> <b>card</b> games, hoping players would {{feel a sense}} of complete control in battle. The team programmed each battle motion manually instead of performing motion capture. Developers strove to include tongue-in-cheek humor in the battle system's techniques and animations to distance the game from the Final Fantasy franchise. Masato Kato planned for the game's setting to feature a small archipelago, for fear that players would become confused traveling in large areas with respect to parallel worlds. He hoped El Nido would still impart a sense of grand scale, and the development team pushed hardware limitations in creating the game's world. To create field maps, the team modeled locations in 3D, then chose the best angle for 2D rendering. The programmers of Chrono Cross did not use any existing Square programs or routines to code the game, instead writing new, proprietary systems. Other innovations included variable-frame rate code for fast-forward and slow-motion gameplay (awarded as a bonus for completing the game) and a [...] "CD-read swap" [...] system to allow quick data retrieval.|$|E
