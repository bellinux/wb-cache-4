He labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span. After arriving in Roswell, Goddard applied for life insurance, but when the company doctor examined him he said that Goddard belonged in a bed in Switzerland (where he could get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care).</b> Goddard's health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of Maryland to work for the Navy. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945. He continued to work, able to speak only in a whisper, until surgery was required, and he died in August of that year in Baltimore, Maryland. He was buried in Hope Cemetery in his home town of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E
25|$|When war was {{declared}} in Europe in 1914, {{there was only}} one military hospital in Van, Turkey, which was soon overcrowded with wounded and sick people. The conditions were extremely bad; There were only two surgeons and no nurses, only male soldiers helping. The conditions on the whole in the Ottoman army were almost bad beyond description. Soldiers, even at the front and who received <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> in comparative terms, were often (a) undernourished, (b) underclothed; troops deployed at high altitude in the mountains of Eastern Anatolia often had only summer clothes; Ottoman soldiers in Palestine often took great risks just to rob the British dead of their boots and even clothing; and (c) largely suffering from diseases (primarily cholera and typhus), which took many more lives than the actual fighting. The German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, in a report he wrote to army group headquarters on 20 October 1917, describes how a division (the 24th) that departed from Istanbul-Haydarpaşa Terminal with 10,057 men arrived at the Palestinian Front with only 4,635. 19% of the men had to be admitted to hospitals since they were suffering from various diseases, 24% had deserted and 8% were allocated on the way to various local needs.|$|E

[...] Since 1968, the community has gathered each night to pray and read from the Bible, reflecting on the Gospel, eventually spreading throughout the world with a mission of helping those in need. Their activities include setting up refuges for the old, hospices for AIDS patients, and printing a handbook titled [...] "Where to Eat, Sleep, and Wash in Rome" [...] as gifts to the homeless.

2500|$|Patient-Physician {{communication}} involves two sides. While {{physicians and}} other healthcare providers are being encouraged or {{required to be}} culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services. Recognizing that patients receive <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> when they work in partnership with doctors, the General Medical Council issued guidance for patients [...] "What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients" [...] in April 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{there have}} been a number of {{proposals}} to change Medicare from a publicly run social insurance program with a defined benefit, for which there is no limit to the government’s expenses, into a program that offers [...] "premium support" [...] for enrollees. The basic concept behind the proposals is that the government would make a defined contribution, that is a premium support, to the health plan of a Medicare enrollee's choice. Insurers would compete to provide Medicare benefits and this competition would set the level of fixed contribution. Additionally, enrollees would be able to purchase greater coverage by paying more in addition to the fixed government contribution. Conversely, enrollees could choose lower cost coverage and keep the difference between their coverage costs and the fixed government contribution. The goal of premium Medicare plans is for greater cost-effectiveness; if such a proposal worked as planned, the financial incentive would be greatest for Medicare plans that offer <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> at the lowest cost.|$|E

Fellow Boston Elk lodge member and actor Nat Goodwin, a writer said around that time, [...] "repeatedly urged Kelly to abandon his diamond affiliations and embrace the fascinations of stage life, Goodwin {{claiming}} that Kelly is a natural born comedian." [...] Goodwin, a native of Boston, had been a founder of its Elks lodge in 1878. George W. Floyd, Goodwin's manager and a native of nearby Quincy, was also a charter member of the lodge {{and one of its}} early directors. [...] Floyd was arguably the first player agent in baseball history. For example, in 1892, Floyd told the Chicago Herald that he had secured Kelly's new contract with Boston. It included a percentage of the club's earnings above $10,000. Floyd also said, [...] "Kelly is taking <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> of himself and is well fixed.

2500|$|As the British {{entered the}} Chesapeake, Secretary Monroe ordered Chief Clerk John Graham and Stephen Pleasonton to [...] "take <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>care</b> {{of the books}} and papers of the office which might be in [...] power." [...] In {{addition}} to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, official records of the Continental Congress and original laws and statutes were hid in hastily made linen bags, loaded onto carts and taken across the Chain Bridge into Virginia. The rescued documents were first hidden in an unoccupied gristmill two miles (3km) upriver from Georgetown. Fearing the documents were still unsafe, Pleasonton hired horses and wagons from local farmhouses and transported them to Leesburg, Virginia, where they were stored in an empty house, locked and in the safekeeping of Rev. Mr. Littlejohn, until the British retreated from Washington. Reporting to the Congress on November 14, 1814, Secretary Monroe said that [...] "Every exertion was made, and every means employed, {{for the removal of}} the books and papers of this office, to a place of safety; and notwithstanding the extreme difficulty of obtaining the means of conveyance, it is believed that every paper and manuscript book of the office, of any importance... were placed in a state of security.... Many of the books belonging to the Library of the Department, as well as some letters on file of minor importance... were unavoidably left, and shared the fate, it is presumed, of the building in which they were deposited." ...|$|E
