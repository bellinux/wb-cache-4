2500|$|Senior Airbus executive, Fabrice Bregier, said on 30 May 2015 {{that there}} was [...] "either a {{weakness}} in <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> of planes before they fly, or a problem that results from the implementation of these procedures." [...] On 3 June 2015 Airbus announced that investigators had confirmed [...] "that engines one, two and three experienced power frozen after lift-off and {{did not respond to}} the crew's attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Preliminary analyses have shown that all other aircraft systems performed normally and did not identify any other abnormalities throughout the flight." [...] The key scenario being examined by investigators is that the torque calibration parameter data was accidentally wiped on three engines as the engine software was being installed at Airbus facilities, which would prevent the FADECs from operating. Under the A400M's design, the first warning pilots would receive of the engine data problem would be when the plane was 120 meters (400 feet) in the air; on the ground, there is no cockpit alert.|$|E

40|$|Following (1), (2) and (3), who {{proposed}} {{a test of}} uniformity based on m-th order disjoint sample spacings, we propose its analog based on m-th order overlapping sample spacings. Three interesting and intuitively appealing motivations, in favor of <b>the</b> proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> are given. Asymptotic, normality of <b>the</b> proposed <b>test</b> statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives. <b>The</b> proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be consistent against a large class of alternatives. For a sequence of local alternatives, which, converges to the null hypothesis {{at the rate of}} n(- 1 / 4), <b>the</b> proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with three existing <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. <b>the</b> Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed in (4), which is known to be locally most powerful among all <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> based symmetrically on spacings, a procedure due to (5) and a procedure due to (3)), in terms of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency.

40|$|Quality {{management}} {{is very important}} for many manufacturing industries. Process capability analysis has been widely applied in the field of quality control to monitor the performance of industrial processes. Hence, the lifetime performance index CL is utilized to measure the performance of product, where L is the lower specification limit. This study constructs a Bayesian estimator of CL under a Rayleigh distribution with the upper record values. The Bayesian estimations are based on squared-error loss function, linear exponential loss function, and general entropy loss function, respectively. Further, the Bayesian estimators of CL are utilized to construct <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> for CL based on a credible interval in the condition of known L. <b>The</b> proposed <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> not only can handle nonnormal lifetime data, but also can handle the upper record values.
