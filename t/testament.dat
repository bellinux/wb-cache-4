5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek New <b>Testament,</b> as well as the Septuagint. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the New <b>Testament,</b> and the only ancient manuscript of the New <b>Testament</b> written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it {{is considered}} to be more accurate than most later New <b>Testament</b> copies in preserving superior readings where many later manuscripts are in error.|$|E
5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New <b>Testament,</b> the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic {{text in the}} New <b>Testament,</b> Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old <b>Testament</b> appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old <b>Testament</b> quotations in New <b>Testament</b> more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New <b>Testament</b> as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old <b>Testament</b> as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New <b>Testament)</b> (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New <b>Testament</b> demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

5|$|While large {{portions}} of the Old <b>Testament</b> are missing, {{it is assumed that}} the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments.

40|$|<b>Testaments</b> {{are unique}} {{resource}} {{in the search}} for an understanding of the everyday lives of the residents of medieval towns. Through this medium it is possible to investigate religiosity, to analyse the social stratification of the population, and to map property relationships, family life or the relationship of individuals to death. In this country they have survived in a number of towns, including Český Brod, Plzeň (Pilsen), Kutná Hora, Litomyšl, Soběslav and Kadaň. The greatest number of <b>testaments</b> are found in Prague, where collections survive in the municipal rolls, along with inventories of effects in later periods, for almost the entire period from the 15 th through to the 19 th centuries. The oldest Czech <b>testaments</b> are in the memorial books of the Prague Old Town (MS 986, Liber vetustissimus) and date to the period beginning 1360 and ending 1419.

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New <b>Testament.</b> It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New <b>Testament</b> in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of the New <b>Testament</b> published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E

Another facsimile of the New <b>Testament</b> text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the Codex became widely available.|$|E
