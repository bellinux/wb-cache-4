50|$|Senator Gallinger is {{a public}} speaker <b>of</b> <b>wide</b> <b>repute</b> and his {{services}} are in constant demand in many states in every campaign. The larger portion of his political activity in this line, however, he devotes to his own state, where no advocate of party policies is more eagerly heard or more enthusiastically welcomed. In 1898 Senator Gallinger was again called to {{the chairmanship of the}} Republican state committee, and was re-elected to that position in 1900 and in 1902. In 1900 he again headed his states delegation at the Republican National Convention, and in 1901 he was made the New Hampshire member of the Republican National Committee.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{speculation}} about suitable {{names for the}} new Chancellor centred on Earl Mountbatten of Burma, or the Duke of Gloucester. An editorial in the student newspaper Varsity on 14 October 1950 began by stating clearly [...] "The person {{we would like to}} see installed as Chancellor of Cambridge University is obviously someone <b>of</b> <b>wide</b> <b>repute</b> within the British Commonwealth" [...] and suggested that Pandit Nehru, Prime Minister of India, was such a person. The editorial praised Nehru for maintaining impartiality in the Korean War, repeatedly advising peaceful resolution of international disputes, and not allowing India to become part of the spheres of influence of either the USA or USSR. Nehru had studied at Cambridge (Trinity College, 1907-1910).|$|R
40|$|The {{complacency}} {{with which}} congenital anomalies were once interpreted as expressions of faulty inheritance was rudely shaken in 1940. A convincing demonstration had just occurred in Australia that German measles contracted early in pregnancy {{by the mother}} may initiate congenital cataract, deafness, or congenital heart disease in the fetus. A great area for medical exploration had opened. To appreciate {{the consequences of the}} discovery, consider the impact on the then current interpretation of congenital cataract-that its presence or absence was determined by genetic factors. Almost without dissent or even questioning, the clinical entity was presumed by physicians to be an inherited defect. For example, in one textbook <b>of</b> <b>wide</b> <b>repute,</b> the occurrence <b>of</b> a single case of congenital cataract in a family of over 40 members was interpreted as indicating a mutation. At the time the book was prepared no one could challenge the inference as unreasonable, but after 1940 anyone had the right to raise the questions: "How do we know that the mother didn't have rubella durin...|$|R
