Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a <b>true</b> <b>vertical</b> drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E

500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a <b>true</b> <b>vertical</b> drop. [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels out, slowly {{travelling}} around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls around back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied voice saying 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge of the drop.|$|E

Smith had four receptions for 55yards in the 31–7 loss to Clemson, but was hindered by his sore ankle which {{kept him out of}} practice. Smith said, [...] "I don't like sitting out [...] I feel like I'm leaving my teammates out to dry. I didn't battle with them all week."

40|$|Using {{turbulent}} MHD simulations (magnetic Reynolds numbers up to ≈ 8000) and Hinode observations, {{we study}} effects of turbulence on measuring the solar magnetic field outside active regions. Firstly, from synthetic Stokes V profiles for the FeI lines at 6301 and 6302 ˚A, {{we show that}} a peaked probability distribution function (PDF) for observationally-derived field estimates {{is consistent with a}} monotonic PDF for actual vertical field strengths. Hence, the prevalence of weak fields is greater than would be naively inferred from observations. Secondly, we employ the fractal self-similar geometry of the turbulent solar magnetic field to derive two estimates (numerical and observational) of the <b>true</b> mean <b>vertical</b> unsigned flux density. We also find observational evidence that the scales of magnetic structuring in the photosphere extend at least down to an order of magnitude smaller than 200 km: the self-similar power-law scaling in the signed measure from a Hinode magnetogram ranges (over two decades in length scales and including the granulation scale) down to the ≈ 200 km resolution limit. From the self-similar scaling, we determine a lower bound for the <b>true</b> quiet-Sun mean <b>vertical</b> unsigned flux density of ∼ 50 G. This is consistent with our numericallybased estimates that 80 % or more of the vertical unsigned flux should be invisible to Stokes−V observations at a resolution of 200 km owing to the cancellation of signal from opposite magnetic polarities.

And, in buildings, this threatening should be somewhat carried down into their mass. A mere projecting shelf is not enough, the whole wall must, Jupiter like, nod as well as frown. Hence, I think the propped machicolations of the Palazzo Vecchio and Duomo of Florence far grander headings than any form of Greek cornice. Sometimes the projection may be thrown lower, as in the Doge's palace of Venice, where the chief appearance of it is above the second arcade; or it may become a grand swell from the ground, as the head of a ship of the line rises from the sea. This is very nobly attained by the projection of the niches in the third story of the Tour de Beurre at Rouen.|$|E

The cancellation function of the vertical flux density from a Hinode SP observation is found to follow a self-similar power law over two decades in length scales down to the ~ 200 km resolution limit. This provides observational evidence that the scales of magnetic structuring in the photosphere extend at least down to 20 km.

30|$|Seeing IC {{as if it}} were a {{cultural}} identity negotiation processes, also seems to be the position assumed by Kastoryano (2018). This is a view of IC-as-dialogue we must reject. Indeed, IC promotes contact, but not with the purpose of offering some forum of negotiations amongst people in relation to their cultural identities. The view of contact-as-negotiation could only be seen in what I called the political and contractual strand of IC, the one that focuses on the link between Diversity, national and cultural traditions. But this negotiation is not done among people. It is the basic view of the Quebecois understanding of IC illustrated by Bouchard (2015). It is <b>true</b> that this <b>vertical</b> level still needs to be incorporated into the European debate, since most of the public discussions on Britishnes, Frechness are based on this process of negotiation between diversity and an essentialist view of cultural tradition and national identity, which is for me a much closer illustration of remaining romanticism.

Different geometrical configurations were considered in order to investigate the main characteristics of the flow {{as a function of}} the aspect ratio (AR) of the canopy. To this end, a summary of the two-dimensional fields of the fundamental turbulence parameters is given for AR ranging from 1 to 2. The results show that the flow field depends strongly on AR only within the canyon, while the outer flow seems to be less sensitive to this parameter. This is not <b>true</b> for the <b>vertical</b> momentum flux, which is one of the parameters most affected by AR, both within and outside the canyon. The experiments also indicate that, when (i. e. the skimming flow regime), the roughness sub-layer extends up to a height equal to 1. 25 times the height of the obstacles (H), surmounted by an inertial sub-layer that extends up to 2. 7 H. In contrast, for (i. e. the wake-interference regime) the inertial sub-layer is not present. This has significant implications when using similarity laws for deriving wind and turbulence profiles in canopy flows. Furthermore, two estimations of the viscous dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy of the flow are given. The first one is based on the fluctuating strain rate tensor, while the second is related to the mean strain rate tensor. It is shown that the two expressions give similar results, but the former is more complicated, suggesting that the latter might be used in numerical models with a certain degree of reliability.

40|$|The {{influence}} of elastic anisotropy on seismic wave propagation is often neglected {{for the sake}} of simplicity. However, ignoring anisotropy may lead to significant errors in the processing of seismic data and ultimately in a poor image of the subsurface. This is especially <b>true</b> in wide-aperture <b>Vertical</b> Seismic Profiles where waves travel both vertically and horizontally. Anisotropy has been neglected in wavefront construction methods of seismic ray-tracing until Gibson (2000), who showed they are powerful tools to simulate seismic wave propagation in three-dimensional anisotropic subsurface models. The code is currently under development using a C++ object oriented programming approach because it provides high flexibility in the design of new components and facilitates debugging and maintenance of a complex algorithm. So far, the code was used to simulate propagation in homogeneous or simple heterogeneous anisotropic velocity models mainly designed for testing purposes. In particular, it has never been applied to simulate a field dataset. We propose here an analytical method involving little algebra and that allows the design of realistic heterogeneous anisotropic models using the C++ object oriented programming approach. The new model class can model smooth multi-layered subsurface with gradients or models with many dip variations. It has been used to model first arrival times of a wide-aperture VSP dataset from the Gulf of Mexico to estimate the amount of anisotropy. The proposed velocity model is transversely isotropic. The anisotropy is constant throughout the model and is defined via Thomsen's parameters. Values in the final model are epsilon = 0. 055 and delta = - 0. 115. The model is compatible with the a priori knowledge of the local geology and reduces the RMS average time difference between measured and computed travel times by 51 % in comparison to the initial isotropic model. These values are realistic and are similar to other measurements of anisotropy in the Gulf of Mexico...|$|R
