She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E

Welles concludes the film in his position as a monologuist, proclaiming: [...] "There are too many regrets, there are too many things I wish I could have done over again. If it wasn't a memory, if it was a project for the future, talking about Othello would have been nothing but delight. After all, promises are more fun than explanations.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} Filipino dishes {{and they can be}} categorized by soups, meat dishes, beverages, and desserts. Things that would naturally describe any typical Filipino American dish can be a soup, ulam(any food), kanin(rice), type of meat, fruits, and dipping sauces. Of course any culture will have a huge variety of food, but these foods can be catergorized into their individual sections. The first section <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the soup section. This section can include many different soups, but some may include things such as Munnggo gisado masabaw. This soup starts off with the base which is Mung beans. Then the rest is basically picking a protein which can be pork or shrimp. One other soup dish would include pansit molo. This is basically a Filipino style of the Chinese wonton soup. The next section would be the meat dishes. Of course like soup, there {{are many different}} types of meat dishes. One dish is called Adobo. This dish can be made in 2 ways, one with pork or with chicken. After choosing a meat, you take the dish and cook it with the use of vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. Of course any dish has its variation down to every ingredient possible when making the dish, and adobo is a dish that can have many different possible variations. [...] Suman banana leaves that contain sticky rice that can be dipped in sugar to make it sweeter if necessary. Taho is a dessert that uses a syrup and boba inside of a jello like soybean material. There are numerous amounts of different Filipino dishes, and these are only a couple of them.|$|E
