In vain he sought for a creek or feeder that flowed truly south toward the McQuestion and the Stewart. Then came a mountain storm that blew a blizzard across the riff-raff of high and shallow divides. Above timber-line, fireless, for two days, he struggled blindly to find lower levels. On the second day he came out upon the rim of an enormous palisade. So thickly drove the snow that he could not see the base of the wall, nor dared he attempt the descent. He rolled himself in his robes and huddled the dogs about him in the depths of a snow-drift, but did not permit himself to sleep.|$|E

5000|$|The {{site was}} {{initially}} explored by the American archaeologist Harriet Boyd Hawes in 1900, [...] "as {{representative of the}} American School of Classical Studies at Athens to excavate {{in the name of}} the Cretan Government." [...] Boyd uncovered a large [...] "house" [...] with storerooms (now designated Building A-B) on the summit, an [...] "excellent stretch of wall" [...] (now called the East Terrace Wall), and eight small tholos tombs (now labeled Vronda I-VIII) on the north and northwest sides of the ridges. Another tholos tomb (now designated Vronda IX) was discovered in 1951 by a local landowner, George Sekadakis, who deposited the antiquities with the local authorities. Archaeological investigations were resumed in 1974 by Geraldine C. Gesell (University of Tennessee) and Leslie Preston Day (College of Wooster; later, Wabash College), who visited Vronda as part of an informal survey of sites in the area. In 1978, Gesell and Day were joined by William D.E. Coulson (University of Minnesota; later, American School of Classical Studies at Athens) to establish the Kavousi Project, which began with mapping of the site, a study of material found by Boyd and Sekadakis and housed in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum and the Archaeological Collection of Ierapetra (1979), cleaning of the tholos tombs (1981), a <b>topographical</b> <b>plan,</b> cleaning and drawing of architectural remains on the Vronda ridge (1983-1984), and two study seasons (1985-1986). Full-scale excavations under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Archaeological Service, and with permission from the Greek Ministry of Culture, were conducted from 1987-1990 and in 1992, followed by site conservation from 1993 to 1996, and study from 1990 to 2003. Today, select antiquities discovered by the Kavousi Project at Vronda are on display in the Archaeological Museum of Agios Nikolaos and in the Archaeological Collection of Ierapetra. Other artifacts, excavation notebooks, and original drawings and plans, are housed in the Institute for Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete (INSTAP-SCEC) in Pacheia Ammos in eastern Crete, Greece.|$|E

The Măgura River flows from the massif Great Hill-Hârlău. Before the year 2000 there were 11 lakes, and today are only 4. The purpose of this project is to determine the accuracy of the simple techniques in digital image processing for mapping and monitoring lakes and wetlands. Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS data sets are used. The paper highlights the bands’ thematic classification accuracy using minimum technical and digital (software) resources. The water bodies’ delineated boundaries of each digital classification procedure were compared with the limits obtained by digitizing the <b>topographical</b> <b>plans</b> (1973) and aerial images (2008).

Based on archival information, the author analyzes the circumstances of the underground crypt’s discovery, gives a description of the object. The author found that the crypt in Tsarev belongs to the type of cruciform crypts, located under the above-ground constructions (mausoleums). The constructions of this type have analogies on the territory of the Golden Horde, and in other regions: Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan. For the first time introduced into scientific circulation unique pattern of Golden Horde’s object was investigated by Tereschenko on Tsarev hillfort.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is a {{suitable}} equipment for archiving three-dimensional surface data of any objects. Moreover, aerial LiDAR {{is used for}} the <b>topographical</b> survey, urban <b>planning</b> or forest measurement. On the other hand, ground based LiDAR has a potential for other purposes, such as landslide monitoring or landcover change monitoring. This paper reports method of landslide and landcover monitoring using LiDAR for road management. Firstly, landslide monitoring technique using ground based LiDAR was developed. The amount of movements of a landslide should be precisely measured using LiDAR. In this study, Choja landslide in Japan was measured by LiDAR with a measurement accuracy of 6 mm. The result showed movement of landslide was detected in almost 1 cm accuracy. An intersection point calculation of three surfaces was very effective for the accurate measurement. However, this technique can adapt for artificial object which include a plane. This method should be expand for natural objects such as natural slope or natural cliff. Secondary, landcover change is also detected by ground based LiDAR. A wide area landcover should be classified automatically using LiDAR. The landcover change can be extracted by converting grid model and comparing the elevation of the objects. Vegetated areas are changing seasonally and annually. The land cover change was detected in Choja. The results showed agricultural land could be extracted. Classified trees and Rice fields showed higher accuracy. LiDAR also acquires RGB color information. The classification will improve by using RGB color information in near future...|$|R
2500|$|Around 1907, {{contractor}} Michael Degnon, whose firm {{constructed the}} Williamsburg Bridge, the Cape Cod Canal, and the Steinway subway tunnel (used by today's [...] ), purchased {{large tracts of}} marsh near Flushing Creek. At the time, the land was considered [...] "all but worthless". Degnon envisioned using the site to create a large industrial port around Flushing Bay, similar to a terminal he developed in Long Island City. By 1911, Degnon had created a plan along with the United States Department of War and the Queens <b>Topographical</b> Bureau. The <b>plan</b> envisioned widening Flushing River and creating docks for ships, with numerous factories and freight facilities. Meanwhile, the residential areas of Corona were expected to become the primary residence for factory workers.To create the port, beginning in 1910 Degnon proceeded to fill the land using household coal refuse ashes and street sweepings from Brooklyn. Degnon set up two companies of his own, {{one of which was}} contracted with the New York City Department of Sanitation. He also contracted the Brooklyn Ash Removal Company, owned {{by a member of the}} corrupt Tammany Hall political machine. Residential ash was collected via trolleys of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and loaded onto freight trains which traveled via the Long Island Rail Road branches, or other trolleys, which hauled the refuse to Corona. The operation was referred to as a citywide refuse [...] "conveyor belt", while the trains were nicknamed the [...] "Talcum Powder Express" [...] because they often ran uncovered and deposited soot onto the surroundings. The northern end of the site was filled via now-conventional means, using dirt pumped from Flushing Bay which was being dredged to a lower depth. Material from the bay was extracted by an offshore hydraulic machine, and funneled through a [...] pipe across Northern Boulevard, before being deposited onto the wetlands. The filling for the north meadow was complete in 1916.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{software}} tools for data management can improve site characterization, planning {{and execution of}} remediation projects. This paper discusses the use of two such products that have primarily been used within the nuclear power industry to enhance the capabilities of radiation protection department operations. Advances in digital imaging, web application development and programming technologies have made development of these tools possible. The Interactive Visual Tour System (IVTS) allows the user to easily create and maintain a comprehensive catalog containing digital pictures of the remediation site. Pictures can be cataloged in groups (termed ''tours'') that can be organized either chronologically or spatially. Spatial organization enables the user to ''walk around'' the site and view desired areas or components instantly. Each photo is linked to a map (floor <b>plan,</b> <b>topographical</b> map, elevation drawing, etc.) with graphics displaying the location on the map and any available tour/component links. Chronological organization enables the user to view the physical results of the remediation efforts over time. Local and remote management teams can view these pictures {{at any time and}} from any location. The Visual Survey Data System (VSDS) allows users to record survey and sample data directly on photos and/or maps of areas and/or components. As survey information is collected for each area, survey data trends can be reviewed for any repetitively measured location or component. All data is stored in a Quality Assurance (Q/A) records database with reference to its physical sampling point on the site as well as other information to support the final closeout report for the site. The ease of use of these web-based products has allowed nuclear power plant clients to plan outage work from their desktop and realize significant savings with respect to dose and cost. These same tools are invaluable for remediation and decommissioning planning of any scale and for recording of survey data related to building or site decontamination, waste shipments and eventual unrestricted release of entire facilities. This presentation will show the utility of these products in a variety of decontamination, decommissioning and environmental remediation settings including a university research reactor decommissioning project...|$|R
