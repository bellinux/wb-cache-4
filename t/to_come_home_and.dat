25|$|More {{problems}} arise for the newlyweds when Carmel's sister, Maxine (Ella Wilder), announces {{that their parents}} can't cope with Junior and Aisha. She states that if Carmel does not take the children, they will be put into care. Matthew is unwilling but after Carmel's father has a stroke, Maxine brings the children to Carmel so they move in with her and Matthew. He resents them as Carmel's time is being diverted from him; finding Junior, in particular, difficult to cope with. They regularly clash, causing further animosity between Matthew and Carmel and Matthew becomes violent again, punching Carmel during an argument about Junior. She has some nasty bruises but once again a tearful Matthew convinces her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour alternates between contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel loves him and stays with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage but Junior soon realises why his aunt is constantly bruised and tries {{to stop the violence}} by telling people about the abuse but this only makes matters worse. Matthew becomes irrationally jealous of Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal, he turns violent again and attempting to protect Carmel, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife and he is rushed to hospital, where he tries to convince Carmel that he has changed. She allows him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tries to get him professional help but Matthew refuses, appalled by the idea and begins smashing up the house and threatening Carmel with more violence. Finally realising that she cannot help Matthew, Carmel ends their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. The following month, Carmel's father dies, so she leaves Walford with Junior and Aisha to look after her mother. Her last appearance is in August 1989.|$|E

Nell tells Toadie that Mark is {{in bed with}} Sonya, {{resulting}} in an argument during a video chat. Toadie fails to close the chat window properly and Sonya sees him having sex with Dee. Mark then reveals that Dee is actually a woman named Andrea Somers, and Willow is not Toadie's daughter. Sonya's contractions begin and she is rushed to the hospital, where she has a miscarriage.

She is then charged. Attempting to get her life back together, she leaves Erinsborough for rehab, but Toadie soon learns that she has checked herself out. She gives Toadie power of attorney and asks him to sell the nursery to pay Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Toadie finds Sonya in a caravan with a former drinking friend.

500|$|The {{contribution}} to the war made by Southern Rhodesia's white female population generally comprised organising and running donation drives, comforts committees and other similar enterprises. They sent the troops [...] "comforts parcels", which contained balaclavas, mittens and scarves that they had knitted, as well as newspapers, soap, food (including cakes and sweets), and minor luxuries. These packages did much to raise {{the morale of the}} men, particularly those who were in German captivity. Women were also largely responsible for handling mail between Rhodesian soldiers and their relatives and friends back home. After the armistice, they organised financial assistance for those discharged Southern Rhodesian men in England who could not afford <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> arranged visits for those convalescing in English hospitals.|$|E

It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book.

Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then {{looks at his watch}} before he can drink the poisoned punch and Pulls Meg out before she can drink Her's, oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as [...] "The Man in White".

500|$|The main {{memorial}} for {{the loss}} of Sydney is located at Geraldton, Western Australia, on top of Mount Scott. Planning for the memorial commenced in late 1997, after a speech by Sydney researcher Glenys McDonald at the local Rotary club. The first, temporary memorial (consisting of a large boulder, a flagpole, and a bronze plaque), was installed prior to 19 November 1998, and was used in a remembrance ceremony that year. During the playing of the Last Post, a large flock of seagulls flew over the participants and headed out to sea in formation: this became a major feature of the permanent memorial. The permanent memorial included four major elements: a stele of the same size and shape of the ship's prow, a granite wall listing the ship's company, a bronze statue of a woman looking out to sea and waiting in vain for the cruiser <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> a dome (dubbed the [...] "dome of souls") onto which 645 stainless steel seagulls were welded. The memorial (minus the stele, which had not been completed in time) was dedicated on 18 November 2001, and was used the next evening for a commemoration ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the ship's loss. In May 2009, the memorial was recognised by the Australian government as being of national significance. By 2011, the stele had been completed, and a fifth element—a pool of remembrance containing a map of the region and the marked position of Sydneys wreck—had been added.|$|E
