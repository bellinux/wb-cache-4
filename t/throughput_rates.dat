Many researches of RS decoder are implemented in parallel architecture, which can perform the highest data <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> in all RS decoder architectures.

The reconfigurable architecture has good flexibility for tradeoff between the data <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> and power consumption. Compared with the DSP type architecture, the proposed reconfigurable architecture can perform higher data <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> with shorter latency.

The process plant throughput-recovery relationship that exists for each ore type can and should be exploited for the purpose of creating additional economic value within the resource plan. This paper investigates the impact on Net Present Value (NPV) of strategic resource plans when allowing a fluctuating process plant <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> over the life of a base metals operation in comparison to only considering a single fixed <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> for a given plant size configuration. The metallurgical throughput-recovery relationship is confirmed as being an important factor in planning the extraction of the resource to feed a given process plant of fixed size since this impacts heavily upon the production schedule and therefore the NPV of the project. Mathematical programming to better aid the decision making process is investigated in comparison to traditional manual approaches to thus help determine the best <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> to use in each period. Results suggest that it would seem reasonable to expect an increase of around 4. 0 % in NPV when allowing a fluctuating process plant <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> over a single fixed <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> over the life of a midsize underground operation when using a mathematical programming approach...|$|R

We describe scheduling algorithms that operate in parallel on each input and output port, and hence are scalable.

However, the corresponding reduction in per-user <b>throughput</b> <b>rate</b> attained under each algorithm becomes much less noticeable with further increases in client population.

Bearing in mind the magnitude of the University of South Africa’s (Unisa’s) market share of accounting students in South Africa, it was pivotal to comprehend the unique challenges related to retention and throughput of these students. This thesis reports on a case study of the use of mobile phones in an Accounting module by applying the theories of didactic conversation and transactional distance to understand the retention and <b>throughput</b> <b>rates</b> of the Accounting students in an open distance learning (ODL) environment. Considering the landscape of accounting education in South Africa, the specific challenges faced by accounting students at Unisa and the recent scholarly discourse on retention and throughput of distance education students, this study contributes to the limited theoretical understanding of students’ retention and <b>throughput</b> <b>rates</b> in an Accounting module at Unisa. This theoretical understanding has been obtained through combining the transactional distance theory of Moore (1973) and the didactic conversation of Holmberg (1982) in a single conceptual framework. By applying this framework, this thesis makes an original contribution to the deepening understanding of the retention and <b>throughput</b> <b>rates</b> of accounting students in an ODL environment. The study has shown that retention and <b>throughput</b> <b>rates</b> can be improved through the lessening of the transactional distance between facilitator and student and by improving the quality and extent of the two-way didactic conversation in the learning process. To this effect, the study provided empirical evidence of the successful use of various complementing technology interventions, suitable for accounting students with time constraints, to enhance the learning process.
