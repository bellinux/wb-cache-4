5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} {{of the game in}} 2006, after having begun work on the core technology, the Hedgehog Engine, in 2005. The title was first brought to public attention when <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Unleashed name was trademarked by Sega on March 12, 2008. Screenshots of cut scenes, artwork, and a video were leaked ten days later, with the title then officially confirmed by Sega on April 3, 2008 with a small selection of screenshots and an updated video. The game was developed internally by Sonic Team in Japan. It was originally intended to be the third installment of <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Adventure series and subsequently, at an early development stage, had the working title Sonic World Adventure, complete with work-in-progress logo. However, the development team began to introduce enough new innovations to separate it from <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Adventure titles, and so a new title, Sonic Unleashed, was decided upon. It was then later revealed that the game's name in Japan would in fact remain Sonic World Adventure for its release there.|$|E

5|$|Chao have {{appeared}} in many games in the series, beginning with Sonic Adventure in 1998. They usually {{take the form of}} digital pets, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character Cream the Rabbit has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog comics, and <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> X anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into Sonic gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{characters}} in <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> series, Amy can run at superhuman speeds {{but not as}} fast as Sonic. She attacks foes with her ever-present signature weapon, the Piko-Piko Hammer, with which she is very proficient. She also has other minor skills such as tarot card reading and dowsing.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sonic</b> X-treme debacle {{has been}} cited {{as a reason for}} the {{ultimate}} failure of the Sega Saturn. With <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog series being attributed to much {{of the success of the}} company's prior system, the Genesis, and Sony and Nintendo both having flagship 3D platformers available early in the life cycle of their consoles (Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, respectively), Sega was expected by fans to follow suit and produce an official 3D Sonic game. With the game's cancellation, the Saturn never did receive an exclusive Sonic platform game, but rather only the Genesis port of Sonic 3D Blast; Sonic Jam, a compilation of the 2D Genesis Sonic titles; and Sonic R, a racing game. Sonic's debut in a full 3D platform game was not until 1998, with Sonic Adventure as a Dreamcast launch title, well after the discontinuation of the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{popularity}} {{inspired a}} number of unofficial variants as well, including Somari, a pirated Nintendo Entertainment System conversion of the game featuring Nintendo's Mario character in levels from the original Sonic game, Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix, a total conversion mod of the original game, and Sonic 1 Boomed, a ROM hack which implements Sonic's redesign from <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Boom animated series.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sonics</b> pair of {{trades at}} the trade {{deadline}} 2003 effectively ended Sesayâ€™s season. He {{was placed on}} the injured list with a lower back strain and remained there for the rest of <b>the</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>Sonics</b> missed his versatility during that period. In addition to the three positions mentioned above, <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> coaching staff also discussed playing Sesay at the point when backup Kenny Anderson was injured during {{the early part of the}} 2002-2003 season.|$|R
5|$|According to Roger Hector, vice {{president}} and general manager of Sega Technical Institute, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before <b>the</b> release of <b>Sonic</b> & Knuckles, between <b>the</b> releases of <b>Sonic</b> <b>the</b> Hedgehog and <b>Sonic</b> <b>the</b> Hedgehog 2. Early development screenshots suggest Knuckles was planned to be playable in <b>the</b> first <b>Sonic</b> <b>the</b> Hedgehog via <b>Sonic</b> & Knuckles lock-on technology, but this feature was removed prior to release.|$|R
5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{debuted in}} <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog manga series created by Kenji Terada in 1992. Her first video-game {{appearance}} was in 1993's Sonic CD {{and she was}} first playable in 1994's Sonic Drift. Amy {{has become one of}} the series' most popular and recognizable characters, appearing in dozens of main-series and spinoff titles, several comic book series, the anime Sonic X, and the computer-animated Sonic Boom. She has received an average response from critics. Although some found her cute and powerful, others criticized her for her voice acting and personality. She has frequently appeared in Sonic merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{is a major}} {{character}} in <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog manga. She is the girlfriend of protagonist Nicky, whose alter ego is Sonic, and is unaware that they are identical. Antagonist Anton Brooke is also attracted to her; he kidnaps her a number of times, forcing Nicky to become Sonic and rescue her. In Sonic Adventures, a 1994 two-issue French comic book published by SirÃ¨ne, Doctor Robotnik (Eggman) uses Amy as bait to lure Sonic. When Sonic, Amy and Tails fall into a pit of lava, they are saved by a giant ring which transports them to a different location.|$|E

5000|$|The 2003-04 NBA {{season was}} the SuperSonics' 37th {{season in the}} National Basketball Association. <b>The</b> <b>Sonics</b> started <b>the</b> season in Tokyo, Japan with a two game series against the Los Angeles Clippers. <b>The</b> <b>Sonics</b> {{got off to a}} 5-1 start, but played around [...]500 {{for the first half of}} the season. Ray Allen played his first full season as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> after being {{acquired}} from the Milwaukee Bucks in a trade last February. Despite missing the first 25 games due to an ankle injury, he was voted to play in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game. This was Allen's fourth overall All-Star Game appearance and his first as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Sonics.</b> However, despite a 7-game winning streak in March, <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> lost seven of their final ten games ending the season fifth in the Pacific Division with a 37-45 record, missing the playoffs. Following the season, Brent Barry signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs.|$|R
5|$|Archie Comics, {{publisher}} of the main Sonic the Hedgehog comics, started a Sonic X series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released on January 1, 2009, and led into the first arc of <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> Universe series. The comics were written by Ian Flynn, who also authors the main comic series. Some issues were published in Jetix Magazine in the United Kingdom and Italy.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the unique}} motion-based {{gameplay}} mechanics, the Wii version of the game also supports the GameCube controller, and also the option of using the Classic Controller. The daytime levels for the Wii were altered to accommodate the motion control-based boost mechanic, while night-time levels include a mostly behind-the-back view and different platforming styles and combat mechanics. Developer Dimps, who had past involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> franchise, {{was involved in the}} design of the daytime areas for these versions. In addition, overall, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions have fewer daytime levels than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of <b>the</b> <b>Sonic</b> series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except {{for a brief period}} through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
50|$|In {{its best}} known incarnation, garage-rock protopunkers, <b>The</b> <b>Sonics,</b> covered <b>the</b> song on their 1965 album, Here Are <b>The</b> <b>Sonics.</b> Driven by haphazardly {{recorded}} fuzz guitar, a big driving drum sound, screaming vocals and a dirty saxophone break, it epitomized their sound at that time. <b>The</b> <b>Sonics</b> changed <b>the</b> chord progression {{from the original}} G-Am-Bb-Am, a 1-2m-m3-2m progression, to a basic 1-4-5-4 progression, which in G would be simply G-C-D-C. This is the version that virtually all other artists copied.|$|R
25|$|The NBA {{threatened}} to disallow the contract and impose sanctions against <b>the</b> <b>Sonics.</b> Haywood responded by filing an antitrust {{suit against the}} league, seeking an injunction to prevent the NBA from disallowing the contract or punishing <b>the</b> <b>Sonics.</b> <b>The</b> case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which issued a 7â€“2 decision in Haywood's favor in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Both teams {{made it back}} to {{the finals}} the {{following}} season, with the Bullets holding home court advantage. That season the Bullets won 54 games while <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> won 52. <b>The</b> Bullets eliminated the Atlanta Hawks (4-3) and San Antonio Spurs (4-3) to advance while <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> eliminated <b>the</b> Los Angeles Lakers (4-1) and the Phoenix Suns (4-3). The Bullets appeared to have momentum with a Game 1 victory at the Capital Centre, but <b>the</b> <b>Sonics</b> took <b>the</b> next four games to win their only NBA championship.|$|R
