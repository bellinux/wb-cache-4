5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016.

30|$|As we have shown, the {{theoretical}} distribution of IAIs {{can be calculated}} by assessing periods of consecutive active <b>to</b> quiescent <b>transitions</b> and single quiescent <b>to</b> active <b>transitions.</b> It is also possible to derive the distribution of consecutive quiescent <b>to</b> active <b>transitions.</b> However, if a period of active <b>to</b> quiescent <b>transitions</b> (a period without firing) has a duration less than the average time difference between two spikes then this interval does not separate an avalanche into two. Therefore, the distributions of number and length of consecutive quiescent <b>to</b> active <b>transitions</b> does not describe the distributions of avalanche size and duration—these distributions can also contain periods of active <b>to</b> quiescent <b>transitions</b> within two or more periods of quiescent <b>to</b> active <b>transitions.</b> Note that a period of active <b>to</b> quiescent <b>transitions</b> having a length less than the average difference between consecutive spikes is not dependent {{on the number of}} active <b>to</b> quiescent <b>transitions</b> within the interval, as the length of each transition is drawn at random from an exponential distribution. It was therefore not possible for us to determine a theoretical distribution of avalanche size and duration using this approach.|$|R

In return, the masters will cease their support of the Sons of the Harpy. As the masters deliberate, Tyrion is confronted by the former slaves of Meereen, who oppose any kind of negotiation with the masters. Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that the masters, whom they are both familiar with, will use him if he tries to use them.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm <b>to</b> <b>transition</b> into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Otto {{produced}} days of torrential rain {{over much}} of the northeastern Caribbean in October2010. Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering north of Puerto Rico on October6, and transitioned into a tropical storm the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale on October8, attaining peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible surroundings and became extratropical west of the Azores on October10. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone on record <b>to</b> <b>transition</b> from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008.|$|E
