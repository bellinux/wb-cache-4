5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door.

5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings.

5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled.

500|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. <b>The</b> cold and <b>warm</b> fronts curve naturally poleward into {{the point of}} occlusion, which {{is also known as}} the triple point.

5|$|The Atlantic Heat Piracy model {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} oceanic circulation cause one hemisphere's oceans to become warmer at the other's expense (Seidov and Maslin 2001). Currently, the Gulf Stream redirects warm, equatorial waters towards the northern Nordic Seas. The addition of fresh water to northern oceans may reduce {{the strength of the}} Gulf stream, and allow a southwards current to develop instead. This would cause the cooling of the northern hemisphere, and <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> of the southern, causing changes in ice accumulation and melting rates and possibly triggering shelf destruction and Heinrich events (Stocker 1998).|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E

Data for this study consists of aircraft data averaged over one minute supplimented by satellite and drifting buoy observations. Analysis of surface winds and fluxes was done using the Brown-Liu Marine PBL model. Results show a PBL which differs from that found in typical cyclones, with large latent heat fluxes south of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and with relatively weak sensible heat fluxes about <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front. Boundary layer stratification was stable north of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and unstable south of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front.
