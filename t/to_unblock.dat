25|$|Organisation: {{following}} the thrombotic event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an occlusive thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel {{that leads to}} complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity <b>to</b> <b>unblock</b> the lumen. For a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen {{rather than by the}} vasa vasorum.|$|E

25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if they value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN <b>to</b> <b>unblock</b> websites that are blocked.|$|E

2500|$|Emotional {{education}} trumped intellectual needs, in Neill's eyes, and he {{was associated}} with anti-intellectualism. In actuality, he had a personal interest in scholarship and used his autobiography {{near the end of}} his life to profess the necessity of both emotion and intellect in education, though he often took jabs at what he saw to be education's overemphasis on book-learning. Neill felt that an emotional education freed the intellect to follow what it pleased, and that children required an emotional education to keep up with their own gradual developmental needs. This education usually entailed copious amounts of play and distance from the adult anxieties of work and ambition. Neill was influenced by Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis, Homer Lane's interpretation of Freud, and later, by the unorthodox sexual theories of Wilhelm Reich. The reverence for Reich appears in the abundant correspondence between them. [...] Neill accepted Reich's claims about cosmic energy and his utopian ideas on human sexuality. In Reich's view, [...] "discharge" [...] of sexual energy leads to happiness, whereas lack of such discharge leads to unhappiness and [...] "rigidity". Although not a trained therapist, Neill gave psychoanalytic private lessons to individual children, designed <b>to</b> <b>unblock</b> impasses in their inner energies. Neill also offered body massage, as suggested by Reich. Neill later found that freedom cured better than this therapy.|$|E

PAA induced similar levels to that obtained with lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma. NO production by adherent cells was significantly lower than that of unfractionated cells, suggesting a combination of lectin stimuli directly on macrophages and via lymphocyte stimulation. Ex vivo experiments showed that cells stimulated in vivo could maintain NO production in vitro without further stimuli.

The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about [...] "all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, [...] "Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides <b>to</b> <b>unblock</b> it then that's what we will do." [...] The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammad Day—May 20". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] event as [...] "blasphemous". Siddique told The Times, [...] "The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held." [...] The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, {{it would be difficult to}} stop the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a temporary block on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010.|$|E

40|$|A {{new family}} of boron {{cross-linked}} graphene oxide/polyvinyl alcohol (GO-B-PVA) nanocomposite gels is prepared by freeze-thaw/boron cross-linking method. Then the gel electrolytes saturated with KOH solution are assembled into {{electric double layer}} capacitors (EDLCs). Structure, thermal and mechanical properties of GO-B-PVA are explored. The electrochemical properties of EDLCs using GO-B-PVA/KOH are investigated, and compared with those using GO-PVA/KOH gel or KOH solution electrolyte. FTIR shows that boron cross-links are introduced into GO-PVA, while the boronic structure inserted into agglomerated GO sheets is demonstrated by DMA analysis.

40|$|Objectives: Adhesions {{around the}} flexor tendons block tendon gliding. The most common problem in {{secondary}} surgery is inadequate and ineffective tenolysis. Local anesthesia facilitates patient comfort and early active mobilization, {{which is very}} important after tenolysis surgery and even surgery without tourniquet. This study presents a tenolysis series managed with local anesthesia. Methods: We performed 22 tenolysis surgeries for zone 1 and zone 2 tendon adhesions under local infiltration anesthesia. If active flexion was achieved due <b>to</b> <b>unblocked</b> motor function, we removed the screen between the surgery area and patient to allow the patient to view their own movement. Results: There was 1 relapse. However, {{the results of the}} remaining patients were good or excellent.
