5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles.

5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly in human life, had been worth fighting. Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> that the pageantry was designed to distract from the poor living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kỳ {{disapproved of}} Chuan's {{approach}} and replaced Chuan with Đính. Prime Minister Kỳ felt Đính's aggressive attitude following the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in 1963 indicated {{a willingness to}} suppress Buddhist dissidents. Moreover, Đính {{was a native of}} central Vietnam and would have been popular with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> along parochial lines. Đính arrived in Huế on 15 April and, after a week, announced that he had restored Saigon's authority over the region. He proclaimed that he had regained control of the radio stations in Đà Nẵng and Huế from the dissidents, and that he had convinced the mayor of Đà Nẵng to remain loyal to Saigon. Đính announced a deal whereby the Buddhists would have regular air time in return for relinquishing control of the radio station. This move was interpreted in different ways. Some felt that Đính was attempting to gain favour with the Buddhists in anticipation of Kỳ's fall from power, while Frances FitzGerald felt it was the only sensible government action during the crisis. On 19 April, clashes erupted in Quảng Ngãi between the Buddhists and the VNQDĐ (Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which supported the continuation of the anti-communist war, prompting Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> they would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} thought {{suppression}} and its effectiveness to be studied, researchers {{have had to}} find methods of recording the processes {{going on in the}} mind. One experiment designed with this purpose was performed by Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White. They asked participants to avoid thinking of a specific target (e.g. a white bear) for five minutes, but if they did, they were told then to ring a bell. After this, participants were told that for the next five minutes they were to think about the target. There was evidence that unwanted thoughts occurred more frequently in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> used <b>thought</b> suppression compared to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were not. Furthermore, there was also evidence that during the second stage, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had used <b>thought</b> suppression had a higher frequency of target <b>thoughts</b> than did <b>those</b> <b>who</b> hadn't used <b>thought</b> suppression; later coined the rebound effect. This effect has been replicated and can even be done with implausible targets, such as the thought of a [...] "green rabbit". From these implications, Wegner eventually developed the [...] "ironic process theory".|$|R

25|$|When the Eastern State Penitentiary, or Cherry Hill as it {{was known}} at the time, was erected in 1829 in Francisville (the idea of this new prison was created in a meeting held at Benjamin Franklin's house in 1787) {{it was the largest}} and most {{expensive}} public structure in the country. Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect John Haviland was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland. He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> of committing a crime.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four.

Nevertheless, BBC Radio 1 received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on Pete Drummond's show on 3 May. Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of Baba's spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradicting details.|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{enjoyed a}} revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino's {{sequential}} Kill Bill [...] movies, in 2003 and 2004.

[...] Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper each had Kill Bill Vol. 2 on their top ten list for of Academy Awards predictions. Although the films received no notice from the Academy, Carradine did receive a Golden Globe nomination and a Saturn Award, for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bill.|$|E

[...] <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely.

She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted Sylvia Pankhurst—the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPU—to describe her as [...] "one of the most daring and reckless of the militants". In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from Caxton Hall to see the prime minister, H. H.

[...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] {{can be a problem}} for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E
