5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% {{of the land in}} the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E
25|$|After {{two other}} black deserters were {{captured}} and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt {{announced he would}} stop executing captured deserters. As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|The only {{theory to}} vary greatly from <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Bailey Willis, Carl E. Grunsky and his son. They {{believed}} that {{the portion of the}} east abutment below the dam was the first to give way, clearing the way for the collapse to take place.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} street running through Newcastle {{at the time}} was Pilgrim Street, running northwards inside the walls and leading to the Pilgrim Gate on the north wall. The street still exists today and there are different explanations for its name. One is that pilgrims passed through Newcastle on the way to visit St Mary's Chapel in Jesmond. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the friary of Greyfriars, next to Pilgrim Street, had holy relics of St Francis, the founder of the order, and pilgrims passed up Pilgrim Street to visit them.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E

The burial contains the remains of two or possibly three individuals.

25|$|One {{reason that}} the ancients treated the {{parallel}} postulate as less certain than <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.|$|R

25|$|Some sources also {{claim that}} the Indo-Greeks may have reached the Shunga capital Pataliputra in northeastern India. However, {{the nature of this}} {{expedition}} is a matter of controversy. One theory is that Indo-Greeks were invited to join a raid led by local Indian kings down the Ganges river. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was a campaign likely made by Menander. Irrespective it appears that Pataliputra, if at all captured, was not held for long as the expedition was forced to retreat, probably due to wars in their own territories. Menander's reign saw the end of the Indo-Greek expansion.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 {{report of}} the Belgian Senate stated {{that there was not}} enough {{information}} to determine specifics about the assassination. A 1998 report by the National Assembly of France posited two probable explanations. One is that the attack was carried out by groups of Hutu extremists, distressed by the advancement of negotiations with the RPF, the political and military adversary of the current regime, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was the responsibility of the RPF, frustrated at the lack of progress in the Arusha Accords. Among the other hypotheses that were examined is one that implicates the French military, although there is no clear motive for a French attack on the Rwandan government. The 1998 French report made no determination between the two dominant theories. A 2000 report by the Organisation of African Unity does not attempt to determine responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Marvel/DC Crossovers - In the {{majority}} of Marvel/DC crossovers, Superman is from the same universe as many Marvel characters, as in an Elseworlds story. In JLA/Avengers, which depicts the DC and Marvel Universes being attacked and forcibly combined by Krona, Superman and Captain America are mentally affected by the universal upheaval and become disgusted with each other's methods; Superman views the Marvel Universe's heroes as disgraces who have let their world down through inaction, while Captain America views the Justice League as overlords who oppress the people of their world. The two eventually reconcile and admit {{that part of the}} reason they resented <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they fear their accusations are right, with Superman being temporarily entrusted with Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer Mjolnir during the final fight against the minions of their greatest foe, Krona.|$|E

500|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can be used}} {{to create}} a phylogenetic tree. [...] This is made possible by two reasons. The first is because functional domains that are known in annotated sequences can be used for alignment in non-annotated sequences. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> conserved regions known to be functionally important can be found. This makes it possible for multiple sequence alignments to be used to analyze and find evolutionary relationships through homology between sequences. Point mutations and insertion or deletion events (called indels) can be detected.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} entitled We Are Mongrels, but the title {{had to be}} changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy show, We Are Klang. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> none of the characters were mongrels. Therefore, new suggestions were called for. Rejected titles included I, Nelson; Humans! Everywhere!; Undergrowth and Never Been Stroked.

[...] During this time the crew referred to the show as Mongrels and it eventually became the show's title.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{is made of}} the word's two {{spelling}}s: {{whiskey and}} whisky. There are two schools of thought on the issue.
