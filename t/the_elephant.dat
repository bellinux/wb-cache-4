50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Elephant’s</b> Child {{gets closer}} the Crocodile grabs him {{and tries to}} eat him. The Kolokolo Bird appears on a branch and, though scared, flies/falls to the ground to save <b>the</b> <b>Elephant’s</b> Child. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>Elephant’s</b> Child pulls free and the Crocodile slinks back into <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>Elephant’s</b> Child is embarrassed to see that his nose has been pulled into a trunk. The Kolokolo Bird {{encourages}} him to {{look on the bright}} side of having such a long nose and <b>the</b> <b>Elephant’s</b> Child apologizes for being so rude.|$|R
60|$|So he pulled, and <b>the</b> <b>Elephant's</b> Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled; but <b>the</b> <b>Elephant's</b> Child and <b>the</b> Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at {{last the}} Crocodile let go of <b>the</b> <b>Elephant's</b> Child's nose with a plop that you could hear {{all up and down}} the Limpopo.|$|R
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet. Merrick {{was able to put}} his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own. The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E
50|$|India {{has several}} {{mountains}} with fruit trees of every kind. There {{are a large}} number of animal species in India. <b>The</b> Indian <b>elephants</b> are far stronger than <b>the</b> Libyan <b>elephants,</b> because of <b>the</b> abundance of food on the Indian soil. <b>The</b> <b>elephants</b> are domesticated in large numbers, and trained for war. The gestation period of <b>the</b> <b>elephants</b> ranges from 16 to 18 months, and the oldest of <b>the</b> <b>elephants</b> live up to 200 years.|$|R

5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> in the room, {{is a large}} elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near <b>the</b> <b>elephant</b> {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. <b>The</b> <b>elephant</b> serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E

5|$|Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's {{life story}} {{became the basis}} of several works of {{dramatic}} art; these {{were based on the}} accounts of Treves and Montagu. In 1979, a Tony Award-winning play, <b>The</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man, by American playwright Bernard Pomerance was staged. The character based on Merrick was played by Philip Anglim, and later by David Bowie and Mark Hamill. In 1980, a film <b>The</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man, directed by David Lynch, was released; it received eight Academy Award nominations. Merrick was played by John Hurt and Frederick Treves by Anthony Hopkins. In 1982, US television network ABC broadcast an adaptation of Pomerance's play, starring Anglim.|$|E

60|$|The Romans stood most {{in awe of}} <b>the</b> <b>elephants,</b> {{and they}} resorted to some {{peculiar}} and extraordinary means of resisting them. They prepared {{a great number of}} chariots, each of which was armed with a long pointed spear, projecting forward in such a manner that when the chariots should be driven on toward <b>the</b> <b>elephants,</b> these spears or beaks should pierce the bodies of the beasts and destroy them. The chariots, too, were filled with men, who were all provided with fire-brands, which they were to throw at <b>the</b> <b>elephants,</b> and frighten them, as they came on. These chariots were all carefully posted in front of that part of Pyrrhus's army where <b>the</b> <b>elephants</b> were stationed, and the charioteers were strictly ordered not to move until they should see <b>the</b> <b>elephants</b> advancing.|$|R

Bart chooses <b>the</b> <b>elephant.</b> This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of <b>the</b> <b>elephant,</b> or lose their jobs.

5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt the pup or pups of another.

5|$|In 2014, Cooper {{received}} two nominations {{for his role}} as Rocket in the superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy. Later that year, he starred in and co-produced the biographical war film American Sniper. Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award and MTV Movie Award for Best Actor, and an Academy Award for Best Picture. With these nominations, Cooper became only the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Although Cooper's roles in the 2015 films Aloha and Joy earned him two additional nominations, his performance as the severely deformed Joseph Merrick in the Broadway revival <b>The</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man garnered more recognition. His performance in <b>The</b> <b>Elephant</b> Man landed him four nominations, including a nod for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E
