30|$|By {{combining}} the calculated susceptibility value and vulnerability value (Fig.  1), a <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> is given for a target expressway section. In {{the table of}} severity rating shown in the chart of <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> (Fig.  1), the x-axis and y-axis indicate the vulnerability value and susceptibility value, respectively. Through investigations on past debris-flow occurrences, the <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> were categorized according to the rainfall recurrence period for expressway design purposes. <b>Hazard</b> <b>class</b> S indicates a likelihood of debris-flow occurrences in areas with rainfall recurrence periods of 2 – 5  years. <b>Hazard</b> <b>classes</b> A, B, C, and D have rainfall recurrence periods of 5 – 20, 20 – 50, 50 – 100  years, and over 100  years, respectively. <b>Hazard</b> <b>class</b> E indicates an area with a very low likelihood of debris-flow damage (Korea Expressway Corporation 2009).|$|R
40|$|Among {{hazardous}} materials {{those which are}} most dangerous fall into three categories: chemical, biological, and radioactive. The DOT <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> for these three categories are <b>Hazard</b> <b>Class</b> 2. 3 (poisonous gases) and 6. 1 (toxic substances) for chemical <b>hazards,</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Class</b> 6. 2 (infectious substances) for biological <b>hazards</b> and <b>Hazard</b> <b>Class</b> 7 for radioactive material (RAM) hazards.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the new Slovenian methodology for determining hazard areas and the classification of land parcels into <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> due to land slides and rock falls, a pilot project was carried out on the regional road between Bovec and Vr{i~ pass in theTrenta valley. For this around 20 km long road in a typical alpine environment, a hazard assessment of falling rocks was carried out, even tough the road also passes through snow avalanches hazard areas. The performed hazard assessment of falling rocks is based onan expert knowledge taking into account the field mapping, and classifies the road into three hazard classes: 9811 m is classified into the low <b>hazard</b> <b>class,</b> 7233 m is classifiedinto the medium <b>hazard</b> <b>class,</b> and 1301 m is classified into high <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> of falling rocks...|$|R

Since exponential, Weibull, generalized exponential, Rayleigh, Burr type X, exponentiated Weibull belong to the proportional (reversed) <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> of distributions, therefore the present results will provide characterizations of all these special cases...|$|R
50|$|United Nations {{markings}} include numbered <b>Hazard</b> <b>Class</b> and Division (HC/D) {{codes and}} alphabetic Compatibility Group codes. Though {{the two are}} related, they are separate and distinct. Any Compatibility Group designator can be assigned to any <b>Hazard</b> <b>Class</b> and Division. An example of this hybrid marking would be a consumer firework, which is labeled as 1.4G or 1.4S.|$|R
50|$|Associated {{with each}} UN number is a hazard identifier, which encodes the general <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> and {{subdivision}} (and, {{in the case}} of explosives, their compatibility group). If a substance poses several dangers, then subsidiary risk identifiers may be specified. It is not possible to deduce the <b>hazard</b> <b>class(es)</b> of a substance from its UN number: they have to be looked up in a table.|$|R
5000|$|Aspiration hazard {{includes}} severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, {{varying degrees}} of pulmonary injury or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system. Substances and mixtures of this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are {{assigned to one of}} two hazard categories this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> on the basis of viscosity.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to use a battery of biotests {{composed}} of producers (Selenastrum capricornutum, Sorghum saccharatum, Lepidium sativum, and Sinapis alba), consumers (Thamnocephalus platyurus), and decomposers (Tetrahymena thermophila) to evaluate the toxicity of snowmelt and winter storm water samples. The toxicity of the samples collected in the winter period December to February (2010 – 2011), in one of the largest agglomerations in Poland, the city of Lodz, was compared to that of storm water samples taken under similar conditions in June. The most toxic snowmelt samples were found to be high acute <b>hazard</b> (<b>class</b> IV), while the remaining samples were rated as slight acute <b>hazard</b> (<b>class</b> II). L. sativum (in the Phytotox test) was the most sensitive test organism, giving 27 % of all toxic responses, followed by S. capricornutum with 23 % of all responses. T. thermophila was the least sensitive, with only 2 % of all toxic responses. The greatest range of toxicity was demonstrated by samples from the single family house catchment: no acute <b>hazard</b> (<b>class</b> I) to high acute <b>hazard</b> (<b>class</b> IV...|$|R

5000|$|A {{flammable}} liquid is a liquid with a flash point of {{not more than}} 93 °C. Substances and mixtures of this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are {{assigned to one of}} four hazard categories {{on the basis of the}} flash point and boiling point. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.|$|R
5000|$|Reactivity hazards are {{assessed}} using the OSHA criterion of physical hazard. Seven such <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> are recognized:Water Reactives, Organic Peroxides, Explosives, Compressed gases, Pyrophoric materials, Oxidizers, and Unstable Reactives.|$|R

30|$|The {{severity}} {{levels of}} debris flow {{were defined as}} three levels: safe, caution, and warning (Fig.  1). If the measured rainfall datasets do not correspond to all three cases of accumulated rainfall datasets, the target expressway section is considered as safe from debris-flow hazard. If more than one indicator exceeds the three baseline rainfalls {{with regard to the}} five <b>hazard</b> <b>classes,</b> the debris-flow <b>hazard</b> needs to be forecast as a level of caution or warning. The criteria are appropriate for conservative risk management because of the cross validation between rainfall datasets and <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> in the case of actual damage status on the representative nine expressway sections (see Sect.  5.2). The quantified rainfall criteria for the <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> of debris flow create difficulties for real-time management of debris-flow hazard on the national expressway, although it is desirable to apply the probability of the possible rainfall recurrence period (Choi et al. 2015). Therefore, simulations using relationships between recurrence period and accumulated rainfall data at locations where debris flows have occurred is required to establish the appropriate rainfall criteria for debris-flow risk assessment.|$|R
50|$|Substances or {{articles}} {{are assigned to}} 9 different <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> largely based on the United Nations Dangerous Goods System. Additions and changes have been necessary since {{the scope of the}} GHS includes all target audiences.|$|R

5000|$|Specific {{target organ}} {{toxicity}} (STOT) [...] category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for Target Organ Effects. All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically {{included in the}} GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed {{are included in the}} non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure. Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are assigned to one of three hazard categories. Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are assigned to one of two hazard categories.|$|R

5000|$|GHS hazard statement: Standard phrases {{assigned}} to a <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> and category that describe {{the nature of the}} hazard. An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard.|$|R
5000|$|Germ cell {{mutagenicity}} {{means an}} agent {{giving rise to}} an increased occurrence of mutations in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are {{assigned to one of}} two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.|$|R
5000|$|Skin {{sensitizer}} means {{a substance}} that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for [...] "skin [...] " [...] is equivalent to [...] "contact sensitizer". Substances and mixtures in this <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are assigned to one hazard category.|$|R
40|$|When certain {{hazardous}} {{chemicals are}} stored or mixed together, violent reactions may occur because the chemicals are unsuitable for mixing, or are incompatible. Classes of incompatible chemicals should be segregated {{from each other}} during storage, according to <b>hazard</b> <b>class.</b> Refer to the suggested shelf storage patterns for guidance. No single method of determining chemical compatibility is perfect. The reasons for this are varied and include: • Many chemicals belong {{to more than one}} <b>hazard</b> <b>class.</b> This can lead to confusion as to which class is appropriate for the chemical in question. Examples: Nitric acid is both an acid and an oxidizer; Benzoyl chloride is a combustible liquid, a corrosive, and a lachrymator. • The <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> that is most important can change depending on factors such as quantity of material, and other chemicals in the storage area. • Not all chemicals in a given class are compatible. For example, sodium dichloroisocyanurate and calcium hypochlorite are both oxidizers and belong to no other class of chemical, yet the mixing of these two materials can lead to the formation of nitrogen trichloride, a shock sensitive explosive...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} possibilities of incorporating and visualising uncertainties in natural hazard maps. Including uncertainties associated with prediction maps of future natural hazards such as mass movements, floods, and avalanches might increase the usefulness of natural hazard prediction map to decision makers in land-use planning. Today hazard prediction maps are usually created by applying a bivariate hazard matrix (magnitude-frequency diagram) to transfer hazard analyses results {{into a number of}} classes (e. g. 10 in Switzerland). Each class represents a certain magnitude and likelihood of occurrence of a hazardous process. The <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> are then applied to the study area which will then be divided into discrete zones. To a certain degree this approach already accounts for the uncertainties inherent in the analysis of natural hazards as it presents its outputs in ranges and not in absolute values. However, a user of this map product might want to know how valid and reliable boundaries between the displayed <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> are. In the conventional way of representation these suggest a sharp and sudden change in magnitude-frequency although the transition might be rather continuous and furthermore they are subject to uncertainties. Also, areas inside a <b>hazard</b> <b>class</b> are not homogeneous a...|$|R
