And considering, John, {{that the}} house is too large, and perhaps <b>too</b> <b>lonely,</b> <b>to</b> be kept well in hand by Bottles, you, and me, I propose that we cast about among our friends for a certain selected number of the most reliable and willing--form a Society here for three months--wait upon ourselves and one another--live cheerfully and socially--and see what happens." ...|$|E
60|$|Normanstand was now <b>too</b> utterly <b>lonely</b> <b>to</b> be endurable; so Stephen {{determined}} to go, {{for a time}} at any rate, to Lannoy. She was becoming accustomed to be called 'my lady' and 'your ladyship,' and the new loneness made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new surroundings.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of her reveries and rhapsodies, tidings reached Newstead of the {{untimely}} death of Lord Byron. How they were received by this humble but passionate devotee I could not ascertain; her life was <b>too</b> obscure and <b>lonely</b> <b>to</b> furnish much personal anecdote, but among her poetical effusions are several written in a broken and irregular manner, and evidently under great agitation.|$|R

60|$|And {{the little}} tanoki saw it all, and rejoiced that his mother's death had been avenged. Then {{he went back}} to the forest, and if he has not found it <b>too</b> <b>lonely,</b> he is {{probably}} living there still.|$|R

60|$|Naturally {{a man in}} this {{attitude}} will see many traits of animal life which are hidden from the game-killer {{as well as from}} the scientific collector of skins. For instance, practically all wild animals are shy and timid and run away at man's approach. This is the general experience not only of hunters but of casual observers in the woods. Yet my own experience has many times shown me exactly the opposite trait: that when these same shy animals find me unexpectedly close at hand, more than half the time they show no fear whatever but only an eager curiosity to know who and what the creature is that sits so quietly near them. Sometimes, indeed, they seem almost to understand the mental attitude which has no thought of harm but only of sympathy and friendly interest. Once I was followed for hours by a young wolf which acted precisely like a lost dog, too timid to approach and <b>too</b> curious or <b>lonely</b> <b>to</b> run away. He even wagged his tail when I called to him softly. Had I shot him on sight, I would probably have foolishly believed that he intended to attack me when he came trotting along my trail. Three separate times I have touched a wild deer with my hand; once I touched a moose, once an eagle, once a bear; and a score of times at least I have had to frighten these big animals or get out of their way, when their curiosity brought them too near for perfect comfort.|$|R

You're <b>too</b> <b>lonely,</b> sir. When you're in trouble, it's some help--though not much--to shift a share of it off on another person's shoulders. If your good lady had only been alive now, sir, what a comfort you would have found her, wouldn't you?" ...|$|R

50|$|The {{organized}} {{version of}} Christian cenobitic monasticism is commonly {{thought to have}} started in Egypt in the 4th century AD. Christian monks of previous centuries were usually hermits, especially in the Middle East; this continued to be very common until the decline of Aramean Christianity in the Late Middle Ages. This form of solitary living, however, did not suit everyone. Some monks found the eremitic style <b>to</b> be <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> and difficult; and if one was not spiritually prepared, the life could lead to mental breakdowns.|$|R
6000|$|Before long, Pedgift Junior looked in, with {{an apology}} for his intrusion. Allan felt <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> and <b>too</b> friendless not to welcome his companion's re-appearance gratefully. [...] "I'm {{not going back to}} Thorpe Ambrose," [...] he said; [...] "I'm going to stay a little while in London. I hope {{you will be able to}} stay with me?" [...] To do him justice, Pedgift was touched by the solitary {{position}} in which the owner of the great Thorpe Ambrose estate now appeared before him. He had never, in his relations with Allan, so entirely forgotten his business interests as he forgot them now.|$|R
60|$|He {{accordingly}} set the phonograph {{at a slow}} pace, and I {{began to}} typewrite {{from the beginning of}} the seventeenth cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients. When he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is. The world seems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it.|$|R

60|$|Although {{this might}} have been a very comical thing to look at from a secure gallery, as a bull-fight is found to be a {{comfortable}} spectacle by those who are not in the arena, and a house on fire is better than a play to people who don't live near it, there was something in the earnestness of Mr Quilp's manner which made his legal adviser feel that the counting-house was a little too small, and a deal <b>too</b> <b>lonely,</b> for the complete enjoyment of these humours. Therefore, he stood as far off as he could, while the dwarf was thus engaged; whimpering out but feeble applause; and when Quilp left off and sat down again from pure exhaustion, approached with more obsequiousness than ever.|$|R

[...] Persson, along with Atomic Swing founder Niclas Frisk and Persson's husband, former Shudder To Think guitarist Nathan Larson, constructed the majority of the backing tracks. [...] "I made Nathan audition," [...] Persson once said jokingly in an interview. The core group of musicians was rounded out by Kevin March, who performed drums on the majority of the album, and whom Nathan had worked with previously as a member of Shudder To Think.|$|R

60|$|But {{how about}} Martin himself? You {{might think that}} with no other child to prattle to and play with or even to see, it was <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> a home for him. Not a bit of it! No child could have been happier. He did not want for company; his playfellows were the dogs and cats and chickens, and any {{creature}} in and about the house. But most of all he loved the little shy creatures that lived in the sunshine among the flowers--the small birds and butterflies, and little beasties and creeping things he was accustomed to see outside the gate among the tall, wild sunflowers. There were acres of these plants, and they were taller than Martin, and covered with flowers no bigger than marigolds, and here among the sunflowers he used {{to spend most of}} the day, as happy as possible.|$|R

60|$|On the contrary, he was leisurely pacing {{in quite}} an {{opposite}} direction, his back {{turned to the}} old mill, and his eyes fixed upon the distant fells, {{which he did not}} care to reach until the gloaming had given way to moonlight. Not that he was afraid of being seen, the road he trod was <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> for that; but he thought it was unlikely his watchings would be rewarded before the night had properly set in. If the beautiful object was a spirit--and what else could it have been?--it would come at its own time, and who ever heard of spirits appearing before midnight? The young fellow, therefore, waited until the moon rose and bathed the hills in her golden flood, when he at once began to climb the fell, making his way up the ravine in which on the previous night he had heard the mysterious voice.|$|R

50|$|After {{her mother}} chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears {{that with all}} the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he {{attempts}} to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For {{much of the rest}} of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling <b>too</b> <b>lonely</b> and afraid.|$|R
