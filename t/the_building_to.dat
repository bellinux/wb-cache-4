5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction to restructure {{the interior of the}} building.

A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|An alternative, space treatment, is fogging or misting to {{disperse}} a liquid insecticide {{in the atmosphere}} within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing, allowing most work within <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>to</b> continue, {{at the cost of}} reduced penetration.

5|$|In 1880, Hooker's {{city hall}} was {{destroyed}} by fire and a new design was commissioned by Henry Richardson; the building opened in 1883.

Architectural critics consider <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>to</b> have been designed around the high point of Richardson's career. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.

He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|R

Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of a courtyard house of which the remainder has disappeared.|$|E
