5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former <b>tidal</b> <b>channel</b> to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E

Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on {{the eastern end of}} Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party that he gave for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated presidential {{campaign}} the year before. Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge (which did not have a guardrail at that time). Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a <b>tidal</b> <b>channel</b> on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of incorporation, Oakland {{consisted}} of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements {{to the east and}} the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and <b>tidal</b> <b>channel</b> in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of Alameda being made an island. In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.|$|E

2500|$|The area {{now known}} as the Daytona Beach Historical District was once the Orange Grove Plantation, a citrus and sugar cane {{plantation}} granted to Samuel Williams in 1787.

Williams was a British loyalist from North Carolina who fled to the Bahamas with his family until the Spanish reopened Florida to non-Spanish immigration. After his death in 1810, the plantation was run by his family until it was burned down in 1835. In 1871, Mathias Day, Jr. of Mansfield, Ohio, purchased the 3,200 acre tract of the former Orange Grove Plantation. He built a hotel around which the initial section of town arose. In 1872, due to financial troubles, Day lost title to his land; nonetheless, residents decided to name the city Daytona in his honor, and incorporated the town in 1876.|$|E

40|$|Vegetation is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important control on flow and landformpatterns inmany landscape types. Field studies on the landscape-scale effect of vegetation in fluvial and tidal floodplains are relatively scarce while insights are especially based on flume and numerical models. Large-scale flow patterns and landforms were measured on a vegetated tidal marsh and unvegetated tidal flat, in particular dynamic changes in twodimensional water surface slopes, flow velocities and directions on an extensive network of locations. It was found that during flooding and drainage of the vegetated tidal marsh, the flow was concentrated in and routed through bare <b>tidal</b> <b>channels,</b> whereas on the unvegetated tidal flat more homogeneous sheet flow occurred. On the marsh the peak flow velocities were lower on the vegetated platform (b 0. 1 m/s) compared to their adjacent <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> (0. 3 - 1 m/s),while on the bare <b>tidal</b> flat the <b>channel</b> and platformflow velocities {{were not significantly different}} from each other (0. 1 - 0. 4 m/s). These differences in flow patterns have important implications for the landform differences between vegetated and bare tidal floodplains: (1) for <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> with channel widths smaller than 10 m, width-to-depth ratios (=ß) were smaller for the <b>tidal</b> marsh <b>channels</b> (ß ~ 3) than for the <b>tidal</b> flat <b>channels</b> (ß ~ 9) (due to flowconcentration towards the channels in the marsh); and (2) the vegetated marsh platform exhibits a clear levee-basin topography (due to vegetation-induced platform flooding from the channels), while there is no levee-basin topography on the bare flat (due to sheet flow). This study not only emphasizes previous findings on the direct effect of vegetation, acting as frictional constraints on flow in tidal marshes, it also suggests that the indirect effect of vegetation, namely its induced micro-topography, influences the flooding and drainage behavior of marsh systems potentially altering feedbacks caused by direct vegetation effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{decade of}} studies of metal and {{nutrient}} inputs to the back-barrier area of Spiekeroog Island, NW German Wadden Sea, have concluded that pore water discharge provides {{a significant source of}} the enrichments of many components measured in the <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> during low tide. In this paper we add studies of radium isotopes to help quantify fluxes into and out of this system. Activities of radium isotopes in surface water from <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> in the back-barrier area exhibit pronounced changes in concert with the tide, with highest activities occurring near low tide. Other dissolved components: silica, alkalinity, manganese, and DOC exhibit similar changes, with patterns matching the Ra isotopes. Uranium follows a reverse pattern with highest concentrations at high tide. Here we use radium isotope measurements in water column and pore water samples to estimate the fluxes of pore waters that enter the <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> during low tide. Using a flushing time of four days and the average activities of 224 Ra, 223 Ra, and 228 Ra measured in the back-barrier surface and pore waters, we construct a balance of these isotopes, which is sustained by pore water flux of (2 - 4) x 108 liters per tidal cycle. This flux transports Ra and the other enriched components to the <b>tidal</b> <b>channels</b> and causes the observed low tide enrichments. An independent estimate of pore water discharge is based on the depletion of U in the <b>tidal</b> <b>channels.</b> The U-based recharge is about 2 x greater than the Ra-based discharge; however, other sinks of U could reduce the recharge estimate. Because the pore waters have wide ranges of enrichment in silica, alkalinity, manganese, DOC, and depletion of U with depth, we estimate concentrations of these components in pore water from the depth expected to contribute the majority of the pore water flux, 3. 5 m, to determine fluxes of these components to the <b>tidal</b> <b>channels.</b> We also estimate the exports of these components (and import of U) due to mixing based on average measured concentrations in the tidal creeks and the 4 day flushing time. A comparison of these estimates reveals that the exports (negative in the case of U) equal or exceed the pore water fluxes. By using values slightly higher than the minimum concentrations in the pore waters to calculate inputs, the two estimates could be forced to match. We conclude that pore water drainage is the major factor regulating fluxes of Ra isotopes, silica, alkalinity, manganese, DOC, and uranium in this system...|$|R
