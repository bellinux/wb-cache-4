5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E
5|$|The current {{reference}} range for acceptable blood lead concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental {{sources of lead}} is less than 5µg/dL for children. It was less than 25µg/dL for adults. Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl). The current biological exposure index (a level <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> exceeded) for lead-exposed workers in the U.S. is 30µg/dL in a random blood specimen.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

The PBL lists not only dynamic IP {{addresses}} but also static addresses <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sending email directly to third-party servers. Examples of such are an ISP's core routers, corporate users required by policy to send their email via company servers, and unassigned IP addresses.

25|$|Svante E. Cornell {{argued that}} {{although}} Tagliavini’s report did claim that Georgia started the war, <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{confused with the}} question of responsibility. He also criticised the argument that Georgia was legally bound by agreements not to use force, because the mission failed to discuss their validity if broken by either the South Ossetians or by Russia. Cornell also criticised the report for not taking account of the considerable evidence accumulated by scholars such as Andrey Illarionov.|$|E

25|$|Humility was an {{important}} principle.

If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.|$|E
25|$|Most simply, given {{a list of}} polyominoes {{of order}} n, squares may be added next to each polyomino in each {{possible}} position, and the resulting polyomino of order n+1 {{added to the list}} if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered reduce the number of cases that need to be checked for duplicates.

25|$|Some {{religious}} groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding {{on the grounds}} of the ideology of other {{religious groups}} restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{elevating}} privacy concerns, HTML5 {{also adds}} a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> allowed to access web storage. Content Security Policy is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating {{and a standard}} HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, {{reducing the number of}} vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.|$|E
25|$|The kanto singers of {{the period}} were also composers. Set to {{extraordinarily}} simple melodies which were the fashion of the day, the lyrics relied heavily of tensions {{between men and women}} as well as reflecting topical events. The compositions were in such fundamental makams as Rast, Hüzzam, Hicaz, Hüseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and by their creators, artists such as Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni. Küçük and Büyük Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin. That kanto brought an erotic element to the stage performance was an important aspect and one <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> overlooked or separated out.|$|E
25|$|Military success brought Bismarck {{tremendous}} {{political support}} in Prussia. In {{the elections of}} 1866 the liberals suffered a major defeat, losing their majority in the House of Deputies. The new, largely conservative House was on much better terms with Bismarck than previous bodies; at the Minister President's request, it retroactively approved the budgets {{of the past four}} years, which had been implemented without parliamentary consent. Bismarck suspected it would split the liberal opposition. While some liberals argued that constitutional government was a bright line <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> crossed, most of them believed it would be a waste of time to oppose the bill, and supported it in hopes of winning more freedom in the future.|$|E
