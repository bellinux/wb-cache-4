40|$|Abstract: The vertical, {{longitudinal}} {{and lateral}} dynamic behaviour of road vehicles is largely inu-enced by the dynamic characteristics of tyres. The tyre characteristics have been modelled by research-ers as {{functions of the}} tyre elastic properties which are characterized by tyre vertical, lateral, longitudinal and torsional stiVnesses. Design details of an experimental rig for measurement of tyre static stiVnesses are presented, and experimental data on these stiVness values {{in the form of}} a power law as functions of <b>tyre</b> size, <b>ply</b> rating, normal load and ination pressure are reported. Using tyre models, the tyre force and moment characteristics necessary for vertical dynamic simulation can be predicted...|$|R

40|$|A {{method used}} to measure the radial {{suspension}} properties of agricultural tractor tyres is described. The stiffness and damping of a range of tyres have been measured. The effects on tyre stiffness and damping coefficient of rolling speed, inflation pressure, load, amplitude, frequency of vibration, driving torque, surface type, <b>tyre</b> size, <b>ply</b> rating, construction, wear and age are reported. A relationship is developed which enables the stiffness of a rolling tyre to be estimated from the tyre size, age and inflation pressure. It is shown that this is a more accurate estimate of rolling tyre stiffness than measurement of the stiffness of a stationary tyre. The measured tyre characteristics are used to predict the vibration of a single degree of freedom system and of a four wheel tractor. Significant improvements in accuracy are found when the results are compared with those obtained using stationary tyre characteristics. The frequencies of the natural pitch and vertical modes of vibration are usually predicted to within ± 10 %. Predictions of rms acceleration levels are less accurate. Further improvements in modelling accuracy should be achieved by more accurate measurement and modelling of the suspension characteristics of the drive wheels in the longitudinal direction...|$|R

5000|$|The {{drophead}} coupé (DHC) had a padded, lined canvas top, which folded {{onto the}} rear deck behind the seats when retracted, and roll-up windows with opening quarter lights. The flat glass two-piece windscreen {{was set in}} a steel frame that was integrated with the body and painted the same colour. Dashboards and door-caps in both the DHC and the closed coupé (FHC) were wood-veneered, whereas the more spartan roadsters were leather-trimmed. All models had removable spats ("fender skirts" [...] in America) covering the rear wheel arches, which enhanced the streamlined look. On cars fitted with optional centre-lock wire wheels (available from 1951), the spats were omitted as they gave insufficient clearance for the chromed, two-eared Rudge-Whitworth knockoff hubs. Chromium-plated wire wheels were optional from 1953. When leaving the factory it originally fitted 6.00 × 16 inch cross <b>ply</b> <b>tyres</b> on 16 × 5K solid wheels (Pre-1951).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted radial tyre under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the <b>tyre</b> including <b>ply,</b> belts, and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial tyre subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R
50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial <b>ply</b> <b>tyres,</b> having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{black is}} a generic term for an {{important}} {{family of products}} used for the reinforcement of rubber, {{which is also a}} black pigment, and an electrically conductive properties of filler material. It is a fluffy powder of extreme fineness and high surface area, composed essentially of elemental carbon. Carbon black is one of thermo-stable product among the chemicals used in rubber compounding. Carbon black in general is the most widely used filler material in rubber industry. Carbon black is made from hydrocarbon fuel and therefore costly and has to be imported to Srilanka. Paddy husk is a natural source which can be converted to Carbon black and can be very cost effective. In an Agricultural country like Srilanka, paddy husk is abundantly available and also it would be uplifting to local industry as a readily available renewable raw material source. Carbon black particle size plays a major role with regard to cured rubber properties. It is directly related to strength of cured article. When a compound is used for <b>tyre</b> tread or <b>plies,</b> Carbon black particle size will be the most critical parameter. Carbon black particle size is not so critical when compounding in tyre bead, inner liner, and chafer compounds. When Carbon black is to be produced from paddy husk, first, it is under gone pyrolysis in inert atmospheric conditions and converted into carbonized paddy husks. Then, carbonized paddy husk is ground in a grinder and further fined by ball milling. Accordingly it can be made fine 200 nm level of particle size which is confirmed by Iodine adsorption number analysis. As per the tensile, hardness, rheological test results, it was decided to use Paddy Husk Carbon Black (PHCB) for the inner liner compound of tube type pneumatic bias <b>ply</b> <b>tyre.</b> Accordingly, differently proportionate compound samples were prepared by replacing the existing normal carbon black with PHCB. Seven compound batches were prepared and rheological and physical properties were analyzed. According to test results, it was found that 40 % of Normal carbon black could be replaced by PHCB for inner liner compound. Then selected sample is compared with the existing compound by Ply adhesion, Tear resistance tests and Age analysis so as to confirm suitability of inner liner compound. Further, selected compound was applied in actual tyre and feasibility of curing optimization in a normal manufacturing press is confirmed by thermocouple test...|$|R
40|$|Com o presente trabalho, teve-se como objetivo comparar o consumo de combustível de um trator agrícola operando com pneus (radial, {{diagonal}} e de baixa pressão) em duas condições de lastragem (com e sem água nos pneus) e quatro velocidades de deslocamento. O experimento foi realizado na FCAV-UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP, em condição de preparo do solo com escarificador. Utilizou-se um trator 4 x 2 TDA, com potência de 89 kW (121 CV) no motor. Os pneus foram do tipo R 1, com as seguintes características: radial (dianteiros: 14. 9 R 26; traseiros: 620 / 75 R 30) diagonal (dianteiros: 14. 9 - 26, traseiros: 23. 1 - 30) e BPAF (dianteiros: 500 / 60 - 26. 5; traseiros: 700 / 55 - 34). O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 x 4, com 24 tratamentos e 3 repetições. Os resultados evidenciaram vantagens para o trator quando equipado com pneus radiais. A condição de lastragem com água nos pneus ofereceu menor consumo específico.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The wide use of wire-reinforced rubber products such as conveyor belts, hose and radial <b>ply</b> <b>tyres</b> has reawakened interest in the parameters affecting the adhesion of rubber to brass plated steel wire. My research work {{is an attempt to}} improve and explain the rubber to metal bonding technology; it is concerned with the effect of rubber compounding ingredients as well as wire surface factors on adhesion. This work pertains to show the role played by two of the recently introduced and widely used bonding systems namely (i) Hexamethylene tetramine-resorcinol system and (ii) the Triazine system (Vulcabond SW) * on the adhesion of the rubber to brass plated steel wire. Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to brass plated steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to brass plated steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties. Because of the widespread use of radial tyres in the automobile industry and in every field in which heavy types of tyres are used, this research considers in detail the phenomena of fatigue and pressure at various temperatures on bond life. Also wire ageing is considered to be very important and to effect the bond between the rubber and the brass plated steel. * Trade name of Vulnax International Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of the research}} described in this thesis is to assess the technical feasibility of pneumatic tyres for passenger cars which have no directional reinforcement in their carcasses. Conventional tyres are constructed from composites of twisted textile or steel cords in a rubber matrix, a process which is both labour intensive and costly. If it were possible to injection mould or cast tyre carcasses in a single operation, and if the performance of the resulting tyres matched that of modern radial <b>ply</b> <b>tyres,</b> then the implications for the tyre industry would be of major proportions. After reviewing the history of pneumatic tyres and summarising their principal attributes, the design of unreinforced or fabricless tyres is investigated and methods developed for defining their meridional profiles. Materials suitable for their carcasses and treads are then considered, prior to describing the manufacture of two series of tyres designed to have section height to width ratios, or aspect ratios, of 0. 9 and 0. 7 respectively. To facilitate experimental work, two sizes of tyres were employed: half scale models for which testing procQdures had been developed previously; and a size suitable for small saloon cars. The results obtained on a range of tyre properties are presented and analysed to give a number of empirical relationships between the properties and the design variables: carcass material Young's modulus, carcass wall thickness and the inflation pressure. For the important property of radial stiffness which affects other tyre characteristics, an improved method of analysis is developed to allow the structural and pneumatic components to be quantified. Using the relationships established experimentally, consideration is given to optimising the design of a fabricless tyre. It is concluded that to approach the performance of a conventional tyre, a design with a low aspect ratio is preferred but, to restrict growth with inflation'pressure, limited directional reinforcement must be included as a circumferential-belt beneath the tread. Nevertheless, the discussion concludes that there are fundamental reasons why even the optimised tyre would be unacceptable for use on modern passenger cars, although less demanding applications may be identified...|$|R
