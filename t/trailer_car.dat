5|$|Two of the 1960 stock {{cars were}} {{converted}} to work as pilot motor cars in 1987. The conversion was carried out at British Rail Engineering Limited's works at Derby. They were numbered L132 and L133, and were used to haul a track recording car around the system. The recording car is numbered TRC666, and was converted from a 1973-built <b>trailer</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, c2c's East Ham depot began putting {{advertising}} vinyl wraps on some carriages, {{starting with}} branding the MSO intermediate <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> 74716 in set 357 216 as a 'Cough-Free Zone' by the cough syrup makers Benylin for the winter.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to safety}} considerations, {{platform}} screen doors are installed. Uniformed security personnel and security cameras are present at all platforms. Currently 19 three-car metro trains, of the Siemens Modular Metro type, are used. Each metro train {{consists of two}} motor cars and a centre <b>trailer</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to apply TOPS to diesel {{multiple}} units saw each carriage within a unit being allocated its own unique class number. This was probably because most DMUs were not kept in permanent formations. Classes were allocated according to the following division: 100-131: Driving Motor <b>cars</b> 140-150: Driving <b>Trailer</b> <b>cars</b> 160-190: <b>Trailer</b> <b>cars</b> 201-203: DEMU Driving Motor cars 211-212: DEMU Driving <b>Trailer</b> <b>cars</b> 221-225: DEMU <b>Trailer</b> <b>cars</b> 251: Express DEMU Driving Motor cars 261: Express DEMU <b>Trailer</b> <b>cars</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The 150x {{cars were}} {{converted}} from former 100x driving <b>trailer</b> <b>cars,</b> the 160x cars were converted from former 120x motor cars, and the 170x cars were converted from former 110x driving <b>trailer</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each train sets {{consists}} of four motor <b>cars</b> and four <b>trailer</b> <b>cars,</b> equipped with two driving units, {{and each of them}} {{is in charge of the}} driving of two motor <b>cars</b> and two <b>trailer</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
25|$|Nine cars of {{the first}} set were {{delivered}} from Tokyu Car's Yokohama factory to Tokyu's Nagatsuta Depot in Kanagawa Prefecture between 29 and 31 March 2011. These cars were formed into a 10-car set with the inclusion of intermediate motor car 4601, renumbered from former 5050 series <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> 5469, which was itself previously renumbered from motor car 5918. The second 10-car set was delivered from Tokyu Car in June 2011.|$|E
25|$|Each train {{consists}} of two 3-car Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) sets {{with a total of}} 6 cars. Each 3-car EMU set is permanently coupled as DM-T-M, where DM is the motor car with cab, T is a <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> and M is the motor car without cab. Each motor car has two AC traction motors. The configuration of a 6-car train is DM-T-M-M-T-DM. Like Toronto subway's Toronto Rocket, each train features open gangways, allowing passengers to move freely between cars.|$|E
25|$|The basic East Coast (ECML) {{formation}} {{was originally}} 2 + 8, increased to 2 + 9 in 2002 when extra stock became available. The ECML formation is nominally two first-class coaches, one buffet (with further 1st Class seating) and five (later six) standard-class coaches, sandwiched between the buffet and power cars. For a few years, formations included a TRUK (trailer restaurant kitchen) and buffet car {{as well as}} TS (trailer second class) and TF (trailer first class) coaches, many formations being 4 × TS, TRUK, Buffet, 2 × TF. Nine <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> units followed this formation, {{with the addition of}} a TS. 'Pullman' services replace a TS with an additional first-class coach.|$|E

25|$|Two demonstrator/prototype INNOVIA ART 100 {{cars were}} built {{and used for}} testing at the UTDC urban transit {{facility}} Millhaven, Ontario. Unlike the production cars, the demo cars lacked doors {{at either end of}} the vehicle. Test Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and on the driver cab, while Test Vehicle 2 is a <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring). Only Test Vehicle 2 remained at the facility and in 2011 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} (DSB class MM-FM-MM) {{was introduced in}} 1934 {{at the opening of}} the network, and consisted of three carriages per train set (2 motor cars and 1 <b>trailer</b> <b>car),</b> manufactured from 1934 to 1962. [...] supplied the electric components while Scandia (now Bombardier Transportation Denmark) supplied the car bodies and non-electric components. They were retired in 1978, and one was used as a heritage train until 2003, when DSB decided to discontinue its use. They are the longest serving S-train rolling stock to date, in continuous service for 44 years.|$|E
2500|$|Montreal's Metro {{trains are}} made of {{low-alloy}} high-tensile steel, painted blue with a thick white stripe running lengthwise. Trains are assembled in three-, six- or nine-car lengths. Each three-car segment element consists of two motor cab cars encompassing a <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> (M-T-M). Each car is [...] wide and has three (MPM-10) or four (MR-63, MR-73) wide bi-parting leaf doors on each side for rapid passenger entry and egress. Design specifications called for station dwell times of typically 8 to 15 seconds. In response to overcrowding on the Orange Line, a redesign of the MR-73 cars removed some seats to provide more standing room. The newest Bombardier MPM-10 trains allow people to move between cars once on board, so that the passenger load is more evenly distributed.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent orders {{saw another}} 154 power <b>cars,</b> 67 <b>trailer</b> <b>cars</b> and 85 driving <b>trailer</b> <b>cars</b> built by Comeng. These were all built to the Series 2 design with Budd type {{polished}} inserts on the carriage sides, flat rather than tapered number 2 ends, throw-over rather than sliding reversible seats, upgraded interior lights and a natural stainless steel finish.|$|R
50|$|The Q38 stock {{consisted}} of 25 driving motor <b>cars</b> and 183 <b>trailers.</b> Motor <b>cars</b> were numbered in the District line 4xxx series whilst the <b>trailer</b> <b>cars</b> were numbered with the O and P stock trailers.|$|R
50|$|The 305 series {{trains are}} formed as six-car sets as shown below, {{numbered}} W1 to W6, consisting of four motored intermediate cars and two non-powered driving <b>trailer</b> <b>cars.</b> Car 1 {{is at the}} Nishi-Karatsu end.|$|R
50|$|Incomplete <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> 441T was {{converted}} to experimental <b>trailer</b> <b>car</b> 201BT in 1950 with double width sliding doors to test design features for the Harris train. Later, a new 441T was constructed.|$|E
50|$|Most EMUs {{constitute}} of a Driver Car (1) a Middle Car (2) and a Driver <b>Trailer</b> <b>Car</b> (3). EMUs 60-79 have a Driver Car (1) a Middle Car (2) and a <b>Trailer</b> <b>Car</b> (4).|$|E

50|$|The train {{consisted}} of three motor <b>cars</b> and two <b>trailer</b> <b>cars.</b> The motor cars were about twice as heavy as the <b>trailer</b> <b>cars,</b> and the <b>trailers</b> were significantly more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to never couple two <b>trailer</b> <b>cars</b> together, but to always have a single trailer between two motor cars. The heavier motor cars provided stability for the lighter trailers. In the Malbone Street wreck train, two trailers were coupled together, and it was these two cars, in order numbers 80 and 100, that sustained {{the bulk of the}} damage, both to the cars and to the passengers.|$|R
