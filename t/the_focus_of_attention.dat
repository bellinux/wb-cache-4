5|$|Badmotorfinger was {{released}} on September 24, 1991 through A Records. The album peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It {{was released}} nearly one month after Pearl Jam's Ten and {{on the same day}} as Nirvana's Nevermind, all of which helped to break alternative rock and grunge into the mainstream. Although overshadowed {{at the time of its}} release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana's Nevermind, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. Badmotorfinger was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992. Badmotorfinger sold a million copies in the early 1990's, was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993 and certified double platinum in April 1996, signifying two million shipped copies.|$|E
40|$|Binding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} cognitive functions, how to find the correspondence of sensations between different modalities such as vision and touch. Without a priori knowledge on this correspondence, binding is regarded to be a formidable issue for a robot since it often perceives multiple physical phenomena in its different modal sensors, therefore it should correctly match <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in different modalities that may have multiple correspondences each other. We suppose that learning the multimodal representation of the body should be the first step toward binding since the morphological constraints in self-body-observation would make the binding problem tractable. The multimodal sensations are expected to be constrained in perceiving own body so as to configurate the unique parts of the multiple correspondence reflecting its morphology. In this paper, we propose a method to match <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in vision and touch through the unique association by cross-anchoring different modalities. Simple experiments show the validity of the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls with pictures of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic coffins, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.|$|E

25|$|The insular cortex, in {{particular}} its most anterior portion, {{is considered a}} limbic-related cortex. The insula has increasingly become <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region {{plays a role in}} mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of embodied cognition.|$|E

25|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> {{has been}} the severe impact due to {{biofouling}} on the speed of marine vessels. In some instances the hull structure and propulsion systems can become damaged. Over time, the accumulation of biofoulers on hulls increases both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the frictional effects leading to increased drag of up to 60% The additional drag can decrease speeds up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising {{up to half of}} marine transport costs, biofouling methods are estimated to cost the shipping industry around $1 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72 percent by 2020.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E

Under these circumstances, could hardly be effective Hausdorff's book in the first five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the suggestions that were included in this work in such abundance, and with no doubt, the topology was <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> The journal Fundamenta Mathematicae played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff ideas, founded in Poland in 1920. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic and foundations of mathematics. In this spectrum, a special focus was the general topology. Hausdorff's Principles were present in Fundamenta Mathematicae from the first volume in a remarkable frequency. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff's own three works not calculated), which appeared in the first twenty volumes from 1920 to 1933, 88 cite Principles. One even has to take into account that as Hausdorff's conceptions increasingly became commonplace, so they were also used in a number of works that did not mention it explicitly.|$|E

The letters were dried and photographed, then soaked in salt water for 24 hours before being re-inserted into their envelopes, without the eyelash that had been planted there.

40|$|Although musicians {{often have}} to perform under high pressure, there is little {{systematic}} research into <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> needed to maintain performance in such situations. In the current study, we asked elite musicians to report what they focus on and think about during moments of high pressure, using two retrospective methods (concept mapping and verbal reports). For concept mapping, seven expert teachers from an elite academy of music generated clusters of statements about this issue. In the verbal reports, 44 elite musicians described their thoughts and <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> Concept mapping resulted in six clusters, of which "focus on physical aspects," "thoughts that give confidence," and "music-related focus" were shown to be <b>the</b> main <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> together representing 85. 2 % of all 190 statements generated in the verbal reports. Statements regarding "music-related focus" represented 49. 7 % of all statements.
