Recombinant factor VIIa can induce {{hemostasis}} {{and controls}} bleeding in surgery in hemophilia inhibitor patients {{and in other}} hemostatic disorders, e. g. thrombocytopenia, platelet function disorders, coagulation disorders due to drugs and liver disease, in trauma and surgical patients. We describe the use of rF VIIa in bleeding episodes and surgery in four hemophilia A inhibitor patients. Patients and methods. We used rF VIIa in 6 bleeding episodes and in 3 surgical procedures (intracerebral and subdural hematoma, hematoma of the sculp) in four hemophilia inhibitor patients. 90 µg/kg b. w. rF VIIa was given every 2 hours for 24 – 82 hours, then the time interval was gradually changed to 6 hours. The <b>treatement</b> duration depends on the site and severity of bleeding and surgery. The traditional assays are not suitable for monitoring the hemostatic effect of rF VIIa.
