25|$|Neil Gaiman's comic series The Sandman {{uses the}} {{play as a}} focal point in issue No. 19. In it, Shakespeare and his company perform the play for the real Oberon and Titania and an {{audience}} of fairies. The play is heavily quoted in the comic. Shakespeare's son Hamnet Shakespeare appears in the play as the Indian boy. It is strongly hinted that he is later taken away by Titania, much like <b>the</b> <b>changeling</b> in the story. This issue {{was the first and}} only comic to win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction, in 1991.|$|E
25|$|While Princess Cadence was {{preparing}} {{to be married to}} Shining Armor(the captain of the Royal Guard of Canterlot, and the brother of Twilight Sparkle) in Canterlot, changelings (creatures that can change their physical form, and feed off the love of others) covertly snuck into the town. <b>The</b> <b>changeling</b> queen, Queen Chrysalises, imprisoned and impersonated Cadence, so she could feed off Shining Armor's love for her. Twilight Sparkle discovered this just before the imposter of Cadence and Shining Armor could be wed. She then freed Cadence, allowing Cadence and Shining Armor to defeat the Changelings with the power of their love, {{with the help of the}} bearers of the Elements of Harmony (the Mane 6 ponies).|$|E

50|$|In {{the initial}} Deep Space Nine {{relaunch}} novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by Ro Laren, {{who is working}} for the Bajoran Militia. Subsequent novels have Odo learn that <b>the</b> Hundred- <b>the</b> <b>changelings</b> like himself and Laas who were sent out into the universe- were actually sent to find the 'Progenitor' of <b>the</b> <b>Changelings,</b> who vanished centuries ago, and without whom <b>the</b> <b>Changelings</b> cannot reproduce. Odo subsequently discovers the corpse of the progenitor, prompting <b>the</b> other <b>Changelings</b> to disperse. Odo and Laas are able to reassemble some Changelings into a new link, but Odo is subsequently trapped in the Alpha Quadrant after the wormhole is disrupted by an attempt by rival powers to secretly use it to steal Jem'Hadar technology.|$|R

25|$|In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo {{viewed the}} play {{as full of}} symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for {{permanence}} in mutability. The play uses the principle of discordia concors in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has {{to give up her}} motherly obsession with <b>the</b> <b>changeling</b> boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The Wits is {{also known}} for the {{frontispiece}} by John Chantry. This is often assumed to represent the Red Bull Theatre, although this is disputed as being unlikely; it is not described as such before 1809, and is not consistent with what is known of it. It {{is one of the}} earliest illustrations of a theatre interior, showing chandeliers and lighting {{at the front of the}} stage, a curtained entrance, which may be genuine representations. However, the various characters shown are a catalogue, not an example of a scene as staged. They include Falstaff (by far the most popular theatrical character of the seventeenth century), a hostess, (perhaps Mistress Quickly), Clause (from The Lame Commonwealth), French Dancing Mr, (a dancing fiddler), <b>The</b> <b>Changeling,</b> and Simpleton, a character played by Cox.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. <b>The</b> <b>changeling</b> aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E

25|$|World War II had {{a greater}} impact on the novel than in poetry. It ended the careers of some novelists and delayed the start of others. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Robin Jenkins (1912–2005), Jessie Kesson (1916–94), Muriel Spark (1918–2006), Alexander Trocchi (1925–84) and James Kennaway (1928–68) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Jenkins major novels such as The Cone Gatherers (1955), <b>The</b> <b>Changeling</b> (1958) and Fergus Lamont (1978) focused on working-class {{dilemmas}} in a world without spiritual consolation. Very different in tone, Spark produced novels that explored modern social life as in her only two overtly Scottish novels The Ballad of Peckham Rye (1960) and the Edinburgh-set The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean (1922–87), and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett (b. 1923). A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Allan Massie (b. 1938), Shena Mackay (b. 1944) and Alan Spence (b. 1947). Massie's work often deals with historical themes while aware of the limitations of historical objectivity, as in his Augustus (1986), Tiberius (1991) and The Ragged Lion (1994). Working class identity continued to be a major theme in the post-war novel and can be seen in Archie Hind's (1928–2008) The Dear Green Place (1966), Alan Sharp's (1934–2013) A Green Tree in Gedde (1965), George Friel's (1910–75) Mr Alfred M.A. (1972) and William McIlvanney's (b. 1936) Docherty (1975).|$|E
500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} RADA, Hiddleston {{was cast in}} his first film role, playing Oakley in Joanna Hogg's first feature film, Unrelated (2006). His sister Emma also {{appeared}} in the film as Badge. Casting director, Lucy Bevan, who cast him in the film said [...] "there was just a fantastic confidence about him". Hiddleston had leading roles in Declan Donnellan's company Cheek by Jowl's productions <b>The</b> <b>Changeling</b> (2006), and Cymbeline (2007). For the latter he won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Newcomer in a Play. His Donmar Warehouse credits include Cassio in Michael Grandage's production of Shakespeare's Othello (2008) alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ewan McGregor, and Lvov in the West End revival of Chekhov's Ivanov (2008) with Kenneth Branagh.|$|E

Set {{photographs}} and studio production reports (on file in the Warner Brothers collection at University of Southern California, and the Warner Bros. collection of studio key books at George Eastman House in Rochester, New York) in fact contradict Anger's claims, conclusively proving that the character was played by a girl named Sheila Brown.

[...] Their desks faced each other in the office and Vajna’s wife and Kassar’s girlfriend were their secretaries. [...] Kassar and Vajna served as executive producers on <b>The</b> <b>Changeling</b> (1980), The Amateur (1981), and Escape to Victory (1981). [...] The latter film marked the first time for both Kassar and Vajna to have worked with Sylvester Stallone.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1964, Jan Kott {{offered his}} own {{views on the}} play. He viewed as main themes of the play {{violence}} and [...] "unrepressed animalistic sexuality". Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, their love interests are exchangeable and objectified. <b>The</b> <b>changeling</b> that Oberon desires is his new [...] "sexual toy". The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are promiscuous. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed {{to talk about it}} because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves. Kott's views were controversial and contemporary critics wrote, either in favour of or against Kott's views, but few ignored them.|$|E
