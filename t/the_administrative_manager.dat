Through this survey we have explored whether {{the size of the}} activity units affect how extensive the internal control tends to be. Another factor that can affect the extent of the internal control of municipals is what kind of damage that exists in the unit. Yet, it doesn’t seem to be a correlation between the cost of the internal control and how well it seems to work. The dissertation is written in Swedish...|$|R
