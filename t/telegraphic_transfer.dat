The transaction was originally quoted at 6 million euros from François Charles Oberthur of Paris (a supplier of Visa and MasterCards) but was awarded to a British firm, the Anglo-Leasing and Finance Company Limited, at 30 million euros, who would have sub-contracted the same French firm to do the work. Despite the lack of competitive tendering Anglo Leasing was paid a [...] "commitment fee" [...] of more than £600,000.

50|$|Unlike Australia, in the {{critical}} period between 1914 and the Great depression, New Zealand did not have anything that corresponded to a central bank or a monetary authority. New Zealand's link to the pound sterling was purely through the Gold Specie Standard, and when the Gold Specie Standard was suspended at {{the outbreak of the}} first world war, the linkage was based on nothing other than existing practice. The banks controlled <b>telegraphic</b> <b>transfers</b> between New Zealand and London, and so the exchange rate was entirely in their hands. New Zealand was now effectively on a sterling exchange standard, controlled by the largely Australian trading banks, and this sterling exchange standard became a gold exchange standard for the period between 1925 and 1931 when the United Kingdom was on a gold bullion standard. It wasn't however until the Great depression that the Australian banks created any substantial divergence from the traditional one-to-one parity between the London pound and the New Zealand pound. Australian and New Zealand raw exports to London were badly hit by the depression, and in an attempt to sustain demand, the Australian banks decided to sell the New Zealand pound at a 9% discount, taking the exchange rate to 110 New Zealand pounds to 100 pounds sterling by 1931. As this was new territory in the history of money, the situation became somewhat confused because a state of affairs now existed in which the exchange rate as between Australia and New Zealand was at par and did not correspond to their respective exchange rates with London. By 1933 the situation had settled to a state of affairs in which the New Zealand pound and the Australian pound were both at a 20% discount with respect to the London pound, taking the exchange rate to New Zealand 125 pounds equaling 100 pounds sterling. New Zealand joined the sterling area in 1939 at the outbreak of the second world war and in 1948, the New Zealand pound once again returned to parity with the pound sterling.|$|R

50|$|Australia {{returned}} to the gold standard in 1925 {{in conjunction with the}} United Kingdom and South Africa. As {{in the case of the}} United Kingdom, there was no return to a gold specie standard, but rather the introduction of a gold bullion standard. This once again formally locked the pound in Australia to parity with the pound in the United Kingdom. During the period between 1914 and 1925, the <b>telegraphic</b> money <b>transfers</b> between London and Australia had deviated somewhat from parity, but at that time, it was merely seen as a temporary hitch due to the emergency and the suspension of the gold standard. Nobody considered the Australian pound as such to be a separate currency from sterling. However, in 1929 the Great Depression occurred, and the raw producing nations in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand were the first to feel the effects. The Australian banks that controlled the exchanges with London began to sell the Australian unit at a discount in order to increase the competitiveness of their exports to London. The gold standard in Australia was simultaneously abandoned and the Australian pound was now at a 25% discount to the pound sterling.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{widely used}} service for wire {{transfers}} was launched by Western Union in 1872 on its existing telegraph network.

50|$|A Redirection of Transfer {{charge is}} {{included}} in bank charges and are only required on specific transfer occasions only. A redirection fee is a bank charge that is only paid to a bank when a mistake is made by another bank and a sum of amount is transferred into a wrong bank account in another bank. This may occur between continents,countries or states. A redirection fee is often expensive when required as the bank requiring this may not have legal rights to freeze the account the funds are mistakenly transferred into. It may also require urgent attention depending on the banking rules {{of the country and}} it takes a period of 30-45 minutes for a redirected transfer to be completed. This is normally caused in a Bank Wire Transfer, <b>Telegraphic</b> <b>Transfer</b> also known as Telex Transfer (T/T) and most times, local bank to bank transfer. A redirection fee is only needed to be paid to the bank the funds are in and the bank will have to redirect the transfer to its correct destination. Most banks calculate this type of bank charge according to the amount in question.|$|E

The rejection of Pedroni’s no within-dimension null hypothesis indicates that the adoption of one cashless payment method in either Austria, Belgium, France, Germany or Portugal, will affect the usage of the same cashless payment method in another EU country. The rejection of Pedroni’s no between-dimension null hypothesis indicates that the usage of either cheque payment, <b>telegraphic</b> <b>transfer,</b> card payment or electronic money, will significantly trigger the usage of another type of cashless payment. Therefore, it is possible for policymakers and bankers to consider innovating and improving the diffusion of one cashless payment at a time to ensure continuous benefits of the adoption of cashless payment system within the EU community.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{limits the}} study of the {{adoption}} of cashless payment to card payment, cheques, <b>telegraphic</b> <b>transfer,</b> and electronic money on five EU countries. It is true that trust drives online lending but not electronic payments. The vast development of cashless payment is fueled by the evolution in information technology and innovation in mobile devices. In the near future, technology such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and near field communication (NFC) will dominate the innovation in cashless payment. In 2014, Lollapalooza has launched Lolla Cashless, a cashless payment system through a wristband. The wristband is embedded with a RFID chip and consumer can purchase food and beverages by tapping the wristband on a technology-enable pad. In addition, Apple has also rolled out a new technology called “Apple Pay” in 2014. The Apple Pay is compatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone six Plus, and it is equipped with NFC and Touch ID sensor.|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 72). The internship report is designed to bridge the gulf between the theoretical knowledge and real life experience. It is designed to have a practical experience while passing through the theoretical understanding. I {{had the opportunity to}} complete my internship in a reputed bank. This report is the result of three months internship program with Prime Bank Limited, Banani branch. Bank is an intermediary institution that makes relationship between the owner of surplus savings and the investors of deficit capital. As the demand for the better service increases day by day, banking process is becoming faster and easier and banks are coming up with different innovative ideas and products. As an intern, I have worked in the General Banking (GB) department and have learned to do tasks like Issuing of Cheque Book, Cheque receive, Maintaining IBCA register, Fund Transfer, Cheque Debit, TT (<b>Telegraphic</b> <b>Transfer),</b> Pay Order and some other related tasks. I have also gained some practical knowledge about LBC (Local Bills for Collection), OBC (Outward Bills for Collection), DD (Demand Draft), inward and outward clearing functions, various reasons of dishonoring of Cheques and different savings scheme offered by this bank. Customer service quality is very important for a bank as lots depend on this and to evaluate PBL's customer service quality I have prepared a questionnaire and have taken fifty respondents answers and used SPSS software to analyze their responses. According to the respondents, Prime Bank Limited is a reputed bank; however they have rated it as number two bank among six private commercial banks. This shows lacking in marketing efficiency that does not been able to create a positive image to customers mind. PBL can do some CSR (Corporate Social Responsibilities) to improve its image. It has sixty three branches across Bangladesh; of them forty one are online. Respondents argue that PBL should introduce online facility throughout all of its branches and also should train its employees so that they can provide more faster and accurate service. In addition, respondents demand that FDR interest rate should be increased as PBL offers lower interest rate than that of some other private commercial banks. Most of the respondents are happy with the behavior of GB employees of PBL. With all its resources, the management of the bank should seek more ways to improve customer service quality so that the bank can create good image among its customers which ultimately will help it to grow faster and stay ahead of competition.
