40|$|A {{modified}} simple {{technique of}} sling operation {{is presented in}} 15 cases using the levator aponeurosis as the material for the sling as originally devised by Lemagne and Bemcher. The levator is cut behind the superior transverse ligament and the posterior part of the levator is cauterised and allowed to retract into the orbit. The horns are cut from behind forwards, and the levator, which is kept attached on the tarsal plate, is used <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> up <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> This method eliminates the jaw winking phenomenon as well as <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1464, Robert Grosvenor added a chantry chapel {{which was}} {{demolished}} in 1542 {{by order of}} Henry VIII. The Bog Oak chest housed in the Shakerley Chapel was used {{for many years to}} keep the Parish Register, vicars' robes, chalices and church documents. Tradition has it that if a girl wished to be a farmer's wife she should be able <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> chest <b>lid</b> with one arm. It is believed that this tale originated because it was said that a farmer's wife in those days needed to be strong enough to be able <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> famous Cheshire cheeses made in the area.|$|R
40|$|After {{the injury}} of facial nerve, facial muscles are {{subjected}} to complex series of biochemical and histological changes, which lead to muscular atrophy if reinnervation is not restored. Facial palsy {{is very difficult to}} manage completely. Regardless this fact, the plan of correction has to be directed towards the following: restoration of normal function, normal facial appearance at rest, symmetry in voluntary movements as well as symmetry in involuntary and emotional movements. Static suspension methods were used in our study. All patients had unilateral complete facial nerve palsy but one female patient who experienced the palsy of frontal branch of n. facialis. This method was successfully used <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> eyebrow, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> and to improve lagophthalmus on the paralytic side, then the angle and paralytic part of the lip, to reinforce buccal wall of oral cavity as well as to reconstruct new nasolabial fold. The results were satisfactory and permanent...|$|R

It was Stephen who {{stripped}} it {{of the black}} cloth it had worn, who stood by Virginia ready <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> when she had turned the lock. The girl's exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords, and those who heard were lifted, lifted far {{above and beyond the}} power of earthly spell.|$|E

5000|$|De Ruyter's burial {{site has}} now {{turned into a}} tourist attraction. His {{mausoleum}} is visible, protected by a glass pane. However, descendants of the De Ruyter family are granted unrestricted access to his grave, and one of De Ruyter's descendants stated in a 2007 issue of the Dutch newspaper Het Parool that he visited the coffin privately in 1948 with his own grandfather. They decided <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> coffin's <b>lid.</b> <b>The</b> grandson reported being shocked with the sight and said: [...] "it wasn't a pleasant sight. He (De Ruyter) was embalmed with great haste, and they didn't bother with his shot-off leg, they just dropped it in. It was just lying there. No, it wasn't pleasant, {{it was a shock}} actually." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Mina turns John into {{a vampire}} after convincing {{him that it}} is his destiny. A baby is also taken to the castle for Tepes to feed on so he will {{be strong enough to}} go to Quincey and Lily's wedding. Once Mary learns of John's transformation, she asks Rosemary Shaw for help escaping, as Rosemary never liked living as a vampire. Rosemary tells Mary where the baby is being kept and about a secret exit from the castle. Then, Rosemary asks to be {{destroyed}} because she doesn't want to live with her daughter dead and her son as a vampire. Mary kills her by pounding a stake through her heart. She takes the baby and runs to the courtyard, where the secret exit is. However, she doesn't have <b>the</b> strength <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>lid</b> of <b>the</b> trap door. Surprisingly, Quincey helps her escape by lifting it for her.|$|R
2500|$|In 1907, Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., {{suggested}} that Heywood {{might have been}} influenced by Lucian’s Icaro-Menippus when representing Jupiter on earth, notably the passage: “…close to every one was placed a golden chair. [...] Jupiter sat down in the first he came <b>to,</b> and <b>lifting</b> up <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prayers, which, as you may suppose, were of various kinds…One sailor asked for a north-wind, another for a south; the husbandmen prayed for rain, and the fuller for sun-shine…One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two men asking favors of him, directly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which to oblige.” ...|$|R
60|$|Neither of them spoke, and {{a strange}} hush {{fell over the}} room--a hush only broken by the click of metal against metal, and the deep {{breathing}} {{of the two men}} bending to their task. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was working with a file on the padlocks of the oak chest, and Sir Percy Blakeney, with a bunch of skeleton keys, was opening the drawers of the writing-desk. These, when finally opened, revealed nothing of any importance; but when anon Sir Andrew was able <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of the oak chest, he disclosed an innumerable quantity of papers and documents tied up in neat bundles, docketed and piled up in rows and tiers to {{the very top of the}} chest.|$|E
60|$|Next {{he pointed}} to the metal cup out of which he had drunk. Bickley filled it again from the thermos flask, which I {{observed}} excited his keen interest, for, having touched the flask with his hand and found that it was cool, he appeared to marvel that the fluid coming from it should be hot and steaming. Presently he smiled as though he had got the clue to the mystery, and swallowed his second drink of coffee and spirit. This done, he motioned to us <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of the lady's coffin, pointing out a certain catch in the bolts which at first we could not master, for it will be remembered that on this coffin these were shot.|$|E
60|$|For it {{was really}} an endless {{employment}} to guess what was inside. What could it be, indeed? Just imagine, my little hearers, how busy your wits would be, {{if there were a}} great box in the house, which, as you might have reason to suppose, contained something new and pretty for your Christmas or New Year's gifts. Do you think that you should be less curious than Pandora? If you were left alone with the box, might you not feel a little tempted <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid?</b> But you would not do it. Oh, fie! No, no! Only, if you thought there were toys in it, it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep! I know not whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had yet begun to be made, probably, in those days, when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it. But Pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls, here around me, would have felt. And, possibly, a little more so; but of that I am not quite so certain.|$|E
50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a heating chamber {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass <b>lid</b> to which <b>the</b> heating assembly is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users <b>to</b> safely <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> off <b>the</b> unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|R
40|$|A teapot, a stranger, a {{very clean}} house; diary of the {{unremarkable}} is a participatory enquiry into photography as both time-based medium and phenomenological encounter. Prior to the installation, 15 participants {{were invited to}} contribute short texts based {{on a series of}} images. The artist then created an image in response to each text. The process culminated in a series of photographic works inspired by everyday narratives which were anything but unremarkable. The project constituted a curious collaboration between everyday objects, participants, language, artist, technology, image and spectator. The installation was divided into two parts: The first room contained a collection of artifacts, assembled to evidence the process which scored the photographic practice. The audience was invited <b>to</b> peruse, contribute, <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> or open <b>the</b> cover and peek inside. The inner room held the series of images created in response to each participant’s contribution, as well as the artist herself. There was also an audio component to this part of the installation. These audio guides were distributed {{at the entrance to the}} inner room...|$|R
5000|$|The Play of the Weather is {{an early}} {{instance}} of the interlude or moral interlude, a theatrical development from the morality play and a precursor to the late Tudor drama in its portrayal {{of people from the}} lower classes rather than noble, biblical or classical characters. It tends to be grouped with a series of plays from Mankind onwards such as Gentleness and Nobility, Magnificence, Youth and Hick Scorner. It was published in quick succession with a number of Heywood’s other interludes such as Johan Johan, The Pardoner and the Frere and The Play of Love. [...] In 1907, Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., suggested that Heywood might have been influenced by Lucian’s Icaro-Menippus when representing Jupiter on earth, notably the passage: “…close to every one was placed a golden chair. Jupiter sat down in the first he came <b>to,</b> and <b>lifting</b> up <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prayers, which, as you may suppose, were of various kinds…One sailor asked for a north-wind, another for a south; the husbandmen prayed for rain, and the fuller for sun-shine…One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two men asking favors of him, directly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which to oblige.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he sank to {{the stage}} of {{depression}} that most people have made acquaintance with at some time or another, when a man begins to ask, [...] "What {{is the use of}} it? Why were we born? What good do we do here? Why should we--as the majority of mankind doubtless are--mere animals be laden up with sorrows till at last our poor backs break? Is God powerful or powerless? If powerful, why did He not let us sleep in peace, without setting us here to taste of every pain and mortification, to become acquainted with every grief, and then to perish miserably?" [...] Old questions these, which the sprightly critic justly condemns as morbid and futile, and not to be dangled before a merry world of make-believe. Perhaps he is right. It is better to play at marbles on a sepulchre than <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> and peep inside. But, for all that, they will arise when we sit alone at even in our individual wildernesses, surrounded, perhaps, by mementoes of our broken hopes and tokens of our beloved dead, strewn about us like the bleaching bones of the wild game on the veldt, and in spirit watch the red sun of our existence sinking towards its vapoury horizon. They will come even to the sanguine, successful man. One cannot always play at marbles; the lid of the sepulchre will sometimes slip aside of itself, and we must see. True, it depends upon individual disposition. Some people can, metaphorically, smoke cigarettes and make puns by the death-beds of their dearest friends, or even on their own. We should pray for a disposition like that--it makes life more pleasant.|$|E

They’re part of our persona, and the feelings of shame and humiliation we feel when we get them wrong are very personally felt. You need <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> on that." ...|$|E

60|$|This great idea, then, is the {{backbone}} of all folk-lore--the idea that all happiness hangs on one thin veto; all positive joy depends on one negative. Now, {{it is obvious that}} there are many philosophical and religious ideas akin to or symbolised by this; but it is not with them I wish to deal here. It is surely obvious that all ethics ought to be taught to this fairy-tale tune; that, if one does the thing forbidden, one imperils all the things provided. A man who breaks his promise to his wife ought to be reminded that, even if she is a cat, the case of the fairy-cat shows that such conduct may be incautious. A burglar just about to open some one else's safe should be playfully reminded that he is in the perilous posture of the beautiful Pandora: he is about <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> forbidden <b>lid</b> and loosen evils unknown. The boy eating some one's apples in some one's apple tree should be a reminder that he has come to a mystical moment of his life, when one apple may rob him of all others. This is the profound morality of fairy-tales; which, so far from being lawless, go to the root of all law. Instead of finding (like common books of ethics) a rationalistic basis for each Commandment, they find the great mystical basis for all Commandments. We are in this fairyland on sufferance; it is not for us to quarrel with the conditions under which we enjoy this wild vision of the world. The vetoes are indeed extraordinary, but then so are the concessions. The idea of property, the idea of some one else's apples, is a rum idea; but then the idea of there being any apples is a rum idea. It is strange and weird that I cannot with safety drink ten bottles of champagne; but then the champagne itself is strange and weird, if you come to that. If I have drunk of the fairies' drink it is but just I should drink by the fairies' rules. We may not see the direct logical connection between three beautiful silver spoons and a large ugly policeman; but then who in fairy tales ever could see the direct logical connection between three bears and a giant, or between a rose and a roaring beast? Not only can these fairy-tales be enjoyed because they are moral, but morality can be enjoyed because it puts us in fairyland, in a world at once of wonder and of war.|$|R

The Commentary: Much like describing a photograph of oneself, Practicing the Unremarkable: the Photograph as Performance attempts to describe the creation of diary of the unremarkable from both inside and outside the process, making use of theory and personal observation. A narrative account of the creative process is interwoven with both photographic and performance theory concerning construction of identity, concepts of time, and the tension between truth and fiction in photographic documentation. These elements serve to compel the reader towards an understanding of the ultimate aims of the creative project; those of addressing an engaged viewer in the final installation. A reflection on a process guided by intuition, as well as the specific curatorial choices made for the installation, further situate the photograph itself as the site of performance for both photographer and viewer. The commentary goes one step further in considering the life of the photograph beyond its role in this performance...|$|R

50|$|The {{thurible}} (Θυμιατο, Thymiato; Church Slavonic: Кадилница, kadilnitsa) used {{is often}} gold plated (combining in {{itself at the}} offering of incense the three gifts of the Biblical Magi: gold, frankincense, and myrrh). The thurible consists of a metal bowl (usually with a base so it can stand upright) into which the charcoal and incense are placed, and a lid (often topped with a cross), pierced by holes to allow the fragrance from the incense to escape. The censer will usually have three outer chains (for the Holy Trinity) attached to the bowl, and a fourth inner chain (for the Oneness of God) attached to the lid. The three outer chains are gathered together and attached to a round conical plate attached to a ring; the inner chain passes {{through a hole in}} the conical plate and is attached to another ring to make it easier <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> In the Greek and some Russian practice twelve bells will be attached to the chains (their ringing symbolizes the teaching of the twelve Apostles). Sometimes the bowl and lid of the thurible are decorated with crosses or icons in repousse, and may even be decorated with semi-precious stones. When not in use the thurible is usually hung from a hook in the sanctuary.|$|E
