5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E

500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. I could feel his heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire {{to do something about the}} Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take all the blood <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find out what I am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E

The Washington Posts Sarah Godfrey classified [...] "Love a Woman" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album adding that [...] "The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows how to love a woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats.

2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies... they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just {{gets in the way}} on so many of those things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E

60|$|I regained my compartment, which I {{was annoyed}} to find had filled up till mine {{was the only}} vacant seat. I had not had time to buy any papers or magazines, but, after all, I had enough to {{interest}} me in my thoughts. Of Tapilow I scarcely thought at all. He and I had met, and I had kept my oath. So far as I was concerned, that was the end. I had not even any fears for my own safety as regards this matter. My interview with Decresson and his friend had had a curiously convincing effect upon me. I felt that I had been tried for my crime, and acquitted, in the most orthodox fashion. For me the curtain had fallen upon that tragedy. It was the other things which occupied my mind. I seemed to have found my way into a maze, to have become mixed up in certain affairs in a most mysterious and inexplicable way. What was the meaning of that place to which Louis had introduced me? Was it {{some sort of secret}} organization,--an organization which assumed to itself, at any rate, the power to circumvent the police? And Bartot, too! Had he really the power which Louis had declared him to possess? If so, why had he baited a clumsy trap for me and permitted me to walk out of it untouched? What did <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> me, these people? The thought was utterly confusing. I could find absolutely no explanation. Then, again, another puzzle remained. I remembered Louis' desire, almost command, that I should return to London by this particular train. Had he any reason for it? Was it connected in any way, I wondered, with the presence of this man and girl in the next compartment? It seemed feasible, even if inexplicable.|$|E

40|$|Aims.   To {{report a}} study of patients’ views of patient-centred care. The study aimed to explore patients’ {{understanding}} and conceptualization of patient-centred care and link it to existing literature on the topic. Background.   Patient-centred care currently lacks a widely accepted definition, {{with much of the}} literature based on definitions formulated by health professionals and researchers. Design.   Qualitative research study grounded in phenomenology. Methods.   Interpersonal interviews were conducted with ten participants who were patients in a surgical ward in a large metropolitan hospital in South Australia in 2010. Results/findings.   Participants were unfamiliar with the concept of patient-centred care, but despite this, were able to describe what the term meant to them and what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>from</b> their care. Patients equated the type and quality of care they received with the staff that provided it and themes of connectedness, involvement and attentiveness were prevalent in their descriptions of what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>from</b> their care. Conclusion.   Ensuring that patients have a voice in the definition and conceptualization of patient-centred care is essential and further and regular consultation with patients about their needs and priorities will ensure an integrated approach to patient-centred care.
