5|$|Technical {{analysis}} shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed {{in a dry}} medium except for the dove and the flask and candles on <b>the</b> <b>sideboard.</b> Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.|$|E
25|$|The {{beauty of}} López García's work {{begins with an}} {{appreciation}} of his craft. Paintings such as <b>The</b> <b>Sideboard</b> (196566), or the atmospheric views of Madrid from the 1970s, show an acute perception {{and understanding of the}} beauty of the objects he portrays.|$|E
25|$|Harold Bodle (4 October 1920 – 1 January 2005) was an English footballer {{who played}} as an inside left or wing half. He played for Birmingham City {{in the top}} flight and for several clubs in the North of England in the lower {{divisions}} of the Football League. He was particularly noted for juggling the ball, a skill {{he claimed to have}} perfected as a child by repeatedly kicking a small ball against <b>the</b> <b>sideboard</b> at home.|$|E
5000|$|Bocce, {{a rolling}} game, is {{played on a}} smooth, {{prepared}} court with markers and sideboards; <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> are a recognized {{part of the game}} and shots may be bounced off of <b>the</b> <b>sideboards.</b> In contrast, pétanque, a throwing game, can be played on almost any relatively flat, unprepared outdoor surface. Sideboards are not a recognized part of the game [...] - [...] although an out-of-play line (or [...] "dead boule line") is.|$|R
50|$|The puck must hit <b>the</b> <b>sideboards,</b> or a playing figure {{other than}} the center must {{gain control of the}} puck before a goal can be counted.|$|R
50|$|All models had {{removable}} sideboards {{and overhead}} bows for a tarpaulin over the cargo area. All except the extra long M36 had folding troop seats in <b>the</b> <b>sideboards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Soane's {{paintings}} include: {{works by}} Canaletto entitled View of the Riva degli Schiavoni painted (1736) purchased in 1806 from William Thomas Beckford for 150 Guineas plus three other {{works by the}} artist, and paintings by Hogarth: the eight canvases of the A Rake's Progress, purchased {{from the collection of}} William Thomas Beckford, at auction for 570 Guineas in 1801, the other Hogarth paintings Soane purchased were the four canvases of the Humours of an Election bought at auction at Christie's from David Garrick's widow for £1,732, 10s in June 1823. Soane acquired three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner: St Hugues Denouncing Vegeance on the Shepherd of Cormayer Val D'Aoust (an oil painting), Kirkstall Abbey (watercolour) & Admiral Van Tromp's Barge entering the Texel (an oil painting). Thomas Lawrence painted a three quarter length portrait of Soane, it is hung over the Dining Room fireplace in the museum. Soane also has a painting by Antoine Watteau, a fête champêtre. Soane owned one oil painting by Joshua Reynolds's Love and Beauty, this hangs in the dining room over <b>the</b> <b>sideboard.</b> Soane commissioned an oil painting from Augustus Wall Callcott c.1830, entitled The Passage Point -Italian Composition.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Limited" [...] tournaments, players {{construct}} decks using booster packs plus {{any additional}} basic lands of their choice. The decks in Limited tournaments {{must be a}} minimum of forty cards. All unused cards function as <b>the</b> <b>sideboard,</b> which, as in [...] "Constructed" [...] formats, can be freely exchanged between games of a match, {{as long as the}} deck continues to adhere to the forty card minimum. The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply.|$|E
500|$|The royal dinners are {{described}} almost entirely in French, {{with the exception}} of the heading, the phrase [...] "Side Board", and a few specifically British dishes such as [...] "Roast Mutton" [...] and [...] "Haunch of Venison". There are usually two soups, two fishes, two removes, six entrées, two roasts, two more removes, six entremets, and between two and seven dishes on <b>the</b> <b>sideboard.</b> The exceptional royal dinner of 30 June 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets. Some of these entremets used the most costly ingredients including truffles in Champagne.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> at <b>the</b> Judges' Lodgings, one {{of which}} is known as the Dundee Cabinet, {{produced}} by Gillows to Talbert's designs, his characteristic carved squares, geometric designs and rows of spindles are clearly evident.|$|R
50|$|Originally titled <b>The</b> Duelist <b>Sideboard,</b> <b>the</b> {{first issue}} was a full-color, 32-page issue {{published}} in July 1996. The cover story was {{a preview of}} the upcoming Magic World Championships.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a silence}} while the domestics began their service, of which Montalvo took {{opportunity}} to study the room, {{the table and the}} guests. It was a fine room panelled with German oak, and lighted sufficiently, if not brilliantly, by two hanging brass chandeliers of the famous Flemish workmanship, in each of which were fixed eighteen of the best candles, while on <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> were branch candlesticks, also of worked brass. The light thus provided was supplemented by that from the great fire of peat and old ships' timber which burned in a wide blue-tiled fire-place, half way down the chamber, throwing its reflections upon many a flagon and bowl of cunningly hammered silver that adorned the table and <b>the</b> <b>sideboards.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{iconography}} is {{not overly}} labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism. [...] Many elements emphasize Mary's {{role as the}} Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on <b>the</b> <b>sideboard</b> are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her. White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or sword lilies were used as metaphors for her suffering. Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, and [...] "introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning." [...] Charles Sterling describes the work as [...] "one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with {{a heightened sense of}} emotion and narrative complexity." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1880s, Antony had Henry Woodyer {{redesign}} {{the hallway}} staircase. This allowed more light to permeate the lower floors from the glazed lantern roof, and hence turn the hallway into a reception room. Woodyer also extended the Dining Room by taking {{in part of}} the original housekeeper's room. Crace's original wallpaper– a British imitation of Japanese paper, that itself imitated Spanish tooled leather– was lightened by a 14-year-old apprentice who hand-painted in a cream background. <b>The</b> <b>sideboard,</b> which had been commissioned from Collier and Plucknett, was further extended. New items were also ordered from Collier and Plucknett. Simultaneously, Antony had electricity installed, an early UK example of houses being lit in this way. Antony spent the first night after turning on the electrical system watching the main entrance light, to ensure that it did not create a fire and was hence safe for his family. At some point between 1868 and 1884 a water hydraulic lift was installed by Waygood and Co., the remains of which were discovered in 2008. A wooden lift car was discovered on the ground floor and a [...] spanning sheave in the roof space.|$|E
500|$|The room to {{the north}} of the Drawing Room was {{originally}} the common parlour, and is now known as the Octagon Room. [...] It provided a link between the public rooms on the south of the house and the more private rooms on the north side. [...] Again designed by Carr, its canted corners contain china cabinets. It also contains a set of five paintings of Tabley by Anthony Devis. [...] The ceiling has Rococo plasterwork by Oliver. [...] This room leads to the Dining Room on the north side of the house, which contains paintings of the Leicester family. [...] These include 3rdLord Tabley by Frank Holl, Colonel Sir John Leicester, Bart., and the King's Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry exercising on the Sands at Liverpool by George Jones, Portrait of 2ndLorddeTabley by Margaret Carpenter, a full-length Portrait of 2nd Lord de Tabley as Colonel Commandant of the Earl of Chester's Yeomanry Cavalry by Francis Grant, Hilda, Mrs Cuthbert Leicester Warren by Simon Elwes, Lt. Colonel John Leicester Warren by Graham Rust, and Margaret Leicester Warren by Philip de László. [...] Also in the room is Extensive Picturesque Landscape, with Gypsies by Francis Bourgeois and, over <b>the</b> <b>sideboard,</b> is the Portrait of the Prince Regent, later George IV by Thomas Lawrence and his studio. [...] The fireplace in the Dining Room is made from Anglesey marble and was designed by George Bullock.|$|E
5000|$|Neobarock {{dining room}} : {{the second largest}} in the palace, is also called a Dutch room or couch room. In the dining room there is an oak wood {{paneling}} with <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> in it. An additional decoration is the panels with decorations referring to the Dutch painting of Delft.|$|R
60|$|Scott, with Faiz Ullah and two policemen, {{was already}} busied with the carts, backing {{them up to}} the truck and {{unbolting}} <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> quietly, while <b>the</b> others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat.

6000|$|The squires familiarly formal, and [...] My lords {{and ladies}} proudly condescending; [...] The very {{servants}} puzzling how to hand [...] Their plates--without {{it might be}} too much bending [...] From their high places by <b>the</b> <b>sideboard's</b> stand-- [...] Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending. [...] For any deviation from the graces [...] Might cost both man and master too--their places.|$|R
2500|$|Arne Jacobsen's grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, {{is also a}} {{designer}} for furniture; he created for example the chair [...] "Vio" [...] (according to {{the elements of a}} violin) and <b>the</b> <b>sideboard</b> [...] "Boomerang" [...] (named after the curved throw stick).|$|E
2500|$|Library: The {{portion of}} the player's deck that is kept face down and is {{normally}} in random order (shuffled). When drawing a card, it is always the top card of the library. This is often erroneously {{referred to as a}} player's deck. However, the rules of Magic state that all cards in play (on the battlefield), in a player's hand, in the graveyard, exiled by any means, and even in <b>the</b> <b>sideboard</b> technically make up the player's [...] "deck".|$|E
2500|$|Pabst's [...] "largest {{existing}} work" [...] {{is thought}} to be the John Bond Trevor mansion, [...] "Glenview" [...] (1876–77), in Yonkers, New Yorkpart of the Hudson River Museum complex. The mansion's mantels are credited to Pabst in an 1877 newspaper article; and the interior woodwork, ebonized library, and grand staircase are attributed to him. Although {{there is no evidence of}} Furness's involvement, Pabst used design elements that can also be found in Furness commissions—the parlor's mantel features the dog-faced beasts that flank fireplaces in several Furness houses, the entrance hall features door frames and a chimneypiece with shingled roofs (a frequent Furness motif). The 1877 article specifically credits the dining room's [...] "very elaborate buffet" [...] to Pabst, although only its base survives. Its relief-carved fox-and-crane panels, copied from a plate in Charles Eastlake’s book Hints on Household Taste, are repeated on <b>the</b> <b>sideboard</b> at the Art Institute of Chicago, and on other pieces.|$|E
50|$|In {{multipurpose}} arenas, {{the penalties}} being served {{will appear in}} the multi-purpose panels, used for player statistics in basketball, with shots on goal in the same position as team fouls for basketball. In some arenas <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> of <b>the</b> hockey rink feature three or four LED displays the size of one advertising hoarding which will show scoring information and promotional messages, though their limited visibility makes them rarely used.|$|R
50|$|Most {{were painted}} in bright colours; the Burrell {{standard}} was 'Lake Crimson' with 'Deep yellow' wheels. George Tuby's engines were distinctively painted Great Eastern blue with yellow wheels and lining. Other embellishments included elaborate scroll paintings, {{this was especially}} popular around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Typically <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> had <b>the</b> name of either the proprietor or of the ride the engines were working with picked out in gold.|$|R
50|$|The Steel Arch Universal Pattern Mark I {{was issued}} in 1891. This {{was found to}} irritate riders and in 1893 it was {{discontinued}} in favour of the Mark II. In 1898 the Mark III appeared, which had {{the addition of a}} V-shaped arrangement of strap billets on <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> for <b>the</b> attachment of the girth. This girthing system could be moved forward or back to obtain an optimum fit {{on a wide range of}} horses.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept is}} nearly {{impossible}} to emulate in ice hockey due to <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> and Plexiglas panels which keep the ice surface, team benches, and penalty boxes completely separate from the crowd, and the high probability of injury from attempting to storm the ice surface without skates (likewise with arena football or indoor soccer due to the same partitioning devices being used). A few attempts to do so have usually ended with physical player intervention.|$|R

50|$|The world's first winged car, {{known today}} as a winged sprint car, was created and driven by Jim Cushman at the Columbus Motor Speedway (Ohio) in 1958. In the early 1970s, many sprint car drivers began to put wings with <b>sideboards</b> on both <b>the</b> front and top of their cars. The added wings {{increased}} the downforce generated on the car, with {{the opposite direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>sideboards</b> helping to turn the car in the corners. The increased traction makes the car faster and easier to control.|$|R
50|$|It {{was back}} to {{business}} for McLaren in qualifying, with Coulthard outpacing Häkkinen for pole, and Ferrari's Schumacher and Eddie Irvine keeping things neat by qualifying third and fourth. However, the men in red had hoped for better, and had followed Tyrrell's lead in fitting 'side-wings' - x-shaped wings bolted atop <b>the</b> <b>sideboards.</b> But these appendages did not produce enough of a gain to topple the McLarens and, with Jordan and Sauber also sprouting these peculiar side-wings the sport's governing body voted to ban them {{the day after the}} race, as they felt that they would be unsafe if a driver suffered a side-on impact.|$|R
