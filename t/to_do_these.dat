5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

25|$|Some {{patients}} develop lymphedema, as {{a result}} of axillary node dissection or of radiation treatment to the lymph nodes. Although traditional recommendations limited exercise, a new study shows that participating in a safe, structured weight-lifting routine can help women with lymphedema take control of their symptoms and reap the many rewards that resistance training has on their overall health as they begin life as a cancer survivor. It recommends that women start with a slowly progressive program, supervised by a certified fitness professional, in order to learn how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> types of exercises properly. Women with lymphedema should also wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise sessions.|$|E
25|$|If {{the wife}} dies, {{even if not}} due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, {{in the opinion of}} the Talmud, be one {{conducted}} in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.|$|E

25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> other things {{if he or she}} is chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E
25|$|Within most scenes, {{the player}} {{can control the}} main {{character}} by moving them around the environment; they can also hold down a button to see what thoughts are going through the character's mind, and trigger them to hear an internal monologue on that thought. When the player is near an object or another character they can interact with, they will be presented with a context sensitive icon that represents what control they need <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>These</b> controls include pressing {{a button on the}} DualShock controller, moving the analogue sticks in a specific manner, or rotating the motion-sensitive controller in a specific way; in the version with PlayStation Move support, further actions based on the Move controllers are also present. These actions may lead to additional actions to fully complete the interaction. Some scenes impose a timer on the player, requiring them to complete the necessary actions in time to avoid the death or incapacitation of that character. In other scenes, the player does not have full control of the character but must instead be prepared to respond to these icons in the manner of quick time events, such as during a hand-to-hand fight or while driving frantically {{on the wrong side of}} the road.|$|E

During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach {{and validity of the}} message of the founder. For his canonization homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, [...] "it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34)." ...|$|E

On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.'

500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains [...] "my income is very small and now I'm required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me." [...] However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves {{at the time of his}} death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.|$|E

The episode made mention of the first X-File case to have been opened, apparently initiated by J. Edgar Hoover in 1946; whilst it also references the events of the earlier first season episode [...] "Beyond the Sea", as Scully is seen discussing her father's death. [...] "Shapes" [...] marked the first time an episode of The X-Files had made use of Native American themes and folklore. Whilst this episode was a stand-alone 'monster-of-the-week' story, later episodes beginning with the second season finale [...] "Anasazi", would begin to incorporate Navajo cultural references into the show's overarching mythology.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{expiration}} {{of his contract}} on the Star Wars newspaper strip, Williamson found that the weight of doing both pencil and inks suddenly became stressful to him, drastically reducing his output. As a response to this, in the mid-1980s Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an inker, beginning at DC Comics inking Curt Swan on Superman #408–410 and #412–416. The longtime Man of Steel artist would later describe Williamson as [...] "his favorite inker". Williamson then moved to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as John Buscema, Gene Colan, Rick Leonardi, Mike Mignola, Pat Oliffe, John Romita Jr., Lee Weeks, and many others. John Romita Sr., Marvel's art director during that time, considered Williamson to be [...] "one of the best pencillers {{in the world but}} he really can't make a living at penciling because he wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them. That's why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he's working with." [...] He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997.|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know.

500|$|Practical - Full {{contact system}} where {{the core of}} the combat is {{completely}} dependent on what your character can do, not what your character has the stats <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>These</b> types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism.

Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights and if they do, they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E
