40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the following scenario. A set of n jobs with different threads is being run concurrently. Each job has an associated weight, which gives the proportion of processor time {{that it should be}} allocated. In a single time quantum, p threads of (not necessarily distinct) jobs receive one unit of service, and we require a rule that selects those p threads, at each quantum. Proportionate fairness means that over time, each job will have received an amount of service that is proportional to its weight. That aim cannot be achieved exactly due to the discretisation of service provision, but we can still hope to bound the extent to which service allocation deviates from its target. It is important that any scheduling rule be simple since the rule will be used frequently. We consider a variant of the Surplus Fair Scheduling (SFS) algorithm of Chandra, Adler, Goyal, and Shenoy. Our variant, which is appropriate for scenarios where jobs consist of multiple <b>threads,</b> <b>retains</b> the properties that make SFS empirically attractive but allows the first proof of proportionate fairness in a multiprocessor context. We show that when the variant is run, no job lags more than pH(n) - p + 1 steps below its target number of services, where H(n) is the Harmonic function. Also, no job is over-supplied by more than O(1) extra services. This analysis is tight and it also extends to an adversarial setting, which models some situations in which the relative weights of jobs change over time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} shape {{analyses that}} can achieve a state space reduction exponential {{in the number}} of <b>threads,</b> while <b>retaining</b> sufficient precision to verify sophisticated properties such as linearizability. The key idea is to abstract the global heap by decomposing it into subheaps, losing correlations between them, in a state-sensitive fashion. We consider sequential and concurrent programs, with both coarse- and fine-grained control. Abstraction by decomposition can be used to approximate and achieve threadmodular abstractions, but need not be so imprecise. These new shape analysis algorithms are instances of an analysis framework based on heap decomposition, which we present here. The chief technical challenge was developing a flexiblyspecified transformers. We have implemented this abstraction framework in a system that allows rapid prototyping of complex static analyses by specifying different decomposition schemes. Our initial results confirm the value of heap decomposition in scaling concurrent shape analyses. 1...|$|R
60|$|The {{construction}} of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, {{like those of the}} Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity {{to the back of the}} bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic <b>threads,</b> and <b>retain</b> the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} the “inducer grafting” technique for regeneration of the semitendinosus (ST) tendon after its harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods Twenty knees of 20 patients (mean age at the time of surgery, 23. 1 [*]years) underwent ACL reconstruction with a double bundle autograft using the ST tendon (7 patients) and the ST + the gracilis (G) tendons (13 patients). “Inducer grafting” technique After harvesting the ST tendon, a passing pin with a loop thread is inserted along with the tendon stripper. The passing pin is pulled out from the medial thigh and the loop <b>thread</b> <b>retained.</b> As an inducer graft, the ST tendon branch is used. After the ACL graft has been secured, the inducer graft is sutured to the pes anserinus and the proximal end passed through by pulling the thread out. Then the inducer graft is placed within the tendon canal. The mean follow-up period was 15 [*]months. The presence and morphology of the regenerated ST tendon were examined by MRI. And the isometric hamstring strength was examined at 45 °, 90 ° and 120 ° of knee flexion. Results One month after the operation in all the patients, MRI demonstrated a low-intensity structure at the anatomical location of the ST, {{at the level of the}} superior pole of the patella and the joint line, apparently representing the regenerated ST tendon. Four months after the operation, the distal portion of the regenerated ST tendon had reached the pes anserinus in all patients. Twelve months after the operation, the regenerated ST tendon was hypertrophic in 19 of the 20 patients (95 %). The isometric knee flexion torque of the ACL-reconstructed limb was significantly lower at 90 ° and 120 ° compared with the contralateral limb. Conclusion These results suggest that the “inducer grafting” technique is able to improve the regeneration rate of the harvested ST tendon and promote hypertrophy of the regenerated ST tendon, extending all the way to the pes anserinus. However, this technique couldn’t improve the deficits in knee flexion torque after ACL reconstruction. </p...|$|R
50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a <b>threaded</b> fastener <b>retains</b> the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for specifying and verifying full functional (partial) correctness of modules of multithreaded imperative programs that implement or use lock-free data structures for interthread communication. The approach extends separation logic with simple atomic spaces, which are regions of memory {{that may be}} accessed concurrently using atomic operations. A fixed invariant is associated with each atomic space. The specification of an atomic operation consists of the usual precondition and postcondition, {{as well as a}} number of proof obligations. The precondition requires permission to access an atomic space. The proof obligations state that, in the specific context of the call, the atomic space’s invariant can be rewritten to separate out the lock-free data structure, and that updating the data structure preserves the invariant. To allow <b>threads</b> to <b>retain</b> information about the state of the data structure, a combination of fractional permissions and ghost cells is used in a way similar to the use of auxiliary variables in Owicki-Gries reasoning. The approach has been implemented in the VeriFast program verifier, and used to verify an implementation and a client program of a multiple-enqueueer, single-dequeueer lock-free queue.

40|$|Multilayer {{techniques}} such as: tape wrapping, braiding, and filament winding represent versatile and economical routes for fabricating composite tubes and cylindrical structures. However, multilayer architectures lack the radial reinforcement required to <b>retain</b> <b>threads</b> when the desired means of connection or closure is a threaded joint. This issue was {{addressed in the}} development of a filament wound, carbon-carbon composite impact shell for the NASA radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The problem of poor thread shear strength was solved by incorporating a number of radial elements of triangular geometry around the circumference of the thread for the full length of thread engagement. The radial elements significantly increased the shear strength of the threaded joint by transmitting the applied force to the balance of composite structure. This approach is also applicable to ceramic composites...|$|R

A cemented total hip arthroplasty was implanted using a standard posterior approach. The osteotomy hardware was totally covered with a new cortical bone formation. A layer of bone tissue was removed, the screw heads were broken and the nail plate was also removed. The screw <b>threaded</b> portions were <b>retained</b> because they did not interfere with cemented femoral stem implantation. Fourteen years after total hip arthroplasty, the patient reported no pain and expressed high satisfaction with the surgery.

40|$|Thus far, we’ve {{written about}} {{concurrency}} {{as if the}} only way to build concurrent applications is to use threads. Like many things in life, this is not completely true. Specifically, a different style of concurrent programming is often used in both GUI-based applications [O 96] as well as some types of internet servers [PDZ 99]. This style, known as event-based concurrency, has become popular in some modern sys-tems, including server-side frameworks such as node. js [N 13], but its roots are found in C/UNIX systems that we’ll discuss below. The problem that event-based concurrency addresses is two-fold. The first is that managing concurrency correctly in multi-threaded applications can be challenging; as we’ve discussed, missing locks, deadlock, and other nasty problems can arise. The second is that in a multi-threaded application, the developer has little or no con-trol over what is scheduled at a given moment in time; rather, the programmer simply creates threads and then hopes that the under-lying OS schedules them in a reasonable manner across available CPUs. Given the difficulty of building a general-purpose scheduler that works well in all cases for all workloads, sometimes the OS will schedule work {{in a manner that is}} less than optimal.
