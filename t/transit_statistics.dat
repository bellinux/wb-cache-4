50|$|The town's Community Services Department {{managed the}} Peace River Transit, a small bus network {{operated}} by the Bus Company. The 2006 Census indicated that 1.4% {{of people in the}} Peace River used public transit to go to work, while 7.3% chose to walk or bike to work (the provincial averages are 9.2% and 7.1% respectively). According to the Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey, 38% of the lower income earners used Peace River <b>Transit.</b> <b>Statistics</b> from Community Services Department indicated that the ridership had been on a steady climb since its inception in 2005. By June 2010, the number of rides provided for that month was almost 80% of the total rides provided in the entire year of 2005. Because the transit buses were not wheelchair accessible, special taxi passes were also made available at a discounted rate to seniors, mentally/physically challenged persons, low income individuals/families and students at Northern Lakes College through the Community Services Department. Peace River's transit system was discontinued in early 2011, due in part to high operating costs. However, the taxi pass program is still available to eligible individuals.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} information {{on the use of}} liquefied natural gas and distribution in Europe and worldwide. Paper has information displayed on the largest liquefied natural gas exporter and importing countries. View of liquefied natural gas <b>transit,</b> storage <b>statistics</b> and specific features in urope is provided. Has been studied accident statistics in the world linked with liquefied natural gas, as well as the analysis has been made of the most frequent causes of accidents. During this research, calculations was carried out assessing the possible fire of liquefied natural gas (hereinafter LNG) in order to assess its consequences and prevalence, as well as assessing the potential impact of atmospheric in fire spread, also calculations were made to assess the blast wave spread. Other calculations were made in connection with LNG low temperatures and effects that could appear by inhaling evaporated LNG vapours. Research summarizes {{some of the most important}} occupational health and safety risks associated with the LNG storage, accidents and leak consequences, as well as offering some propositions of solving these problems...|$|R
40|$|The nearly {{circular}} (mean eccentricity ~ 0. 06) and coplanar (mean mutual inclination ~ 3 deg) {{orbits of}} the Solar System planets motivated Kant and Laplace {{to put forth}} the hypothesis that planets are formed in disks, which has developed into the widely accepted theory of planet formation. Surprisingly, the first several hundred extrasolar planets (mostly Jovian) discovered using the Radial Velocity (RV) technique are commonly on eccentric orbits (~ 0. 3). This raises a fundamental question: Are the Solar System and its formation special? The Kepler mission has found thousands of transiting planets dominated by sub-Neptunes, but most of their orbital eccentricities remain unknown. By using the precise spectroscopic host star parameters from the LAMOST observations, we measure the eccentricity distributions for a large (698) and homogeneous Kepler planet sample with <b>transit</b> duration <b>statistics.</b> Nearly half of the planets are in systems with single transiting planets (singles), while the other half are multiple-transiting planets (multiples). We find an eccentricity dichotomy: on average, Kepler singles are on eccentric orbits with ~ 0. 3, while the multiples are on nearly circular (= 0. 04 ^{+ 0. 03 }_{- 0. 04 }) and coplanar (= 1. 4 ^{+ 0. 8 }_{- 1. 1 } deg) orbits similar to the Solar System planets. Our {{results are consistent with}} previous studies of smaller samples and individual systems. We also show that Kepler multiples and solar system objects follow a common relation ~(1 - 2) x between mean eccentricities and mutual inclinations. The prevalence of circular orbits and the common relation may imply that the solar system is not so atypical in the galaxy after all. Comment: 2016 PNAS published, see [URL]...|$|R
40|$|By {{surveying}} new {{fields for}} the shortest-period "big" planets, the Kepler spacecraft {{could provide the}} statistics to more clearly measure the occurrence distributions of giant and medium planets. This would allow separate determinations for giant and medium planets {{of the relationship between}} the inward rate of tidal migration of planets and the strength of the stellar tidal dissipation (as expressed by the tidal quality factor Q). We propose a "Hot Big Planets Survey" to find new big planets to better determine the planet occurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler will be able to find as "big", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of giant and medium planets (above and below 8 earth radii). The distribution of planets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period giant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration, likely from scattering from further out. The numbers of planets at these short periods is still small, leaving uncertainty over the result that the distribution shows the expected power index for inward tidal migration. The current statistics make it hard to say whether the presence of more giant planets at the shortest periods despite there being more medium planets at most periods indicates a greater migration of giant than medium planets. We propose a repurposed Kepler mission to make enough 45 -day observations to survey 10 times as many stars as in the survey of the original field, to survey for planets with periods of up to fifteen days with at least three <b>transits.</b> The current <b>statistics</b> make it hard to say whether the presence of more giant planets at the shortest periods despite there being more medium planets at most periods indicates a greater migration of giant than medium planets.

40|$|This work aims to the {{modeling}} of CO transport in one section considered {{critical of the}} Boqueron I tunnel, located {{on the outskirts of}} Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, with a scenario where vehicles are stopped by an interruption of traffic. This scenario considers a relationship between the number of large-sized vehicles (buses or trucks) and small-sized vehicles (passenger cars) reported by <b>transit</b> <b>statistics</b> and also, it considers the semi-transverse ventilation system in the tunnel. It is explored the influence of the ventilation on the flow patterns and its relationship to the regions with the highest CO concentration. The finite-volume based finite element method is used for the discretization of the computational domain and the integration of the governing equations. The transient 3 D-incompressible Navier-Stokes, energy, mass and species conservation equations, along with the k-e turbulence equations, were discretized, using higher-order numerical schemes in space. The numerical simulation is performed using a fully implicit coupled treatment of the set of resulting discrete transport equation...|$|E
40|$|Dakota Driver of the Year. Drivers are {{nominated}} from transit projects {{across the}} entire state. A driver is selected based on their outstanding performance. Mike has been employed at James River Transit since October 2001. He began as a fill-in, part-time driver. It soon became apparent that his skills went well beyond some fill-in driving hours, and James River offered him a regular part-time driving schedule plus the added responsibility of scheduling all maintenance and repairs for our vehicles. Mike currently works full-time. In addition to all the duties previously listed, Mike tracks all gas purchases for the fleet of vehicles, monitors and reports all <b>transit</b> <b>statistics,</b> and receives all transit income. The passengers have benefited greatly from his dedication and willingness to go {{above and beyond the}} call of duty. He is a model of customer service. Mike is self-motivated and consistently does more than is asked of him. He also volunteers time outside of work to assist with our many fundraisers. Mike is a true professional i...|$|E
