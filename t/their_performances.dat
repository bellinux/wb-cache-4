40|$|Some {{performers}} {{become so}} {{consumed by the}} demands and pressures of performing that they neglect other priorities in their life. However, some individuals succeed in <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> domain and still have their lives together [...] -they approach <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> {{with a sense of}} perspective (Brown, Cairns, & Botterill, 2001). Though the perspectives of adult performers have been outlined in the literature, it is unclear what perspective adolescent participants bring to <b>their</b> <b>performance.</b> The participants were ten young performers (seven athletes and three musicians) selected from a private school in central Canada. They were identified both as top performers and as individuals who had their lives together. In depth interviews revealed the elements that characterize the perspective these participants bring to <b>their</b> <b>performance.</b> Results indicate these adolescents strive to maintain balance in their lives, build relationships with others that assist them in <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> pursuits, approach obstacles with a positive perspective, grow through learning and improving, use a complete focus to absorb themselves in performing, and find passion in <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> pursuits and live this passion everyday...|$|R

The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 requires agencies to assess the completeness and reliability of <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> data. However, GAO found that only five of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies' assessed the completeness and the reliability of <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> data in the transmittal letters accompanying <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> reports for fiscal year 2000.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to clarify the phenomenon that lower achieving students tend to evaluate <b>their</b> own academic <b>performance</b> less accurately {{than those who do}} better in their studies. Previous studies have found that lower performers generally overestimate while higher performers underestimate <b>their</b> <b>performance.</b> The current study analyses self-assessment behaviour and efficiency among Hungarian higher vocational education students. We found that the lowest level of higher education students typically overestimate <b>their</b> <b>performance.</b> Our results strengthen the empirical evidences from previous studies that showed that higher-achieving students evaluate <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> more accurately than their lower achieving fellows. Furthermore we found that higher-achieving students tend to over-assess their examination results to a lesser degree than low-achieving students.
