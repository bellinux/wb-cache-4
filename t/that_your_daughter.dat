60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER [turning him towards Ellie]. Is <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter?</b> [He {{releases}} him].|$|E
6000|$|... "You will see, sir, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> escaped," [...] Philip said, {{handing him}} the letter. [...] "She {{is now in}} the safe custody of Madame de Landres." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no money}} at all to speak of," [...] Tavernake answered. [...] "That really isn't important. I shall very soon make all <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> can spend." ...|$|E
60|$|BELLO: (Laughs mockingly) <b>That's</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> you owl, with a Mullingar student.|$|R
60|$|Chr. And <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughters</b> are so envious, {{that they}} would raise a false report to ruin me.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Thomas {{gave him}} a flat refusal. [...] "I think that I may boast <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> {{happiness}} is in my charge," [...] said Frank Houston.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You were in {{the small}} time once, Joe. You mustn't look down on him because he's a beginner. I know you feel <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> is marrying beneath her, but--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, sir, but we {{are very}} late already, and our friends will have become alarmed; therefore, with your leave, we will, {{as soon as we}} hear <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> has recovered, go on our way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. We but {{put on this}} attire {{over our}} own {{in order to be}} able to {{traverse}} the streets without interruption. May I ask how it is <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> was alone and unattended in the streets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that things}} are going so hard for you, in a {{financial}} way, it would be some satisfaction to feel <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> future was safe," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours and Lady Tringle's, {{and your}} daughters', no doubt. At any rate, Sir Thomas, you {{will think of}} this again. I am sure you will think of it again. If you find <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> {{happiness}} depends upon it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{there are}} many more, but there's one good woman in the world," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>that's</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b> Come {{and tell me that}} the Bank of England is getting shaky on its legs, and I'll listen to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have endeavoured {{to do my}} duty by your children, and a {{very hard}} time I've had of it. If you think <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> is now {{conducting}} herself with propriety, I can only wash my hands of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{at least}} not so far as I have heard of. Mary {{said that they were}} talking together, and {{something}} was said about Miss Carne's murder; <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> turned very pale, and that she {{thought she was going to}} faint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Madam,--There is {{a little}} girl living in your neighbourhood, in whose father I have a deep interest. I am {{particularly}} anxious to give this child, Gertrude Marrot by name, a good plain education. Understanding <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> has had considerable experience in teaching the young, and is, or has been, engaged in tuition, I venture to propose that she should undertake the training of this child, who will attend at your daughter's residence for that purpose at any hours you may deem most suitable. In the belief <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> will {{have no objection to}} accept of this trust I enclose a cheque for 50 pounds-- the first year's salary--in advance. I am, dear madam, your very obedient servant, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak of {{an angel}} and behold his wings," [...] said Robinson, with a faint smile. [...] "I come on a visit which might befit an angel. Mr. Brown, I consent <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> dowry shall be paid from the funds of the firm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Parents, the State can {{no longer}} be {{responsible}} for the [...] mind and character of your children. From the first day of [...] the coming year, all schools will be closed for an [...] indefinite period. Fathers, see <b>that</b> <b>your</b> boys are trained [...] to be men. Mothers, see <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughters</b> are trained to [...] be women.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] the Marquis expostulated, [...] "you are {{behaving}} {{in a most}} unreasonable manner. I am here to discuss the past. For any wrong which you may consider I have done you, I express my regret. I suggest to you <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> present position in life should reconcile you to what has happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Grant quietly, [...] "don't you {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> Euphemia {{said something that}} evening about the land Lige had OFFERED you, and you snapped up the young lady rather sharply for letting out secrets, and THEN you went out? At least that's my impression." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Hastily.) Oh, not {{a breath}} of {{suspicion}} or anything of that sort, I assure you. But it doesn't strike me as exactly appropriate <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> and my wife should be friendly with this fire-eating anarchist who is always attacking us and all that we represent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, but Gervas since {{told me that}} he had {{met some}} of my Lord's men who told him <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> was one of the Queen of Scots' ladies, and said he, 'I held my peace; but methought, It hath come of the talebearing of that fellow to whom my wife prated.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Peris who {{had seen}} Gul {{consumed}} by her love for me now interceded with the king, and said: [...] "It is clear <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> fortunes are bound up with his, for the fire has not hurt him. It is best {{to give him the}} girl, for they love one another. He is King of Waq of Qaf, and you will find none better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity {{that you}} cannot make some public statement, <b>that</b> unless <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> marries {{a man of}} whom you approve you will give her no fortune whatever." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You {{have put}} it to me <b>that</b> you want <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b> Take <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b> If she has no clothes {{go out and buy}} her some.|$|R
60|$|SAVOYARD. Oh, I beg pardon. I quite {{agree that}} harlequinades are rot. Theyve been dropped at all smart theatres. But from what Billy Burjoyce told me I {{got the idea}} <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> knew her way about here, and had {{seen a lot of}} plays. He had no idea she'd been away in Venice all the time.|$|E
60|$|Duen. Well, sir, {{since you}} have forced that letter from me, and {{discovered}} my real sentiments, I scorn to renounce them.--I am Antonio's friend, {{and it was my}} intention <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> should have served you as all such old tyrannical sots should be served--I delight in the tender passions and would befriend all under their influence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> {{shall not}} die of this disaster. It is true, I {{have no power}} to undo entirely what my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a {{profound}} sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know as well}} as I do, Mrs. Presty, <b>that</b> if <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> {{is forced}} to choose between us she will decide for her husband. You have the night before you for consideration. I have no more to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad indeed, signor, that I am {{not to be}} called, {{and that}} this affair of the {{conspiracy}} {{is not to be}} brought up. I would, with your permission, now return home. Giuseppi took a message to my father from me, the first thing, explaining my absence; and I told him, when we left your house, to go at once to tell him <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughters</b> had been recovered, and that I should return before long. Still, he will want to hear from me as to the events of the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked who}} it was. I was told <b>that</b> it was <b>your</b> <b>daughter!</b> Miss Edith's step-sister! Forgive me, Colonel! I {{had to tell}} you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' she continued, 'it is {{the dead}} hand of my dead child, and I bear {{it with me}} that I may never forget, never for one short hour, that I live that I may see Wambe die, and be avenged. Will you bear it, my father, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> and your daughter's child should be so treated by a Matuku? Will ye bear it, men of my own people?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Trotty Veck, my boy! It’s got about, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> {{is going}} to be married to-morrow. There an’t a soul that knows you that don’t wish you well, or that knows her and don’t wish her well. Or that knows you both, and don’t wish you both all the {{happiness}} the New Year can bring. And here we are, to play it in and dance it in, accordingly.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{is another}} proof, Mr. Hawtrey, that our {{suspicion}} that Truscott {{is at the}} bottom of it all is well founded,' Captain Hampton said, when he had heard the story. 'It must have been somebody who was accurately acquainted with your affairs; some one who knew that Mr. Singleton was an intimate friend; so intimate <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> would be likely to go to him were she in any trouble, and that he would be likely to assist her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are to {{understand}} {{nothing of the}} sort," [...] Francis answered. [...] "I told you everything I knew at <b>that</b> time of <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> movements." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE GENTLEMAN. Thank you. One moment, Captain. [The captain halts and turns. The gentleman goes to him affably]. Do {{you happen}} to {{remember}} but probably you don't, as it occurred many years ago-- <b>that</b> <b>your</b> younger <b>daughter</b> married a numskull? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is <b>that</b> sick girl <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> Ian?" [...] asked Giles Jackman that night, as {{he walked}} on the shore with his host before {{retiring}} to rest.|$|R
