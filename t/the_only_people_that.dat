Algol may have been named Matohi by the Māori people, but the evidence for this identification is disputed. Matohi ("Split") occasionally came into conflict with Tangaroa-whakapau over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near Aldebaran but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.|$|E
500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

2500|$|Following an {{application}} on 19 December 2012 by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the High Court quashed the verdicts {{in the original}} inquests and ordered fresh inquests to be held. Sir John Goldring was appointed as Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) and West Yorkshire (West) to conduct those inquests.

Upon receiving the April 2016 verdict, Hillsborough Family Support Group chair Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James {{was killed in the}} disaster, said: [...] "Let's be honest about this – people were against us.

60|$|Nevertheless, {{the fame}} of these {{exploits}} performed by Nero {{as a public}} actor, spread gradually throughout the empire, and the subject attracted special attention in the cities of Greece, where games and public spectacles of every kind were celebrated with the greatest pomp and splendor. Several of these cities sent deputations to Rome, with crowns and garlands for the emperor, which they had decreed to him {{in honor of the}} skill and superiority which he had displayed in the histrionic art. Nero was extremely gratified at having such honors conferred upon him. He received the deputations which brought these tokens, with great pomp and parade, {{as if they had been}} embassadors from sovereign princes or states, sent to transact business of the most momentous concern. He gave them audience, in fact, before all others, and entertained them with feasts and spectacles, and conferred upon them every other mark of public consideration and honor. On one occasion, at a feast to which he had invited such a company of embassadors, one of them asked him to favor them with a song. The emperor at once complied, and sang a song for the entertainment of the company at the table.
