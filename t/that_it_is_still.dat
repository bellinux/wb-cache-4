5|$|Sightings of {{the rail}} from 1950 to 2003 were from a {{restricted}} area of West Halmahera Regency, {{at the base of}} the western peninsula of the island, but it was recorded prior to 1950 as far as the southern point of Halmahera. More recent records showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> present in a significantly larger area, including the northeast of the island, and locals claim that it also occurs in the swamps near Kao, in the northwest.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix.

25|$|No {{traces of}} the {{superstructures}} once capping tomb S9 have survived and determining its type—mastaba or pyramid—remains difficult. Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie believed S9 was a mastaba, because of the enclosing wall which they thought would have held the sand packed {{on top of the}} substructures. However, the royal nature of S9 and S10 as well as their architectural similarities to pyramids of the late Middle Kingdom in the area of Memphis have led Wegner to suggest S9 might have been a pyramid too. In spite of these arguments, the Egyptologist Aidan Dodson asserts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> unclear whether S9 was a mastaba or a pyramid.|$|E

25|$|Subramanian {{also points}} out the {{limitation}} of book to explain the recent economic development in China and India. Under an authoritarian regime (theoretically extractive political institutions), China has achieved rapid economic development while democratic India (theoretically inclusive political institutions) has lagged much behind. According to Surbramanian, one can say that China and India are outliers or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> too early to decide (that is, China might collapse and India might catch up according to the book's prediction). However, it is still unsatisfying that the theory is unable to explain the situation of 1/3 of the world's population, and {{it is unlikely that}} China or India will change drastically in the near future, according to the prediction.|$|E

25|$|Though the VCD {{technology}} can support it, most films carried on VCDs {{do not contain}} chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped.

This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.|$|E
25|$|How far these snakes {{can strike}} has been controversial. Obviously this {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, it is almost impossible to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature about how far these snakes can strike. Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> not wise to trust such values if only because it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E
25|$|Moscow State University {{is one of}} Russia's {{most prestigious}} {{institutions}} of higher learning, and has demanding entry requirements for prospective students. Nonetheless, it performs inconsistently in international rankings. While it was placed 77th overall by the Academic Ranking of World Universities and 112th by QS World University Rankings, it was not included among the top 200 universities by recent Times Higher World University Rankings and came in at 296th (based on the full THE World University Rankings in their iPhone application). On a highly cited and consistent ranking, Moscow State University ranked 43rd in 2008, 44th in 2009–2011, and 45th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance. Despite its large number of faculties, Moscow State University seems to be strong mostly in natural sciences and mathematics (currently placed between 38th and 75th in the world) but considerably weaker in other disciplines. Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the highest ranked Russian university according to the three international rankings mentioned above (with the nearest Russian competitor being Saint Petersburg State University that scored 300–400th), the university was consistently placed outside top 5 nationally in 2010–2011 by Forbes and Ria Novosti / HSE, with both ratings based on data set collected by HSE from Russian Unified State Exam scores averaged per all students and faculties of university.|$|E
