50|$|On 15 May 2009, <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> {{radiator}} panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically {{shut off}} from the ETCS, by the computer-controlled closure of a valve.

30|$|Step 1. Create and get {{boundary}} {{points of}} <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> region {{to create a}} queue to store boundary points of <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> region.

For each pixel point of image mask, if the pixel value is 1, and its eight-neighborhood pixels value at least one is 0, then store the pixel to created the queue. Eventually, the queue is boundary points of damaged region.|$|R

5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (<b>the</b> <b>damage</b> that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> {{was less than}} expected, given {{the strength of the}} cyclone. Most of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> occurred due to the poor infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops. A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E
50|$|Claimants {{are also}} {{expected}} to take reasonable measures to mitigate the loss.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} reduce the {{potential}} threat to the Guanyindian highway bridge caused by <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> RC bridge pier, some damage detection methods including surface inspection, core-drilling test, ultrasonic-rebound test and verticality measurement are used to assess <b>the</b> bridge’s <b>damage</b> condition. <b>The</b> finite element analysis software is employed to simulate <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> bridge pier and to calculate its bearing capacity, thus providing technical data for the repair and future maintenance of the bridge pier. According to <b>the</b> results of <b>damage</b> detection and calculation, the verticality, the concrete strength, the bearing capacity and the crack width of <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> No. 1 bridge pier could meet the code’s requirement but <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> regions on <b>the</b> bridge pier need to be repaired...|$|R

40|$|Conformational {{properties}} of a UV-damaged DNA decamer containing a cis. syn cyclobutane thymine dimer (PD) {{have been investigated}} by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results from MD simulations of <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> decamer DNA show a kink of ∼ 21. 7 � at <b>the</b> PD <b>damaged</b> site and a disruption of H bonding between the 5 ′-thymine of the PD and its complementary adenine. However, no extra-helical flipping of the 3 ′-adenine complementary to the PD was observed. Comparison to two undamaged DNA decamers, one with the same sequence {{and the other with}} an AT replacing the TT sequence, indicates that these properties are specific to <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA. Essential dynamics (ED) derived from the MD trajectories of the three DNAs show that the backbone phosphate between the two adenines complementary to the PD of <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA has considerably larger mobility {{than the rest of the}} molecule and occurs only in <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA. As observed in the crystal structure of T 4 endonuclease V in a complex with <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA, <b>the</b> interaction of the enzyme with <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA can lead to bending along the flexible joint and to induction of adenine flipping into an extra-helical position.
