2500|$|Some Deadheads use {{the term}} [...] "X Factor" [...] to {{describe}} the intangible element that elevates mere performance into something higher. Publicist and Jerry Garcia biographer Blair Jackson stated that [...] "shows were the sacrament ... rich and full of blissful, transcendent musical moments that moved the body and enriched the soul." [...] Phil Lesh himself comments on this phenomenon in his autobiography by saying [...] "The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact <b>that</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Augustine, one {{of western}} Christianity's most {{influential}} early Christian thinkers, described the soul as [...] "a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted {{to rule the}} body". Some Christians espouse a trichotomic view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (soma), soul (psyche), and spirit (pneuma). However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how spirit and soul are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view <b>that</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is body and soul. Paul said that the [...] "body wars against" [...] the soul, [...] "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing {{as far as the}} division of soul and spirit" [...] (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that [...] "I buffet my body", to keep it under control.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim <b>that</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind {{and that there is a}} place in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E
2500|$|Caputo {{worked as}} the {{campaign}} manager for Carl Paladino in his 2010 bid for Governor of New York. Caputo was profiled in a subject piece about him during the campaign in The New York Times; the paper said of his campaign strategy: [...] "Michael R. Caputo's impish spirit and no-holds-barred campaign style have helped propel his boss, Carl P. Paladino, a relatively unknown real estate mogul from Buffalo, to the Republican nomination for New York governor". Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and {{in an interview with}} The New York Times, his campaign manager embraced the outsider nature of their bid in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election: [...] "This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows <b>that</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything." [...] Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager to The New York Times: [...] "I'm facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes. You've got to let them know {{they are going to get}} punished." ...|$|E
