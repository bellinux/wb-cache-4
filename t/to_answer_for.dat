5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's reign was an {{extremely}} short one; only weeks after his accession, he was slain on Mann. His killer is identified by a contemporary source as a knight named Ívarr {{who may have been}} an ally of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's second cousin once removed, Haraldr Guðrøðarson (fl. 1249), who seized the kingship immediately following the killing. Although at first Haraldr was recognised as a legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England (died 1272), Haraldr was later regarded as a usurper by his Norwegian overlord, Hákon. In 1250, Hákon summoned Haraldr to Norway <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> his seizure of the kingship, and Haraldr was kept from returning to the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Two {{young couples}} {{trespass}} on the Place's lake shore, {{only to be}} driven off by the Master and Lad. A week later, Lad is taken {{to compete in a}} dog show in Beauville. One of the men from the lake is there to show his boss' champion Lochaber King. He plots to dye Lad's coat red to embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy.|$|E
5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes he would need <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
5|$|The 1863–64 season saw Wills' {{engagement}} to Anderson collapse, possibly {{due to his}} womanising, and {{it was revealed that}} he had been mismanaging Cullin-la-ringo, in part by squandering family finances on alcohol while claiming it as station expenditure. The trustees demanded that he stay in Victoria <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> the property's runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr's XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand. Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII {{at the end of the}} tour in Melbourne. He faced the trustees soon after. His mother struggled to condemn him but ultimately approved his dismissal from Cullin-la-ringo, thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio's will.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter of principle, since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, he summoned the King to appear before an ecclesiastical council <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E

Two days later Van Dorn halted the retreat at Grenada. Following the defeat at Corinth, Van Dorn was sent before a court of inquiry <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> his performance there. Though he was acquitted of the charges against him, Van Dorn would never be trusted with the command of an army again, and he was subsequently relieved of his district command.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{historian}} Les Carlyon {{wrote that}} while Haig {{was slow to}} adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Carlyon also wrote out that there was a case <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>for</b> his support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Young {{appointed}} {{three of}} the twelve apostles—Lyman, Charles C. Rich, and George Q. Cannon—to {{the presidency of the}} church's European Mission. On March 16, 1862, Lyman preached a sermon in Dundee, Scotland, which all but denied the reality of and the necessity for the atonement of Jesus Christ, which is a central tenet of the LDS Church. His speech appeared to have been overlooked for years, but on January 21, 1867, Lyman was brought before his fellow quorum members <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> his heretical words. Lyman confessed his error and apologized to the quorum. He wrote a letter of apology to the general membership of the church, which was published in the Deseret News.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of sending}} his deposed {{predecessor}} back to Copenhagen <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> his stewardship over the company's affairs, {{and to act}} as defendant in a suit brought by his brother Nicholas, he clapped him into confinement, first keeping him at the fort as his guest, but later putting him in a prison cell.

By this time, matters had grown rather beyond her power of control despite all her influential friends and her genius for intrigue, so she confined herself to taking measures to save what she could of the family property. She returned to St. Thomas in December to share the hardships of prison life with her husband.|$|E
25|$|A new rite for Thanksgiving after Adoption {{preceded the}} {{revision}} of the Old 'Churching of Women' service. Baptism could now {{be incorporated into the}} main Sunday service, the result of other influences intended to bring it back into the mainstream of worship. The Baptism of those able <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>for</b> themselves was much more prominent, a result of the influence of those who questioned infant baptism in a post-Christian society. The questions, however, now addressed to the godparents or the person baptised directly, no longer required the renunciation of the devil or 'the vain pomp and glory of the world' or 'the carnal desires of the flesh' but instead a turning to Christ, a repentance from sin and a renunciation of evil. Likewise the ancient Apostles Creed was replaced by three tritheistic questions, which were criticised (by, among others, John Habgood, sometime Archbishop of York) as being unknown to the credal discussions of the Church, Eastern or Western, modern or ancient.|$|E
