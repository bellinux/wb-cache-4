5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Intimacy were {{inspired}} by a relationship break-up Okereke went through {{at the end of}} 2007. The lyricist told Rolling Stone, [...] "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clichéd break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the past." [...] The move to more intimate subject matter was [...] "semi-conscious" [...] because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: [...] "Ares" [...] draws its name from the god of war, [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and [...] "Zephyrus" [...] draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that [...] "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". [...] "Better Than Heaven" [...] references the Garden of Eden and , because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.|$|E

I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the year it was released.

500|$|In 1908, Chamberlin {{was hired}} to lead the Biology Department at Brigham Young University (BYU), [...] a {{university}} {{owned and operated by}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), during a period which BYU president George H. Brimhall sought to increase its academic standing. LDS College professor J. H. Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, though, I think, he is only about 28 years of age. I have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted historical criticism of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were not to be taken literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically." [...] Chamberlin believed that evolution explained not only the origin of organisms but of human theological beliefs as well.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very good here [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a sense of where her need comes from, if there was some hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E

500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray {{gave the}} second part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was [...] "the {{difficult}} middle chapter {{of the first half of}} this crossover" [...] and that [...] "the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold." [...] He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a Justice League issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein.|$|E
500|$|Professional {{television}} critics deemed Martin Keamy {{a welcome}} {{addition to the}} cast.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger reflected, [...] "He was only on the show for a season and not featured all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> that season, but Kevin Durand always made an impression as Keamy. [...] Lots of actors might have his sheer physical size, but there's a sense of danger (insanity?) that you can't build at the gym, you know?" [...] IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that [...] "Keamy {{is one of the}} more striking new additions to Lost [...] season ... and is a welcome addition to the Lost universe." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that Keamy has [...] "so much charisma" [...] and she would [...] "rather find out more about [...] than most of the old-school Lost characters". [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts agreed with a reader's reaction to Durand's [...] "chilling portrayal" [...] of Keamy and posted it in his weekly column. [...] The reader, nicknamed [...] "huntress", wrote [...] "love him or hate him, nobody is neutral when it comes to Keamy, which is the hallmark of a well-played villain.

2500|$|On World Trade Organization (WTO) and Capitalism vs Socialism: [...] The WTO and GATT type of {{agreements}} are very undemocratic.

MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique.

2500|$|The tapes {{revealed}} several crucial {{conversations that}} took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized {{many aspects of the}} Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a “cancer on the presidency.” The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: “That’s the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [...] is involved in that; John [...] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that’s an obstruction of justice.” Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately.

2500|$|Such sentiments also {{extend to}} members of the real Roman Catholic Church. Real priests and nuns sent their letters in {{alternately}} praising and condemning the series. In July–August 1997, the US Catholic League stated that [...] "it does object to the comic strip characters that appear in the Warrior Nuns comic strip, a product of Antarctic Press." [...] In another example Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a speaker for Washington, D.C.'s United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that Areala's costume is [...] "offensive. The habit is something sacred." [...] That is seen in early issues with how the upper half of the muscled, buxom Sister Shannon's ultra-low cut battle habit would show cleavage and/or show perpetually erect nipples through the cloth while the lower half consists of a loin cloth, if <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> other Warrior Nuns. It was a seeming contradiction in terms with how a nun's habit is meant to hide the body in order to discourage lust. In fact, Ben Dunn wrote that the reason he did that was that [...] "nipples sell". Regardless, Dunn stated the loin cloth is [...] "for mobility" [...] and that is the official in-continuity explanation that the modest Sister Shannon herself unapologetically espoused when confronted on her seeming lack of modesty. (This was resolved by having Sister Shannon's superior assign the Warrior Nuns new more modest battle habits that covered their breasts in the second series to replace the previous ones that she felt were [...] "a bit too revealing!")
