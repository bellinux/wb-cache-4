5|$|Sasha {{has gone}} back to the forest to raise her three kits, Hawk, Moth, and Tadpole. While hunting for her kits, she is caught by a ShadowClan patrol. Afraid that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> her kits, she lies and says they died from the cold. Afterwards, she lets her kits play outside, but when they go back in, she tells them about Ken.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E

5|$|Self-managed work teams (also {{referred}} to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine how they will accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> to complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process. They also select their own members and evaluate the members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety.|$|E

As a result, it has become a rallying point to the Circassian activist organizations.|$|E

25|$|Six {{signalling}} {{systems are}} used in New Zealand: automatic signalling rules (ASR), double line automatic (DLA), single line automatic (SLA), centralised traffic control (CTC), track warrant control (TWC), and station limits. Signals are of the colour light type and operate on speed signalling principals, i.e. signals tell the driver what speed they should proceed, but not necessarily the route <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take.</b> The Auckland suburban network is also equipped with European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling and train protection.|$|E

25|$|Third, then {{states that}} the water rights are {{reserved}} {{as soon as the}} portion of the reservation cases where competing users of the water source have prior appropriation dates of said water source, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> precedence over the American Indian rights. Only those with prior appropriation dates take precedence, those with later dates are subordinate to the American Indian reservation in question. In most cases, it is found that American Indian tribes do in general have senior priority dates for quantities of surface water than competing settlements.|$|E
25|$|This {{question}} about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and constituency grammars) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and constituency are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they dependency- or constituency-based, will likely reject {{the notion that the}} functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.|$|E
25|$|Approach {{motivation}} can {{be defined}} as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is rewarded or results in a positive/desirable outcome. In contrast, avoidance motivation {{can be defined}} as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a negative/undesirable outcome. Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations. Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.|$|E

25|$|Prospective medical {{students}} enter {{either one of}} the two faculties of medicine available (held by The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong) from high schools. The medical program consists of 5 years for those who take the traditional Hong Kong's Advanced Level Examination (HKALE) for admission, or 6 years for those who take the new syllabus Hong Kong's Diploma of Secondary School Education Examination (HKDSE). International students who take examinations other the two mentioned will be assessed by the schools to decide if <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> the 5-year program or the 6-year one.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} TRAMs {{when it is}} {{possible}} for another player to win at least one trick is penalized either by having to play the remainder of the hand with their cards exposed, by forfeiting all remaining tricks (at the discretion of the player who would otherwise take the trick, to prevent intentional false TRAMing that would give the player an advantage), or by forfeiting their bid (the hand will be scored as if that player failed to make their bid regardless of the number of tricks they take). It is always acceptable for players to play the remainder of tricks normally, even if they are positive <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> all remaining tricks.|$|E

25|$|Zelena, Snow, David, and Hook {{soon find}} {{themselves}} in a new realm, but Zelena has no way to return as her wand broke upon arrival. The four come across a frightened groundsman who warns them they shouldn’t be there, only to have another man appear and use magic to knock the unwanted visitors out. Hours later, they wake up in a cage of enchanted bars and are greeted by the warden, who believes that the Dark One must have sent them; they are enemies. They convince the warden that Gold is their enemy as well, and their arrival was an accident on his part in trying to wake Belle; however, the warden keeps them prisoner anyhow. The groundsman then visits the four, and agrees to help them if <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> him to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|Desmarest's hutias {{normally}} live in pairs, but can {{be found}} individually or in small groups. They are diurnal and do not burrow, so during the night they rest in hollows in rocks or trees. They are omnivorous but eat mostly bark, leaves and fruit. Occasionally <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> small vertebrates such as lizards. Both males and females scent mark their territory with urine. They breed throughout the year with a gestation period of between 110 and 140 days (normally around 120 to 126 days), although peak breeding season is in June/July. They normally produce between one and three young, weighing an average of 230g (8oz). The young are precocial, with fur, fully open eyes {{and the ability to}} walk. They are weaned at around five months and reach sexual maturity at around ten months. In captivity they live for eight to eleven years.|$|E
