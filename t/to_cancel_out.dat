5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> such errors.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E

5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

25|$|As {{electrical}} power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung {{on either side}} of cross bars on utility poles, shared the route with {{electrical power}} lines. Within a few years, the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called wire transposition, <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> the interference.|$|E

25|$|Typically, one {{batch of}} medicinals is {{prepared}} as a decoction of about 9 to 18 substances. Some {{of these are}} considered as main herbs, some as ancillary herbs; within the ancillary herbs, up to three categories can be distinguished. Some ingredients are added in order <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> toxicity or side-effects of the main ingredients; on top of that, some medicinals {{require the use of}} other substances as catalysts.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{observations}} is made of the spectrum of light emitted by a star. Periodic variations in the star's spectrum may be detected, with the wavelength of characteristic spectral lines in the spectrum increasing and decreasing regularly {{over a period of}} time. Statistical filters are then applied to the data set <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> spectrum effects from other sources. Using mathematical best-fit techniques, astronomers can isolate the tell-tale periodic sine wave that indicates a planet in orbit.|$|E
25|$|In a {{paramagnetic}} material there are unpaired electrons, i.e. atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons {{are required by}} the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out,</b> an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves {{in the same direction}} as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.|$|E

30|$|Actually, the {{ultimate}} goal of this section is to show that if the MC transmission channel is modeled by slowly decaying recursive filter, then its partial equalization can be done only through canceling its transfer function poles, causing interference.

25|$|A second {{experiment}} {{conducted during}} a trip to Paris involved a propeller-driven bicycle designed by Bossi. The test rider achieved a speed of 23 miles (37km) per hour, but one drawback was noted: the gyroscopic effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable. Bossi concluded, erroneously, that a successful human-powered aircraft would therefore require two counter-rotating propellers <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> the effects of torque â€“ similar to the design of a helicopter. In light of these findings, Bossi decided to design an aircraft incorporating this difficult requirement.|$|E
25|$|Scalp EEG is {{sensitive}} to extracellular volume currents produced by postsynaptic potentials. MEG detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> in a spherical volume conductor The decay of magnetic fields {{as a function of}} distance is more pronounced than for electric fields. Therefore, MEG is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity, which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy. Finally, MEG is reference-free, while scalp EEG relies on a reference that, when active, makes interpretation of the data difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{stages of}} the air {{campaign}} were managed into three; attacking Soviet reserves beyond German artillery; raids against harbour facilities, airfields, fortresses and shipping; cooperating with German artillery <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> Soviet mortar and gun batteries. Richthofen acknowledged {{that not all of}} these components could be conducted simultaneously. He chose shattering the fortifications through relentless air bombardment as most important. To do this, Richthofen garnered most of the air units into supporting the land operations. His view of anti-shipping operations, and von Wildâ€™s conduct of them, was scathing. However, he did {{not take into account the}} systemic technical problems with German U-Boat and aerial torpedoes which were unreliable, and blamed von Wild and the air units instead for failing to achieve much success.|$|E

25|$|Zvezda uses {{gyroscopes}} and thrusters to turn itself around. Gyroscopes do {{not require}} propellant, rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning {{in the opposite direction}} to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section. When gyroscopes 'saturate', thrusters are used <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> the stored momentum. During Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters. When an ATV, NASA Shuttle, or Soyuz is docked to the station, it {{can also be used to}} maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting. Shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Tetsuo {{tries to}} resurrect Kaori, {{a girl he}} had been acquainted with {{who was killed in}} the battle. He succeeds to a small degree, but she returns to life blind, cold and in agony, so he lets her die once more. He retreats to Akira's {{cryogenic}} chamber beneath the stadium, carrying her body. Kaneda and his friends appear to fight Tetsuo once more, but his powers transform him into a monstrous, amoeba-like mass resembling a fetus, absorbing everything near him. Tetsuo pulls the cryogenic chamber above-ground and drops it onto Lady Miyako's temple. Lady Miyako dies while defying Tetsuo, but not before guiding Kei into space to fire upon him with SOL. Kei's attack awakens Tetsuo's full powers, triggering a psychic reaction similar to Akira's. With the help of Kiyoko, Masaru, and a resurrected Takashi, Akira is able <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> Tetsuo's explosion with one of his own. They are also able to free Kaneda, who was trapped in Tetsuo's mass, and he witnesses the truth about the Espers' power as they, alongside Akira and Tetsuo, ascend to a higher plane of existence.|$|E
25|$|The XP-82 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. Initially, the left engine was a V-1650-23 with a gear {{reduction}} box to allow the left propeller to turn opposite to the right propeller, which was driven by the more conventional V-1650-25. In this arrangement both propellers would turn upward {{as they approached the}} center wing, which in theory would have allowed better single-engine control. This proved not to be the case when the aircraft refused to become airborne during its first flight attempt. After a month of work North American engineers finally discovered that rotating the propellers to meet in the center on their upward turn created sufficient drag <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>out</b> all lift from the center wing section, one quarter of the aircraft's total wing surface area. The engines and propellers were then exchanged, with their rotation meeting on the downward turn, and the problem was fully solved. The first XP-82 prototype (44-83886) was completed on 25 May 1945, and made the type's first successful flight on 26 June 1945. This aircraft was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 30 August 1945, whose officials were so impressed by the aircraft, while still in development, that they ordered the first production P-82Bs in March 1945, fully three months before its first flight.|$|E
