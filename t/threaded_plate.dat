40|$|Objective: Internal fixators with angular {{stability}} {{have been}} developed to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. Angular and axial stability of a plate-screw construct can be achieved using a conically threaded screw head undersurface and a corresponding conically <b>threaded</b> <b>plate</b> hole. Furthermore, the insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. This is not always achieved in clinical practice and may result in screw loosening. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Methods: Locking screws were inserted in an isolated (Point Contact Fixator, PC-Fix) or combined (Locking Compression Plate, LCP 4. 5) locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The optimal insertion angle for these plates is perpendicular to the plate surface. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 [degrees] (optimal condition), 5 [degrees], and 10 [degrees] respective to the optimal angle (variance +/- 1 [degrees]). The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. An Instron materials testing machine was used. Results: Locking screws inserted in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 [degrees] and 10 [degrees] angle. Using an optimal insertion angle (0 [degrees]), failure load was 1480 +/- 390 N, with 5 [degrees] axis deviation 780 +/- 160 N, P = 0. 0001, and with 10 [degrees] axis deviation 550 +/- 110 N, P = 0. 0001. Screws inserted in the combined locking hole (LCP) also showed a significant decrease of push-out force of 77...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{were performed to}} study the mechanical behaviours of newly developed high strength rock bolt components, including rebar, <b>thread,</b> <b>plate,</b> and domed washer. The characteristics of deformation and damage of each component were presented. The stress distribution of plate and domed washer was investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical {{results show that the}} yield and tensile strengths of the developed high strength rebar are 33. 6 %– 58. 3 % and 17. 2 %– 28. 7 % greater than those of the conventional rebar, respectively. The increase in yield strength was higher than that in tensile strength, suggesting an increase in yield to tensile strength ratio and a decrease in elongation. It is well-known that the thread processing may not be of high precision and accuracy as expected, which is characterised as rough thread surface, non-identical tooth height, toe stripping, and cracks in the surface. Hardening during thread processing tends to increase the thread yield and tensile strengths. In this paper, the typical deformation process of arch-shaped plate is classified into five stages. The tested plates exhibited distinct deformation characteristics and bearing capacities due to variations in shape, size, material and presence of washer. It was observed that uneven bottom surface, low bearing arch and large radius of the transitional arc connecting bearing arch and bottom surface were the major reasons accounting for low load-bearing capacity of plates. The performance of domed washer has a close relation with the shape, size, strength, and deformation compatibility with plate. Stress concentration was observed {{on the periphery of the}} contact surface between domed washer and plate, which is significantly influenced by the strength of domed washer and is considered to be 20 %– 30 % higher than that of plate.

40|$|Arcyria denudata {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Myxomycetes found worldwide. The capillitial threads of this species has a variety of surface ornamentation. Its capillitium has been studied using light and {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM). The capillitium consists of a dense network of branching and anastomosing elastic threads 3 ~ 6 μm in diameter. The capillitial threads are marked with variously shaped protuberances; sometimes these protuberances are spirally arranged around the axis. These protuberances are too small to observe with light microscopy. The fine structure of the surface ornamentation of capillitial threads was observed using SEM as papillae, cogs, rings, half-rings, reticulations and longitudinal striations. The threads with cogs, rings or half-rings formed a network composed of irregular ridges on the surface. Certain threads also had fine warts, fine hollows and fine papillae. Plates were observed at the branching points of the <b>thread.</b> These <b>plates</b> had a network composed of fine ridges on the surface.

Designing knitted products {{it is important}} to predict direction and rate of dimensions change, because this can affect physical properties such as air permeability of knits. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of antimicrobial treatment conditions on the structure characteristics, thickness and air permeability of plain and plaited knits.

Clever geometries of thin structures can produce strong constructions while using a minimal amount of material. Computer modeling and analysis of thin and slender structures has {{its own set of}} problems stemming from assumptions made when deriving the equations modeling their behavior from the theory of continuum mechanics. In this thesis we consider two kinds of thin elastic structures; <b>threads</b> and <b>plates.</b> Real-time simulation of threads are of interest in various types of virtual simulations such as surgery simulation for instance. In the first paper of this thesis we develop a thread model for use in interactive applications. By viewing the thread as a continuum rather than a truly one dimensional object existing in three dimensional space we derive a thread model that naturally handles both bending, torsion and inertial effects. We apply a corotational framework to simulate large deformation in real-time. On the fly adaptive resolution is used to minimize corotational artifacts. Plates are flat elastic structures only allowing deflection in the normal direction. In the second paper in this thesis we propose a family of finite elements for approximating solutions to the Kirchhoff-Love plate equation using a continuous piecewise linear deflection field. We reconstruct a discontinuous piecewise quadratic deflection field which is applied in a discontinuous Galerkin method. Given a criterion on the reconstruction operator we prove a priori estimates in energy and L 2 norms. Numerical results for the method using three possible reconstructions are presented...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{search for}} less {{invasive}} treatments, with fast and effective bone regeneration, has {{lead to the}} development of synthetic bioresorbable alternatives for bone graft. The commercial product FisiograftTM gel (Ghimas Spa, Italy), based on lactide-glycolide copolymer, is used as an injectable biocompatible and bioresorbable material for filling bone defects in dental surgery applications. These polymers are also used in the production of suture <b>threads,</b> pins and <b>plates</b> for bone fixation, and barriers for guided tissue regeneration. Objective: The main objective of this pilot study was to observe the initial bone healing response after the application of polylactide-glycolide graft material in adult animals. Material and methods: Bone defects were prepared in right and left femora of 12 month-old male Wistar rats. The defects in one leg received the synthetic graft material and the contra-lateral defects did not receive any treatment. After four days, the animals were subjected to euthanasia, the femora were removed, and tissue blocks were prepared for histological analysis. Results: Blood clot remained in the centre of control defects with initial connective tissue organization on the edges. The graft material was observed in the centre of the treated defects, restricted to the area where it was applied, with neovascularization next to the graft material. The pattern of bone healing did not differ between groups, starting from the margins of the defects and from bone fragments, with neovascularization followed by deposition of non-mineralized bone matrix towards the centre. Conclusion: The results indicate that the lactide-glycolide copolymer gel was effective as a filling and osteoconductive material, allowing tissue healing during its resorption process. Additional studies are necessary to verify its capacity to promote bone regeneration...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the micro-structure of crystalline polymers, particularly as revealed by electron microscopy, {{and also the}} effect of the electron beam on the radiation sensitive specimens under various conditions. Polymer single crystals grown from dilute solution were used for the radiation damage studies, as they are thin (100 andAring;), and a single preparation may contain 10 8 crystals of uniform properties. Preparations of polyethylene (PE), polyoxymethylene (POM), poly- 4 -methylpentene- 1 (P 4 MP), nylon 6 and polyethylene oxide were characterized in the transmission electron microscope, confirming previous work for the most part. The scanning electron microscope, operating in its normal mode, showed even the thinnest single crystals clearly, when they were sedimented onto a metal coated substrate. Attempts to observe the 3 -D pyramidal structure of PE single crystals were unsuccessful. The crumpling seen when crystals floating on glycerol, or freely suspended from a fine mesh, are irradiated in an electron microscope indicates that even if the structure were preserved, by freeze drying or however, {{it would be difficult to}} observe. Thicker, complex, crystals seemed more stable in the scanning electron microscope, and cannot be seen well in the transmission microscope. A chart recorder, picoammeter and special faraday cup were fitted to a Siemens Elmiskop 1 for accurate beam current measurements, and dynamic recording of the varying intensity of polymer crystal images. Reproducible curves for the variation of intensity of one spot in the diffraction pattern were obtained for POM and PE. There was a period, p, of very variable intensity, followed by an exponential decay. The very variable intensity is due to the diffraction contrast of detail, so after p no information could be gained from the crystal, although the diffraction pattern shows it to be largely crystalline at that point. For the particular preparations described, at 100 kV, andnbsp; PE POM andnbsp; p 43 andplusmn; 5 34 andplusmn; 4 values in Coulombs/sq. m. Diff. Pattern Decayed 92 andplusmn; 10 70 andplusmn; 7 It is shown that in the electron microscope, heating and ionic bombardment are negligible effects compared to the electron irradiation. An energy loss analysing microscope applied to PE crystals showed that 1 Coulomb/sq. m. is equivalent to 42 Mrads. at 100 kV in agreement with theory. The density of PE increases sharply on irradiation, and the final product seems much like amorphous carbon. Radiation damage mechanisms are discussed, with special reference to polymers and to conditions in an electron microscope. For POM, PE and P 4 MP the variation in radiation damage rate with beam voltage between 30 kV and 100 kV was found to be accurately andprop;andnbsp;(electron velocity) andminus; 2 as predicted by theory, both simple and complex. With exactly similar samples of PE and POM in the 1 MV electron microscope at U. S. Steel, the trend was the same up to 1 MV. Between 700 kV and 1 MV there was a deviation from proportionality towards even slower damage. Absolute measurements differed by 30 andndash; 50 %. Adapting the scanning electron microscope to transmission, the damage of POM could be studied down to 3 kV. There was a steady increase of damage rate as the voltage was reduced, but it was not possible to compare the results with those at higher voltages. The effect of specimen temperature on damage rate was investigated with a liquid helium cooled specimen stage. In going from room temperature to andlt;andnbsp; 30 anddeg;K the rate was reduced by a factor of 2 (2. 2 andplusmn; 0. 8). This is not enough to outweigh practical difficulties. There is a fundamental noise limit to resolution with a decaying crystal. This has been calculated, and found to be well below anything practically realized. For example random structure 50 andAring; across, and periodic structure of 20 andAring; should be resolvable in a POM crystal, 85 andAring; thick imaged in bright field at 100 kV and 13, 000 times magnification. The real limits are image instability and focus, and there is no good way round either. There is no advantage to be gained from higher beam voltages. Ease of rapid operation of the microscope is the most important factor. Image intensifiers, if easy to use, may be a great help, allowing more manipulation of specimens, and presenting more of the information that is obtained. Thin films of PE and POM were cast from slurry and observed in the electron microscope. PE gives complex crystallographic diffraction contrast which rapidly disappears but another, stronger, contrast builds up showing another structure, and this is retained however large the dose. This beam-induced image looks just like what one might expect from undamaged material, in this case, banded spherulites. Detailed study of the changes, combined with optical microscopy and experiments on single crystals leads to the following conclusion: The beam-induced contrast is due to anisotropic deformation caused by radiation damage. Each crystalline unit expands along a, and contracts along c, while the third dimension, along b, remains constant. This explanation supports the current view of spherulite structure, a collection of radiating twisting lamellae, and may well apply to other polymers and structures. Thin films of PE were drawn at room temperature and annealed at 120 anddeg;C. On irradiation, the drawn regions retracted by around 30 %a, but this is not a measure of contraction along c (predicted as andgt;andnbsp; 25 %) because of the unknown behaviour of interlamellar material. The fibrils seen in drawn PE after irradiation were found to be the radial lamellae, homogeneously deformed, whenever the spherulite structure persisted enough for measurements to be made. An ultra-thin PE film which became in the limit, an open network, was produced in an uncontrolled way. Normal spherulite structure was not observed. Areas seemingly undrawn gave a single crystal type of diffraction pattern, and drawn ribbons looked like a 'shish-kebab', transverse platelets on a fine <b>thread.</b> The <b>plates</b> were 200 andplusmn; 25 andAring; thick, separated by 200 andplusmn; 75 andAring;. The centre to centre period was 380 andplusmn; 40 andAring;. Diffraction indicated that the orientation was very good, with b and c in the specimen plane, and c along the ribbon. The film was quite stable, and diffracting units could be identified with individual platelets. This was a fascinating demonstration of an ideal drawn PE, but it could not be made to order, or investigated systematically. The POM films degraded to a featureless film in the electron microscope with andlt; 20 % of the mass remaining. Optical microscopy showed coarse textured spherulites, beginning to organise into banded spherulites with radial period andgt; 10 andmu;. Initial contrast in the electron microscope showed a radiating structure from well spaced centres. The radiating units gave a single crystal type of diffraction pattern, with a { 101 and# 773; 0 } growth direction. It seems that because of the coarse texture of POM spherulites, a thicker film is needed to give information about the bulk. This would need a high voltage microscope. </p...|$|R
