25|$|The {{very first}} 1999 Acura TL (2G) {{rolled off the}} {{assembly}} line on August 4, 1998. The only option on the sedan was a CD-based navigation system. The 1999 TL's navigation system stored the maps in zones; there were 5 different zones for the U.S. Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) were installed as standard equipment and are located behind <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel.

5000|$|The federal {{criminal}} code has a provision dealing with firearms that imposes a five-year mandatory prison term {{on a person}} who “uses or carries a firearm” both during and {{in relation to a}} drug-related crime. [...] Frank J. Muscarello, the petitioner, was arrested for selling marijuana; {{at the time of his}} arrest Muscarello had a handgun in <b>the</b> locked <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> of <b>the</b> truck in which he was transporting the marijuana. Muscarello’s case was consolidated with another case with similar facts except in the other case the firearms in question were in the trunk of the car belonging to the other defendants’. Muscarello and the other defendants all argued that possessing firearms in a <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> or <b>the</b> trunk of a car fell outside of the scope of the mandatory sentencing statute.|$|R

25|$|The 'Spirit of America' Nova was {{introduced}} in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. Oldsmobile and Buick entered the compact car market; both the Apollo and Omega debuted, using the same bodystyles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> Pontiac's final GTO of this era {{was based on a}} facelifted 1974 Ventura coupe, itself based on the Nova, but fitted with a shaker hoodscoop from the Trans Am.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{option for}} 1958 was a [...] "Trans-Portable" [...] radio {{that could be}} removed from the {{instrument}} panel through <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and used as a portable radio for beaches, picnics, etc. thanks to portable batteries.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{patented}} design {{allowed a}} series of features to be deployed on the spar-frame that would later allow quick development of new models. The original Vespa featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger, or optionally a storage compartment. The original front protection [...] "shield" [...] was a flat piece of aero metal; later, this developed into a twin skin to allow additional storage behind the front shield, similar to <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> in a car. The fuel cap was located underneath the (hinged) seat, which saved {{the cost of an}} additional lock on the fuel cap or need for additional metal work on the smooth skin.|$|E
5000|$|Inside the cars, a {{completely}} new instrument panel with full instrumentation (sans idiot lights) was installed, although the designers {{were not able to}} integrate the available air conditioning into the panel; the evaporator and vents were still hung beneath the dash in a space-robbing box. For the ladies, an [...] "Exclusive Beauty Vanity" [...] with a mirror and makeup tray was fitted in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box <b>compartment</b> on most models. Just in case anyone would forget that Studebaker's <b>glove</b> box contained <b>the</b> vanity feature, the fronts were adorned with the word [...] "Vanity" [...] in golden script.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in his {{capacity}} as umpire, Eddie has stolen a wide array of hats, jumpers and (due to a particularly wild party afterwards) trousers from the other players, and they find O'Jones' car keys. Richie wants to use them for unambitious pranks, and the two find O'Jones' car parked outside the church where O'Jones is getting married. Richie attempts to move the car around the corner so O'Jones can't find it, but his inability to drive means he and Eddie accidentally ram-raid the local off-licence (where Eddie takes cans of beer) and speed off into the countryside. While searching <b>the</b> car's <b>glove</b> <b>compartment,</b> Eddie finds <b>the</b> O'Jones' honeymoon reservation at a hotel in glamorous (by their standards) Wolverhampton, and the two decide to steal the honeymoon as well.|$|R
50|$|Mike {{continues}} to do his enforcer work for Daniel, until Daniel lets his initial success go completely to his head and buys a very flashy Hummer H2. Mike, {{knowing full well that}} Daniel's carelessness will eventually attract police attention, refuses to go to the meeting in the Hummer and walks off when Daniel refuses to acquiesce to Mike's suggestion that they take his 1980s Chrysler instead. A few days later, Daniel's house is burglarized by Nacho, who had found his address in <b>the</b> Hummer's <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> Daniel calls <b>the</b> police, upset that his valuable baseball card collection has been stolen. The responding officers are suspicious of Daniel's Hummer. Investigating further, the officers find a hidden compartment in the wall behind Daniel's couch, apparently found and emptied by the burglar.|$|R

2500|$|On November 27, 1978, Washington, D.C. police detectives {{received}} {{a tip from}} a reliable source describing a man known as [...] "Bandit" [...] who was selling illegal narcotics stored {{in the trunk of}} his car. The informant gave the location of the car and a description of both car and driver. The detectives discovered the parked car, and called for a computer check on the car, which confirmed that the car's owner matched the description and used the alias [...] "Bandit". Shortly thereafter they observed the car being driven by a man matching the description. They stopped the car and ordered the driver out. After noticing a bullet on the front seat, they searched <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and discovered a pistol, at which point they arrested the driver, identified as Albert Ross. A detective then opened the trunk and discovered a closed brown paper bag. He opened the bag and found numerous bags containing white powder, which were later identified as heroin. During a later search, they also found and opened a zippered red leather pouch, which contained $3,200 in cash. No warrant was obtained for these searches.|$|E
2500|$|When {{video footage}} was {{initially}} released, {{it did not}} contain audio, although Chicago Police dashboard cameras should automatically record audio when the video recording is activated. According to a CPD video, [...] "The in-car camera system automatically engages both the audio and the video recording when the vehicles' emergency roof lights are activated" [...] and each vehicle has a front and rear camera and microphone. City officials initially blamed a technical problem. It was later revealed that the audio recording equipment in officer Van Dyke's vehicle had been [...] "intentionally damaged" [...] according to records from police technicians. Another car's audio was disabled because the microphones were in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> with the batteries inserted backwards.

50|$|In <b>the</b> truck's <b>glove</b> <b>compartment,</b> he {{discovered}} {{a set of}} Master-Braces - the metallic bracelets that endowed humans with the Masterforce - and donned them, completing his delivery, which was coincidentally received by the Autobot Pretender, Diver (Waverider). Recognising the Master-Braces, Diver accompanied Ginrai and explained their significance to him, only {{for them to be}} attacked by the Decepticon Godmasters, Buster and Hydra, and forced over a cliff. Accidentally touching the bracelets as he attempted to escape the crushed cab, Ginrai was infused with the Masterforce and a suit of armor materialised around him, healing both himself and the Transtector, as they combined and transformed. Harnessing a Godmaster's natural ability to manipulate Chokon Power - the energy of the heavens (Tenchokon), the Earth (Chichokon) and man (Jinchokon) - Ginrai saw off the Decepticons, and, after a period of deliberation, after which he decided that becoming a Godmaster was the will of God himself, he joined the Autobots.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, a truck {{driven by}} Paul Breithaupt {{collided}} with another vehicle while driving {{on a highway}} near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Three passengers in Breithaupt's truck were killed, and Breithaupt was taken to a local hospital to treat serious injuries. Responding officers found a nearly empty one-pint bottle of whiskey in <b>the</b> truck's <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> While Breithaupt lay unconscious in the emergency room, officers ordered physicians to take a sample of his blood. A chemical analysis of this blood sample determined that Breithaupt was {{under the influence of alcohol}} when the sample was taken. This blood sample was admitted into evidence at trial, and Breithaupt was ultimately convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Breithaupt filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, but the state supreme court denied relief. He then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming the taking of the blood sample violated his rights to substantive due process. On April 23, 1956, the Supreme Court granted Breithaupt's petition for certiorari.|$|R

The grille is chromed and 17 in steel wheels are standard, with 17 in aluminum wheels as an option. The cargo area light includes a removable and rechargeable flashlight while the front dome light incorporates two reading lamps. In Europe this version was also commercialized equipped with a VW-built 2.0 liter turbodiesel engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942 the Mercury Eight's slender bullet {{parking lights}} were {{replaced}} with rectangular units placed {{high on the}} fenders inboard of the headlights. Running boards were now completely concealed under flared door bottoms. The instrument panel now features two identical circles for speedometer and clock with gauges {{to the left of}} <b>the</b> speedometer, a <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> to <b>the</b> right of the clock, and a large radio speaker cover in the center. The grille looked more like that of the Lincoln-Zephyr and Continental. The [...] "Eight" [...] script was gone but an [...] "8" [...] appeared {{at the top of the}} grille center. Horsepower was increased to 100. Mercury's biggest engineering news for 1942 was [...] "Liquamatic," [...] Ford's first semiautomatic transmission. It wasn't much of a success and Mercury wouldn't have another automatic transmission until Merc-O-Matic appeared in 1951, which was of course a true automatic. Mercury production for the short 1942 model year totaled only 1,902. Output was halted in February 1942 as American auto plants were converted to the exclusive production of war material.|$|R

Calkins claimed he followed Williams to the cemetery parking lot and that Williams asked for a ride to a nearby Circle K because he was late for work. (Williams did not work at the Circle K.) According to Calkins, after dropping him off at the Circle K, Williams told him the paperwork for the car was in <b>the</b> vehicle's <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> Calkins claimed that he returned to the Cadillac and discovered that the proper registration was not in the car and that he felt deceived, so he called Circle K from his work issued cell phone and asked to speak to Williams. The clerk allegedly told him over the phone that Williams did not work there. According to the report, Calkins then called in the license plate number and found that the plates were expired. However, further investigation revealed that phone and surveillance records did not back up Calkins' story: {{there was no sign of}} Williams or Calkins on surveillance footage from the Circle K, and the phone records from Calkins' cell phone showed no call to the Circle K. Circle K employees were interviewed, and no witnesses could be found to place Calkins or Williams there. At this point, Marcia Williams filed a complaint against Steve Calkins.|$|R
